<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>There Is No Me Without You: One Woman&#39;s Odyssey to Rescue Africa&#39;s Children</h2><p><p><i>There Is No Me Without You</i> is the story of Haregewoin Tefarra, a middle-aged Ethiopian woman of modest means whose home has become a refuge for hundreds of children orphaned by AIDS. It is a story as much about the power of the bond between children and parents as about the epidemic that every year leaves millions of children, mostly healthy themselves, without family. Originally a middle-class woman with a happy family life, Haregewoin fell into a deep depression after the death of her recently married daughter. But then a priest brought her two children, AIDS orphans, with nowhere to go. Unexpectedly, the children thrived, and Haregewoin found herself drawn back into daily life. As word got out, an endless stream of children began to arrive at her door, delivered by dying parents and other relatives who begged for her help, and, pushing against the limits of her home and bank account, she took more and more in. Today, Haregewoin runs a school, a daycare system, and a shelter for sick mothers. Without medication for her charges&#x2015;some HIV-positive, some uninfected, and some infants trying to fight off the virus, but almost all of whom come to her terrified and malnourished&#x2015;she forges on, caring for as many as she can handle. Increasingly, she also places them for adoption with families like that of journalist Melissa Fay Greene, who has two children adopted from Ethiopia. In Haregewoin Tefarra's story, Greene gives us an astonishing portrait of a woman fighting a continent-wide epidemic.</p></p><p><p>Melissa Fay Greene, award-winning author of <i>Praying for Sheetrock</i>,<i> The Temple Bombing</i>, and <i>Last Man Out</i>, relates a tale that captures the tragedy of an international epidemic and the remarkable people inventing ways to care for its victims. Her Dec. 2002 <i>New York Times Sunday Magazine</i> on the plight of the AIDS orphans inspired scores of adoptions and generated tens of thousands of dollars for the underfunded orphanages of Africa. She has seven children, including two adopted from Ethiopia, and lives in Atlanta.</p>Melissa Fay Greene documents the tragic lives of the children of Ethiopian AIDS victims. Greene focuses on the efforts of Haregowoin Teferra and her orphanage while chronicling how the Ethiopian government and much of the world ignore these innocent children. Greene herself has adopted two children from the orphanage. The highly personal book is read with intensity by Julie Fain Lawrence. Lawrence's emphasis of key phrases and critical events allows listeners to share in what Greene calls "an unfolding disaster." Despite the nature of the material, the story also celebrates the human spirit, and Lawrence's style allows listeners to share Greene's belief that these children can survive, and thrive, in a world that prefers to ignore them.

Richard Longstreth, a renowned and respected author in the field of historic preservation, presents a useful survey of commercial architecture in urban America. He has developed a typology of architectural classification for commercial application in American towns across the United States. Likely to be enjoyed by both students and members of the general public seeking an introduction to commercial architecture, <i>The Buildings of Main Street</i>makes a significant and lasting contribution to American architectural history.</p><p><b>Richard Longstreth</b> is professor of American civilization and director of the graduate program in historic preservation at George Washington University.In 1977, the National Trust launched the experimental Main Street Program in three Midwest communities. Since then, the program to preserve architecturally significant structures has been established in over 1400 communities in 43 states, with mostly successful results. While applauding that effort, Longstreth warns that preservationists should be wary of nostalgic Main Street 'theme park' solutions. His goal in writing the guide is to help preservationists arm themselves with 'knowledge of the buildings' intrinsic qualities and of the legacy they represent.' The well-designed guide is organized by compositional types, such as the two-part commercial block .... Preservationists, architectural historians, and anyone interested in learning more about the rich and varied history of America's towns and cities will want a copy of this model guide. (Anne Miller <i>North Carolina Historical Review</i>)<br><br>First published in 1987, <i>The Buildings of Main Street</i> provided what had not existed before: A concise, coherent typology for identifying commercial buildings.... Longstreth's typology was quickly adopted by many preservation professionals as the standard for identifying and classifying commercial buildings. The 2000 edition contains the original text and photographs with a new preface and bibliography.... Longstreth's commercial typology works equally well to identify buildings in Chicago or Ottumwa, Iowa, and is as significant today as it was when introduced in 1987. (Molly Myers Naumann <i>The Annals Of Iowa</i>)<br><br><i>The Buildings of Main Street</i> is the preeminent source on the subject of commercial architecture and main street commercial districts.

That's the first of many lessons about food, love, and death in Susan Wittig Albert's latest mystery about China Bayles, the Texas Hill Country lawyer turned herbalist and crime solver. Although Albert lives in the Texas Hill Country herself, she swears that China's hometown, Pecan Springs (which must have a higher per capita death rate than anyplace outside of Jessica Fletcher's Maine village), is fictional. So we have to believe that nobody really killed one of the judges of the annual Cedar Choppers Chili Cook-off by adding peanuts to his tasting sample and causing a deadly allergic reaction.<p> But China and her lover, ex-cop Mike McQuaid, believe it--especially after the dead chili judge, Jerry Jeff Cody, turns out to have a swampful of dirty secrets. So Albert begins a clever dance, keeping Bayles and the bedridden McQuaid (shot while working for the Texas Rangers) in just enough danger to maintain an atmosphere of suspense while also slipping in enough chile lore to outfit a chain of Taco Bells. The format may be familiar, but Albert is one of the best in the business at making it look newly hatched.

The story behind its construction is a largely untold and intriguing piece of American history, which acclaimed historian John Steele Gordon relates with verve, connecting it to the colorful saga of the ancient obelisks of Egypt.</p><p>Nobody knows how many obelisks were crafted in ancient Egypt, or even exactly how they were created and erected since they are made out of hard granite and few known tools of the time were strong enough to work granite. Generally placed in pairs at the entrances to temples, they have in modern times been ingeniously transported around the world to Istanbul, Paris, London, New York, and many other locations. Their stories illuminate that of the Washington Monument, once again open to the public following earthquake damage, and offer a new appreciation for perhaps the most iconic memorial in the country.</p></p><p><b>John Steele Gordon</b> is one of America's leading historians, especially in the realm of business and financial history. He is the author of<i> The Scarlet Woman of Wall Street</i>, <i>Hamilton's Blessing,</i> <i>A</i> <i>Thread Across the Ocean</i>, <i>An Empire of Wealth</i>, and <i>The Great Game</i>. He has written for <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Worth</i>, the<i> New York Times</i>, and the<i> Washington Post</i>,<i> </i>and his columns appear regularly in the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>. John Steele Gordon lives in North Salem, New York.<p>"[An] engaging history of the memorial . . . More than the history of a specific obelisk, Mr. Gordon&#x2019;s book is an account of the form itself . . . Shifting effortlessly over three continents and four millennia, Mr. Gordon&#x2019;s account moves briskly despite copious digressions, ranging from the history of the Know-Nothing Party to the conductive properties of aluminum. It&#x2019;s a measure of the author&#x2019;s roving curiosity that there are more than 100 footnotes packed into the brief--and appropriately vertical--volume." &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Do yourself a favor by examining John Steele Gordon&#x2019;s <i>Washington&#x2019;s Monument</i>, everything you need to know--and some things you thought you&#x2019;d never need to know--about one of the capital&#x2019;s most iconic landmarks . . . Even though historian Gordon&#x2019;s work is a short book on a tall subject, he has told it in rewarding detail. [A] thorough account." &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i></p><p>"A delightful book that is just plain fun to read, packed with all kinds of curious facts and oddities." &#x2015;starred review, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Filled with fascinating facts and interesting anecdotes, this is a book that will delight history and architecture buffs and enrich both past and planned visits to Washington, D.C., and its sights." &#x2015;Carolyn Mulac, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"This is a story of intrinsic drama, but in <i>Washington&#x2019;s Monument</i>, John Steele Gordon successfully interweaves it with two others--that of the ancient Egyptian origins of the obelisk and of the much later mania for moving and re-erecting obelisks for reasons of political prestige. In his telling, the Washington Monument is only the latest episode in the 4,000-year history of the obelisk. These three stories are essentially independent of one another, but Gordon artfully cuts back and forth between them. His book itself is a marvel of ingenious construction." &#x2015;<i>Commentary</i></p><p>"This is one of those books where you pursue every footnote, study each illustration, pick up and put down a dozen times over the course of a week.<i> Washington&#x2019;s Monument</i> is too well-researched and too well-written to be called a divertissement, but it&#x2019;s the kind of specialized, quietly elegant little history (narrower and taller than most books, suggestive of its subject) that surprises us with its wealth of detail and the richness of the panorama it unfolds." &#x2015;<i>Dallas Morning News</i></p></p><h2>Defiance: The Bielski Partisans</h2><p>The prevailing image of European Jews during the Holocaust years is one of helpless victims under a death sentence, unable to fight consignment to the ghettos, to the camps, and to the gas chambers. In fact, many Jews struggled alone or with others against the terrors of the Third Reich, risking their lives against overwhelming odds for the slimmest chance of survival, or a mere glimpse of freedom. In <em>Defiance</em>, Nechama Tec offers a riveting history of one such group, a forest community in western Belorussia that would number more than 1,200 Jews by 1944--the largest armed rescue operation of Jews by Jews in World War II.<br> Describing the entire partisan movement in the region, Tec shows that while most forest fighters in Belorussia were rifle-carrying young men, the members of this extraordinary community included both men and women, some with weapons but mostly unarmed, ranging from infants to the elderly. She reconstructs for the first time the amazing details of how these partisans and their families--hungry, exposed to the harsh winter weather, always on the lookout for German patrols--managed not only to survive, but to offer protection to all Jewish fugitives who could find their way to them. Driven by courage born out of despair, they dug wells, set up workshops to repair guns, made clothes, and resoled shoes, supplied services to other guerilla units, and even established a makeshift hospital and school in the forest. Arguing that this success would have been unthinkable without the vision of one man, Tec offers penetrating insight into the group's commander, Tuvia Bielski, and his journey from his life as the son of the only Jewish peasant family in an isolated rural village to his emergence as a leader possessing the charisma and courage to command under all but impossible circumstances.<br> Tec brings to light the untold story of Bielski's struggle as a partisan who lost his parents, wife, and two brothers to the Nazis, yet never wavered in his conviction that it was more important to save one Jew than to kill twenty Germans. She shows how, under Bielski's guidance, the partisans smuggled Jews out of heavily guarded ghettos, scouted the roads for fugitives, and led retaliatory raids against Belorussian peasants who collaborated with the Nazis against their former Jewish neighbors. Refusing to turn away the weak or the old for the sake of the survival of the larger group, Bielski would warn new arrivals to the forest, "Life is difficult, we are in danger all the time, but if we perish, if we die, we die like human beings."<br> A scholar, a writer, and herself a Holocaust survivor, author Nechama Techas devoted the last two decades to studying the fate of European Jewry, recording rare but vital examples of human compassion, resistance, altruism and heroism in the face of overwhelming horror and despair. Drawing on wide-ranging research and never before published interviews with surviving partisans--including Tuvia Bielski himself two weeks before his death in 1987--she reconstructs here the poignant and unforgettable story of those who chose to fight.</p><p>The prevailing image of European Jews during the Holocaust is one of helpless victims, but in fact many Jews struggled against the terrors of the Third Reich. In <em>Defiance</em>, Nechama Tec offers a riveting history of one such group, a forest community in western Belorussia that would number more than 1,200 Jews by 1944--the largest armed rescue operation of Jews by Jews in World War II.

Among his extensive film credits, Zwick is best known for his direction of <em>Blood Diamond</em> and <em>The Last Samaurai</em>.</p> <p> An inevitable rite of passage in any Jewish child&#x2019;s informal initiation to adulthood is to study, with grim fascination, the grainy, out-of-focus images of hollow-eyed survivors in striped pajamas, the amateur photos of corpses piled high in freshly dug pits, or possibly the 16 mm handheld GI footage of living skeletons clinging to barbed wire during the liberation of the camps. Such grisly iconography of passivity and victimization was, during my childhood, and probably is still today, not only an article of faith, but also a source of secret shame. As an assimilated suburban kid growing up in the Midwest, I had thrilled to World War II stories about John Kennedy and PT 109 (Cliff Robertson in the movie version), the leatherneck marines at Guadalcanal (John Wayne), the flying fortresses over Germany (Gregory Peck), and so many more. In feeble contrast, Jewish heroes were the ancient biblical warriors evoked by uninspired Sunday school teachers--Bar Kochba and Judah Macabee wielding spears and jawbones, or young David with his little slingshot.</p> <p>So when my friend and collaborator, Clay Frohman, came to me with a book called <em>Defiance</em>, I was skeptical. "Not another Holocaust movie," I said. What was to be accomplished, I asked myself, in telling yet another story of familiar and unspeakable horror, especially when an entire canon of literature, not to mention films both documentary and fiction, have already dramatized it in the most exacting and harrowing detail? What&#x2019;s more, the greatest historians and philosophers of our time have devoted entire careers to plumbing the roots and magnitude of its evil. What could I possibly add?</p> <p>But Clay was insistent. Here, he said, was something fresh and utterly provocative. And so, somewhat grudgingly, I plunged into Nechama&#x2019;s Tec&#x2019;s remarkable book and found myself deeply moved. That was ten years ago. And the feelings I had upon that first reading have only grown stronger with time. To read of the Bielski brothers and their fight to create a safe haven in the midst of a hell-on-earth evokes in me something utterly primitive and deeply personal, a roiling wave of fear, awe, humility, and admiration. And outrage, too--that such a story was not better known.</p> <p>Here, clutching captured Schmeisser submachine guns and "potatomasher" grenades, were Jewish fighters whose deeds were as stirring and brave as any I had ever encountered. And what&#x2019;s more, it was all true. In an age when the term "hero" has been so overused as to become meaningless, the Bielskis remind us that real heroism is not the stuff of comic books. Rather, it is a set of decisions, sometimes impulsive, often made by simple men of whom nothing of the sort could ever have been expected. Their story is not simply one of courage or fortitude in the face of adversity; it includes any number of daunting moral decisions--whether to seek vengeance or to rescue, how to re-create a sense of community among those who have lost everything, how to maintain hope when all seems forsaken. <strong>Read more</strong></p> <p>Edward Zwick<br>Santa Monica, Calif., 2008 <br></p><br><strong>Nechama Tec</strong> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Connecticut, Stamford.

"There were times when I knew things I shouldn't have known," he writes. "Simple things like who was coming over, or who was on the phone." He knew events in family history that no one had told him about. He was inexplicably fascinated with television characters that possessed supernatural powers. He'd see auras around schoolteachers and hear voices that whispered true information in his mind. Eventually his gifts expanded into hearing the names of spirits "who'd gone to the other side." Finally, as a teenager Edward began to claim rather than question his psychic abilities and committed his life work to pursuing and learning about his gifts. Now that he has become a renowned medium (appearing on numerous talk shows, including <i>Larry King Live</i>), Edwards has written an entertaining "my life as a psychic" type of autobiography, packed with fascinating true stories. At the same time, Edward offers an engaging self-help book, teaching readers how to visit a medium and even showing seekers how they can recognize and develop their own psychic abilities. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>John J. Edward</b> has brought a fresh, young, honest and very skeptical attitude to the world of psychic phenomena. As a psychic, lecturer and medium, he has, over the last twelve years, helped thousands with his uncanny ability to predict future events, and communicate with others who have passed on to the Other Side.<p> John began his psychic work after being read by <b>Lydia Clar</b>, a renowned psychic from the East Coast. She made him aware of the gifts that he possessed and directed him to use them to help others. Since then, his clientele has ranged from young to old, professional to student, American and foreign. His clients wait months for a private appointment with him, and eagerly await his first book about his conversations with the Other Side...entitled <b>One Last Time</b>, due to be published by Berkley and to debut on <b>Larry King Live</b> in November 1998. Edward's video and audio series, developed in 1998, have proven to be key elements in raising awareness about mediumship and psychic phenomena. His work is also the subject a documentary surrently in production about contacting the spirit world.</p><p> Born and raised on Long Island, NY, John exhibited psychic abilities from an extremely early age, and was deemed "special" by many in his family. Because no fuss was made over these early psychic "events", he maintained as normal a childhood as possible. It seemed easy for John to develop his abilities to their fullest because of the acceptance of psychic phenomena in his family. After graduating from high school, John enrolled at C. W. Post College, where he earned a degree in Public Administration and Health Care Administration. He maintained a management position in a leading health care organization in the Northeast, and always continued his research, lecturing, teaching, readings and writing. Because of the large demand for his ability, John now devotes all of his time to his psychic work.</p><p> John lives in Huntington, New York with his wife.</p></p><h2>The Hand of God: Finding His Care in All Circumstances</h2><p><p>Are we hapless victims of life's whims?

Valdaire's Guildmaster had taken everything he had: clothes, weapons, gold, his Guildmaster symbol, and that very damning--in the Guildmaster's eyes--letter of safe passage from the Marshal-General. In return, the Guildmaster had indeed found a room for Arvid, as he'd offered: Arvid had spent several very unpleasant days in the Guildhouse cellar before his kteknik gnome companion Dattur, worried by his absence, had tried to rescue him, only to be captured himself.<br><br>After some additional time in the Guild's cellar, they'd both been dumped into the lower compartment of a trade-wagon and driven out of the city--several days out, in what direction Arvid had no notion--in the untender care of journeymen enforcers who intended to pry every detail of information from them both before killing them.<br><br>Now the journeymen tossed dice for first choice of his weapons, all the while loudly discussing what they intended to do with him. Certain tools were, they'd said, heating in the coals. He would be warm then, one jeered, throwing a hot coal that bounced off his back before he felt more than the sting.<br><br>He heard the fire crackling somewhere behind him. Smoke fragrant with the scent of roasting meat curled past his nose, but where he lay only cold wind caressed him, and his belly cramped with hunger.<br><br>He should have stayed north of the mountains once he was sure the necklace had already gone south. He should have realized that his long absence from Verella had given his second in command--Harsin, with his false smiles--a chance to seize power and proclaim him a traitor to the Guild because he had gone to do the Marshal-General's bidding.<br><br>He would have Harsin's liver roasted on skewers if he got out of this alive, which--at the moment--seemed unlikely. What he needed was a rescue, but who in all Aarenis knew or cared about him? His gnome servant, maybe, but Dattur was trussed up as tightly as Arvid himself, and gagged as well.<br><br>You could ask for help.<br><br>Arvid had heard that voice before, and it was not a voice he wanted to hear. Nor the chuckle that followed. He was not a Girdish yeoman; he had respect for the hero-saint, but . . . it was not for him. Besides, it was Gird's Marshal-General's letter in his pocket that had put him in this mess. If not for her--<br><br>You'd have been hanged long since for the thief you are.<br><br>He was not a thief--he had been a thief, but that was years ago, and anyway--all right, yes, the Marshal-General had saved him from those Girdish who were sure he'd stolen the necklace, but he hadn't. And it was being seen as too friendly with the Fellowship that had turned the others against him.<br><br>Would you have let her die?<br><br>He knew which "her" that was, of course. Paksenarrion. Of course he would not have let that vicious jealous bitch Barra kill her after all she'd suffered--<br><br>And the gods healed.<br><br>Well, yes, that was true, too. But now, here . . .<br><br>You are almost as stubborn as I was, lad.<br><br>Arvid felt a gentle hand on his bruised head and then the sting of something cold on his bare shoulder--one and then another. And another.<br><br>The fire hissed. The men swore and stood, their weapons--some of them his--clanking. "What about them?" one said. "Let 'em drown or freeze," said another. "Take the meat inside." Arvid heard the door of the hut--hardly more than a shed--creak open and then slam shut. Cold rain, the winter rain of Aarenis, pelted down on him, harder every moment. He shivered; his teeth chattered. Cold water ran into his face, melting away the blood that had glued his eyelids shut in the last beating. Under his nose he saw a stretch of dark earth speckled with pebbles glistening in the rain.<br><br>Wet leather stretched. Arvid remembered that even as his hands twisted . . . but it had to be really wet, and he was chilling faster than the leather softened. He struggled on. Hair by hair, the leather thongs stretched. Enough? It had to be enough.<br><br>You could have sent a paladin, he thought into the dark sky.<br><br>She has her task. You have yours.<br><br>It did not seem the right moment to tell that sort of voice that he was not in service to that sort of voice. It was the right moment to escape, if he could. He worked one stiff hand loose, then the other. He could scarcely move his fingers and fumbled at the thongs tying his knees, his ankles. All the time the rain pelted down, hard cold drops--some of them ice pellets now, it felt like. He needed a knife, a sharp-- His hand knocked against something, a loose rock--and he saw the glassy scalloped edge of broken flint as if outlined by the sun.<br><br>He wanted to say, You could have sent a knife, but what if the rock disappeared? By repute, the gods were big on gratitude. He clutched the flint awkwardly, sawed at the thongs, pulling and sawing together, and finally his knees were free and then his ankles. He tried to stand, but the blows he'd taken, the hunger of two days trussed and gagged in a wagon, prevented it. He crawled instead, the flint in his mouth, bruised hands splayed out on the cold mud, bruised knees gouged afresh by the stones, until he reached Dattur, who was himself struggling with his bonds, but unsuccessfully. They had bound the gnome upright to a tree, using a length of rope--and rope did not stretch in the wet, but shrank.<br><br>Arvid sawed away at the rope. One strand then another parted. The gnome finally got free and pulled the gag from his mouth.<br><br>"Master--"<br><br>"Shh . . ." Arvid was shuddering with cold.<br><br>"Give rock." The gnome reached for his hand and pried the flint out of it. Arvid collapsed against the tree trunk. Leafless though it was, it broke the wind and some of the rain. The gnome hopped off the boards the men had placed to keep him from touching the rocky ground; Arvid had a moment to think rock-magery, and then the gnome touched the flint to one of the exposed rocks between the tree roots. The rock opened silently as a mouth, and the gnome and Arvid slid into the gap, out of wind and rain alike.<br><br>Still cold, still wet, still shivering, but alive, for which he should, he knew, be thanking the gods . . .<br><br>Yes.<br><br>He muttered a shaky Thank you in a voice he scarcely recognized as his own, and scrubbed at his arms and body, trying to warm them. Dattur, he realized, had moved to one side of the hole they were in and had begun chanting at the rock. Arvid wanted to ask what he was doing, but as a dim blue-gray light spread from the gnome and his working, he could see for himself. The rock opened without sound or mess . . . The light brightened as if rock were transmuted into light. Did the light show outside? Would the robbers, should they discover him missing, find them by the light coming out a crack in the rock by the tree?<br><br>Arvid forced himself up and staggered to the foot of the hole they'd slid down; a wet cold draft touched his face, and a snowflake kissed his nose. He moved back into the tunnel and huddled near one wall. Their captors wouldn't see anything through snow.<br><br>Under his feet, against the curve of his back, he felt a faint warmth. Was the rock warming up? He flattened one hand against it . . . warmer than he was, at any rate. Dattur was ten full paces away now, chanting in words Arvid did not know; the space in the rock grew distinctly warmer but did not extend. The warmth gave Arvid strength; he pushed himself up and started to walk forward, but a jerk of Dattur's head was a clear signal to stay back.<br><br>Now he could see that the rock was disappearing upward. Arvid tried to calculate direction and distance . . . could it be that Dattur was making a passage into the hut where their captors lay sleeping? That would be disastrous--the two of them, naked and unarmed, could not deal with four armed thieves--but Dattur had proved no fool so far. Arvid leaned back against the rock, felt its warmth drying the hair on the back of his aching head. Just as he finally remembered the rockfolk talent for bringing cold sleep to humans, the entire contents of the hut fell into the gap Dattur had created: walls and roof landing on the packs, pallets, weapons, and men still wrapt in rock-magery. Snowflakes whirled down through the opening, and the cold wet met the tunnel's warmth, melting instantly. Even the fall did not wake the men. Before Arvid could reach the mound of debris, Dattur had burrowed into it, snatched up his own sword, and sliced four throats.<br><br>Without a word, he dropped the sword and held up both hands; stone flowed up and over to close the gap as the light dimmed. Then it strengthened again, and Dattur finally turned to look at Arvid. "It is between us no debt owed for this," he said. "Without my master freeing me, it could not be done. Without my doing, it was no chance."<br><br>"I--thank you anyway, Dattur," Arvid said. "Does it not tire you?"<br><br>Dattur shrugged. "Not this little." He frowned then. "No human should see rockmagic at work. No human should see rockfolk unclothed. I know you have a good memory, master, but . . . do not speak of this."<br><br>"I will never speak of it," Arvid said. Having said that, he had a powerful desire to look, to commit to memory the differences between gnome and human anatomy. Instead he looked down and turned to the heap before them. "I will look for what we need."<br><br>In the end it took both of them to untangle the mess. Finally, clothed in a mix of the thieves' garments and what remained of their own, he and Dattur built a small fire at the end of the tunnel near the tree and ate what food they'd been able to salvage from the dusty pile: two skewers with hunks of half-cooked meat still on them and a loaf of coarse bread. They didn't care; the fire burned off the dirt, or so Arvid told himself.<br><br>"It would be well to leave while falling snow covers our tracks," Arvid said after picking a string of meat from between his teeth with the bodkin he carried.

God has designed us to build our lives around a local church; we cannot be indifferent or uninvolved. Rather, we must be in love with and committed to God&#39;s plan and purpose through the church.

The two knights have been away from the Crusade too long, and are itching to get back to the action. But peculiar things have been happening in the harbour town, and it soon becomes evident that someone is trying to keep Geoffrey and Roger from boarding one of the ships. When Geoffrey&#39;s dim-witted servant is killed by a deadly arrow that was clearly meant for the knight himself, Sir Geoffrey&#39;s fury is such that he would do anything to find the murderer. But then Ranulf Flambard - who is not only the Bishop of Durham and an escapee from the Tower of London, but also happens to be Roger&#39;s father - arrives in Southampton with an errand for his son to perform. Much against Geoffrey&#39;s better judgement, the pair set off for the northern town of Durham, where a magnificent cathedral is being built at Flambard&#39;s behest.

And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?&#34; the disciples asked Jesus. The Savior&#39;s immediate response was &#34;Take heed that no man deceive you.&#34; (Matthew 24:3-4.) Throughout history, the Saints of God have asked questions about the Second Coming, the signs of the times, the end of the world, Armageddon, the Millennium, and countless other aspects of the last days. Yet for many, the answers to their questions remain shrouded in confusion and misunderstanding, making the Lord&#39;s response about deception more chilling. In Behold, I Come Quickly: The Last Days and Beyond, Hoyt Brewster looks at the teachings and prophecies of ancient and modern prophets concerning the times we live in now and the times to come. In a clear and straightforward manner, the author discusses dozens of signs of the latter days and examines many specific prophecies about what has happened and what will happen. He talks about preparedness and the Second Coming. Major topics of confusion, such as the gathering of Israel, God and Magog, the restoration of the Ten Tribes, Adam-ondi-Ahman, and the New Jerusalem, are clarified. The end of the world and Satan&#39;s role in the last days are vividly depicted. The author details what the Millennium will be like and what will happen during it. Readers will also find valuable information on the Resurrection and final judgment. Behold, I Come Quickly relies on the scriptures and the teachings of latter-day prophets to create a memorable, easy-to-understand portrait of the last days.</p><p></p><h2>Trading Identities: The Souvenir in Native North American Art from the Northeast, 1700-1900</h2><p>Tourist art of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is generally of high quality and great aesthetic interest. Yet scholars have largely ignored these objects because their incorporation of Euro-North American influences, in both forms and motifs, has led to their dismissal as commercial, acculturated, and inauthentic. This exclusive location of authenticity and value in an idealized past silences the creative responses of Aboriginal people to repressive official policies of directed acculturation and denies their full participation in historical modernity. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the production, sale, and consumption of tourist art constituted a system for the circulation of objects within which images of Indianness were negotiated. To produce marketable commodities, Aboriginal people constructed images of themselves that mediated European notions of the savage, the natural, and the primitive. By accepting this imagery, colonizers and settlers naturalized their own identities as the rightful successors to the -Indians. While stereotypes of Indianness were being transported into parlours and bed chambers, the objects made for sale were also influencing the things Aboriginal people made for their own use. The beaded purses, pincushions, and shopping baskets brought Euro-American styles and concepts into Aboriginal communities, together with associated ideas of gender roles and domestic organization. An innovative combination of fieldwork, art historical analysis, and historical contextualization, this study is the first rigorous comparison of Native souvenir production with a wide range of Euro-American decorative arts and home crafts to identify the sources of object types and styles and revealing the innovative difference displayed by Aboriginal trade wares. Images newly uncovered in archives and travel literature - including depictions of Native vendors and makers - illustrate the book, along with never before displayed or published objects from museum collections in Europe and North America.</p><p>Ruth B.

There, kilt-wearing participants compete in athletics, Highland dancing, and bagpiping, while others join clan societies in celebration of a Scottish heritage. As Celeste Ray notes, however, the Scottish affiliation that Americans claim today is a Highland Gaelic identity that did not come to characterize that nation until long after the ancestors of many Scottish Americans had left Scotland.<br><br>Ray explores how Highland Scottish themes and lore merge with southern regional myths and identities to produce a unique style of commemoration and a complex sense of identity for Scottish Americans in the South.

That wind piled thick slabs of broken lake ice on the bitterly cold shore, swept dancing snow demons through the streets, sculpted knife-edged snowdrifts against every obstruction, and chewed at any exposed skin with icy fangs. Throughout the city, its poorest inhabitants huddled close to any source of warmth they could find, but for far too many, there was precious little of that to be had, and parents shivered, watching the weather&#x2014;and their children&#x2014;with worry-puckered eyes as they thought about the endless five-days stretching out between them and the half-forgotten dream of springtime&#x2019;s warmth.</p><p>There was no cold inside the Temple, of course. Despite the soaring ceiling of its enormous dome, there weren&#x2019;t even any chilly breezes. The structure reared by the archangels themselves in the misty dawn of Creation maintained its perfect interior temperature with total disdain for what the merely mortal weather of the world might be inflicting upon its exterior.</p><p>The luxurious personal suites assigned to the members of the Council of Vicars were all magnificent beyond any mortal dream, but some were even more magnificent than others. The suite assigned to Grand Inquisitor Zhaspahr Clyntahn was a case in point. It was a corner apartment on the Temple&#x2019;s fifth floor. Two entire sides of its main sitting room and dining room were windows&#x2014;the miraculous, unbreakable, almost totally invisible windows of the archangels&#x2019; handiwork. Windows which were completely transparent from within, yet flashed back exterior sunlight like mirrored walls of finely burnished silver, and which were utterly impervious to the heat&#x2014;or cold&#x2014;which passed through and radiated from windows of mortal glass. Paintings and statuary, all chosen with a connoisseur&#x2019;s exquisite discernment, added their own luxurious beauty to the suite&#x2019;s interior, with its thick carpets, indirect, sourceless lighting, and perfect temperature.</p><p>It was far from the first time Archbishop Wyllym Rayno had visited the Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s personal chambers. Rayno was the Archbishop of Chiang-wu in the Harchong Empire. He was also the Adjutant of the Order of Schueler, which made him Clyntahn&#x2019;s executive officer within the Office of Inquisition. As a result, Rayno was privy to far more of Clyntahn&#x2019;s innermost thought than anyone else, including his colleagues among the Group of Four, yet there were places inside Clyntahn where even Rayno had never been. Places the archbishop had never wanted to be.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in, Wyllym&#x2014;come in!&#x201d; Clyntahn said expansively as the Temple Guardsman always stationed outside his chamber opened the door for Rayno.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Your Grace,&#x201c; Rayno murmured, stepping past the guardsman.</p><p>Clyntahn extended his ring of office, and Rayno bent to kiss it, then straightened and tucked his hands into the voluminous sleeves of his cassock. The remnants of a truly enormous meal lay strewn in ruins across the large dining table, and Rayno carefully avoided noticing that there had been two place settings. Most vicars practiced at least some discretion when it came to entertaining their mistresses within the Temple&#x2019;s sacred precincts. Everyone knew it happened anyway, yet there were standards to be maintained, appearances to be satisfied.</p><p>But Zhaspahr Clyntahn wasn&#x2019;t &#x201c;most vicars.&#x201d; He was the Grand Inquisitor, the keeper of Mother Church&#x2019;s conscience, and there were times when even Rayno, who had served him for de cades, wondered exactly what passed through his mind. How the same man could be so zealous when it came to rooting out the sins of others even while he indulged his own.</p><p>Fair&#x2019;s fair, Wyllym, the archbishop told himself. He may be a zealot, and he&#x2019;s definitely self-indulgent, but at least he&#x2019;s not hypocritical among his peers. And he does draw a remarkably sharp line between sins which are merely venal and those which constitute mortal offenses in the eyes of Schueler and God. He can be as irritatingly sanctimonious as anyone you&#x2019;ve ever seen, but you&#x2019;ve never heard him condemning any of his fellow vicars for weaknesses of the flesh. Spiritual weaknesses, yes; he can be utterly ruthless where they&#x2019;re concerned, but he&#x2019;s remarkably... understanding where those perquisites of high office are concerned.</p><p>He wondered who to night&#x2019;s visitor might be. All of Clyntahn&#x2019;s appetites were huge, and he craved novelty. Indeed, few women could hold his attention for long, and once his interest in them waned, he tended to turn to another with sometimes startling abruptness, although he was never ungenerous when he transferred his interest to another.</p><p>Rayno, as the Inquisition&#x2019;s adjutant, was well aware that there were those within the Temple&#x2019;s hierarchy who disapproved&#x2014;in some cases, strenuously, if quietly&#x2014;of Clyntahn&#x2019;s addiction to the pleasures of the flesh. No one was likely to say so openly, of course, and Rayno had very quietly quashed a few reports of condemnatory comments before they ever reached the Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s ears. Still, it was only natural for there to be a certain... unhappiness. Some of it could probably be put down to pure envy, although he was willing to concede that there was genuine disapproval of such sensuality behind much of it. Indeed, there had been times when Rayno had found himself feeling much the same sort of disapproval. But the archbishop had concluded long ago, even before Clyntahn was elevated to his present office, that all men had flaws, and that the greater the man, the deeper his flaws were likely to run. If Clyntahn restricted his particular faults to the pursuit of fleshly plea sure, surely that was far better than what Rayno had observed in the occasional Inquisitor who found himself using the cover of his high office to indulge his own taste for unnecessary cruelty.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for coming so promptly, Wyllym,&#x201c; Clyntahn continued as he ushered the archbishop to one of the Temple&#x2019;s incredibly comfortable chairs. He smiled as he settled Rayno and personally poured him a glass of wine. The Grand Inquisitor&#x2019;s normal table manners generally took second place&#x2014;or even third&#x2014;to the gusto he brought to food and wine, yet he could be an incredibly gracious and charming host when he chose to be. Nor was that charm false. It simply never occurred to him to extend it to anyone outside the circle of intimates he relied upon and fully trusted. Or, at least, trusted as much as he ever trusted anyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;I realize your message didn&#x2019;t seem to indicate any immediate urgency, Your Grace. I had business in the Temple to attend to anyway, however, so it seemed best to respond to your summons promptly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I only wish I had a dozen archbishops and bishops who were as reliable as you are,&#x201c; Clyntahn told him. &#x201c;Langhorne! I&#x2019;d settle for six!&#x201d;</p><p>Rayno smiled and inclined his head in a small bow, acknowledging the compliment. Then he sat back, nursing his wineglass in both hands while he gazed attentively at his superior.</p><p>Clyntahn was looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the swirling snow and wind. His expression was almost rapt as he contemplated the icy torrent of white for the better part of three minutes. Then, finally, he turned back to Rayno and leaned back in his own chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Well!&#x201d; he said, with the air of someone getting down to business at last. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve read all the reports about the seizures of Charisian merchant ships month before last.&#x201d;</p><p>He arched one eyebrow slightly, an</p></p><h2>Someone to Run With: A Novel (Sifriyah Ha-Hadashah Li-Menuyim, 2000 (1).)</h2><p>Earnest, awkward, and painfully shy, sixteen-year-old Assaf is having the worst summer of his life.

The novel explores the life of Israeli street kids-whom Grossman interviewed extensively for the novel-and the anxieties of family life in a society racked by self-doubt.

A long rope connects the two and gets tangled in the legs of the passersby, who grumble and gripe, and the boy mutters "Sorry, sorry" again and again. In between mumbled sorries he yells "Stop! Halt!"&#x2014;and to his shame a "Whoa-ah!" escapes from his lips. And the dog keeps running.<br><br>It flies on, crossing busy streets, running red lights. Its golden coat disappears before the boy's very eyes and reappears between people's legs, like a secret code. "Slower!" the boy yells, and thinks that if only he knew the dog's name, he could call it and perhaps the dog would stop, or at least slow down. But deep in his heart he knows the dog would keep running, even then. Even if the rope chokes its neck, it'll run until it gets where it's galloping to&#x2014;and don't I wish we were already there and I was rid of him!<br><br>All this is happening at a bad time. Assaf, the boy, continues to run ahead while his thoughts remain tangled far behind him. He doesn't want to think them, he needs to concentrate completely on his race after the dog, but he feels them clanging behind him like tin cans. His parents' trip&#x2014;that's one can. They're flying over the ocean right now, flying for the first time in their lives&#x2014;why, why did they have to leave so suddenly, anyway? His older sister&#x2014;there's another can&#x2014;and he's simply afraid to think about that one, only trouble can come of it. More cans, little ones and big ones, are clanging, they bang against each other in his mind&#x2014;and at the end of the string drags one that's been following him for two weeks now, and the tinny noise is driving him out of his mind, insisting, shrilly, that he has to fall madly in love with Dafi now&#x2014;because how long are you going to try to put it off? And Assaf knows he has to stop for a minute, has to call these maddening tin followers to order, but the dog has other plans.<br><br>Assaf sighs&#x2014;"Hell!"&#x2014;because only a minute before the door opened and he was called in to see the dog, he was so close to identifying the part of himself in which he could fall in love with her, with Dafi. He could actually, finally, feel that spot in himself; he could feel himself suppressing it, refusing it in the depths of his stomach, where a slow, silent voice kept whispering. She's not for you, Dafi, she spends all her time looking for ways to sting and mock everyone, especially you: why do you need to keep up this stupid show, night after night? Then, when he had almost succeeded in silencing that quarrelsome voice, the door of the room in which he had been sitting every day for the last week, from eight to four, opened. There stood Avraham Danokh, skinny and dark and bitter, the assistant manager of the City Sanitation Department. (He was sort of a friend of his father's and got Assaf the job for August.) Danokh told him to get off his ass and come down to the kennels with him, now, because there was finally work for him to do.<br><br>Danokh paced the room and started explaining something about a dog. Assaf didn't listen. It usually took him a few seconds to transfer his attention from one situation to another. Now he was dragging after Danokh along the corridors of City Hall, past people who came to pay their bills or their taxes or snitch on the neighbors who built a porch without a license. Following Danokh down the fire stairs, then into the courtyard in back, he tried to decide whether he had already managed to defeat his own last stand against Dafi, whether he knew yet how he would respond today when Roi told him to quit stalling and start acting like a man. Already, in the distance, Assaf heard one strong, persistent bark and wondered why it sounded like that: usually the dogs all barked together&#x2014;sometimes their chorus would disturb his daydreams on the third floor&#x2014;and now only one was barking. Danokh opened a chain-link gate and, turning to tell Assaf something he couldn't make out over the barks, opened the other gate, and, with a flick of his hand, motioned Assaf down the narrow walkway between the cages.<br><br>The sound was unmistakable. It was impossible to think that Danokh had brought Assaf down here for just one dog; eight or nine were penned in separate cages. But only one dog was animated; it was as if it had absorbed the others into its own body, leaving them silent and a bit stunned. The dog wasn't very big, but it was full of strength and savagery and, mainly, despair. Assaf had never seen such despair in a dog; it threw itself against the chain links of its cage again and again, making the entire row shake and rattle&#x2014;then it would produce a horrifying high wail, a strange cross between a whine and a roar. The other dogs stood, or lay down, watching in silence, in amazement, even respect. Assaf had the strange feeling that if he ever saw a human being behave that way, he would feel compelled to rush up and offer his help&#x2014;or else leave, so the person could be alone with his sorrow.<br><br>In the pauses between barks and slams against the cage, Danokh spoke quietly and quickly: one of the inspectors had found the dog the day before yesterday, running through the center of town near Tziyyon Square. At first the vet thought it was in the early stage of rabies, but there were no further signs of disease: apart from the dirt and a few minor injuries, the dog was in perfect health. Assaf noticed that Danokh spoke out of the corner of his mouth, as if he were trying to keep the dog from knowing it was being talked about. "He's been like that for forty-eight hours now," Danokh whispered, "and still not out of batteries. Some animal, huh?" he added, stretching nervously as the dog stared at him. "It's not just a street dog." "But whose is it?" Assaf asked, stepping back as the dog threw itself against the metal mesh, rocking the cage. "That's it, exactly," Danokh responded nasally, scratching his head, "that's what <i>you</i> have to find out." "Me? How me?" Assaf quavered. "Where will I find him?" Danokh said that as soon as this kalb&#x2014;he called it a <i>kalb</i>, using Arabic&#x2014;calms down a little, we'll ask him. Assaf looked at him, puzzled, and Danokh said, "We'll simply do what we always do in such cases: we tie a rope to the dog and let it walk for a while, an hour or two, and it will lead you itself, straight and steady, to its owner."<br><br>Assaf thought he was joking&#x2014;who had ever heard of such a thing? But Danokh took a folded piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and said it was very important, before he gave the dog back, for the owners to sign the form. Form 76. Put it in your pocket&#x2014;and don't lose it (because, to tell the truth, you seem a little out to lunch). And most important, you have to explain to the esteemed master of this dog that a fine is included. A settlement of one hundred and fifty shekels or a trial&#x2014;and he'd better pay up. First of all, he neglected to watch his dog, and maybe that will teach him a lesson to be more careful next time, and second, as a <i>mi</i>nimal compensation (Danokh enjoyed sucking, mockingly, on every syllable) for the headache and hassle he had caused City Hall, not to mention the waste of time of such su<i>perb</i> human resources! With that, he tapped Assaf on the shoulder a little too hard and said that after he found the dog's owners, he could return to his room in the Water Department and continue to scratch his head at the taxpayers' expense until the end of his summer vacation.<br><br>"But how am I . . ." Assaf objected. "Look at it . . . It's like, crazy . . . "<br><br>But then it happened: the dog heard Assaf's voice and stood still. It stopped running back and forth in the cage, approached the wire mesh, and looked at Assaf. Its ribs were still heaving, but it moved more slowly. Its eyes were dark and seemed to focus intensely on him. It cocked its head to the side, as if to get a better look at him, and Assaf thought that the dog was about to open its mouth right then and say in a completely human voice, Oh yeah? You're not exactly a model of sanity yourself.<br><br>It lay on its stomach, the dog; it lowered its head, and its front legs slipped under the metal grid, begging with a digging motion, and out of its throat a new voice emerged, thin and delicate like the cry of a puppy, or a little boy.<br><br>Assaf bent in front of it, from the other side of the cage. He didn't notice what he was doing&#x2014;even Danokh, a hard man, who had arranged the job for Assaf without much enthusiasm, smiled a thin smile when he saw the way Assaf got down on his knees at the blink of an eye. Assaf looked at the dog and spoke quietly to it. "Who do you belong to?" he asked. "What happened to you? Why are you going so crazy?" He spoke slowly, leaving room for answers, not embarrassing the dog by looking into its eyes for too long. He knew&#x2014;his sister Reli's boyfriend had taught him&#x2014;the difference between talking at a dog and talking with a dog. The dog was breathing fast, lying down. Now, for the first time, it seemed tired, exhausted, and it looked a lot smaller than before. The kennels finally fell silent, and the other dogs began moving again, as if coming back to life. Assaf put his finger through one of the holes and touched the dog's head. It didn't move. Assaf scratched its head, the matted, dirty fur. The dog began to whine, frightened, persistent, as if it had to unburden itself to someone right away, as if it could no longer keep silent. Its red tongue trembled. Its eyes grew large and expressive.<br><br>Assaf didn't argue with Danokh after that. Danokh took advantage of the dog's momentary calm: he entered the cage and tied a long rope to the orange collar hidden in its thick fur.<br><br>"Go on, take it," Danokh ordered. "Now it'll go with you like a doll."

Ranging through the culture of the Middle Ages, he finds in the margins a distorted yet apt reflection of medieval conventions. It is here that medieval artists found room for experimentation, for parodying, modernizing, and questioning cultural authority without ever undermining it.</p><p><b>Michael Camille</b> (1958&#x2013;2002) was professor of art history at the University of Chicago. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Gothic Idol: Ideology and Image-Making in Medieval Art</i>.In vigorous prose and 86 astonishing illustrations, Camille demonstrates how 'Gothic marginal art flourished from the late twelfth to the late fourteenth century by virtue of the absolute hegemony of the system it sought to subvert'--for 'premodern societies used ritualized disruption to reinstate social norms rather than resist them'...In this fine book how exhilarating it is to see our ancestors giggling and roaring in vulgar delight in the comforting shadows of their sacred texts and sanctuaries. (Richard Locke <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>A witty and original account of a fascinating subject. Medieval manuscripts, buildings and sculpture abound with subversive, erotic or scatological marginalia. Why are they there? Do they undermine dogma or just provide light relief? Camille gives some closely-observed and convincing answers. (Chris Savage King <i>New Statesman and Society</i>)<br><br>[A] sprightly and suggestive study. (Richard Eder <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Michael Camille offers us a book that distracts and instructs us simultaneously, in part because images are given as much play as texts. Camille's pages teem with ideas that, like medieval hybrids, are protean in their inventiveness. Rather than condemning the margins of medieval art, Camille celebrates them in animated, even exuberant prose, arguing in the process that their often overlooked representations pose as many problems as the center that more often has riveted our attention.

The legendary physicist Wolfgang Pauli had a phrase for such ideas: He would describe them as "not even wrong," meaning that they were so incomplete that they could not even be used to make predictions to compare with observations to see whether they were wrong or not. In Peter Woit's view, superstring theory is just such an idea. In <i>Not Even Wrong</i> , he shows that what many physicists call superstring "theory" is not a theory at all. It makes no predictions, even wrong ones, and this very lack of falsifiability is what has allowed the subject to survive and flourish. <i>Not Even Wrong</i> explains why the mathematical conditions for progress in physics are entirely absent from superstring theory today and shows that judgments about scientific statements, which should be based on the logical consistency of argument and experimental evidence, are instead based on the eminence of those claiming to know the truth. In the face of many books from enthusiasts for string theory, this book presents the other side of the story.</p><p><b>Peter Woit</b> is a lecturer in the mathematics department of Columbia University, where in recent years he has taught graduate courses in quantum field theory, representation theory, and differential geometry. His math and physics blog, Not Even Wrong (www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress), has been featured in <i>Discover</i> , <i>Seed</i> , and <i>New Scientist</i> . He lives in New York.String theory is the only game in town in physics departments these days. But echoing Lee Smolin's forthcoming <i>The Trouble with Physics</i> (Reviews, July 24), Woit, a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and a lecturer in mathematics at Columbia, points out&#x2014;again and again&#x2014;that string theory, despite its two decades of dominance, is just a hunch aspiring to be a theory. It hasn't predicted anything, as theories are required to do, and its practitioners have become so desperate, says Woit, that they're willing to redefine what doing science means in order to justify their labors. The first half of Woit's book is a tightly argued, beautifully written account of the development of the standard model and includes a history of particle accelerators that will interest science buffs. When he gets into the history of string theory, however, his pace accelerates alarmingly, with highly sketchy chapters. Reading this in conjunction with Smolin's more comprehensive critique of string theory, readers will be able to make up their own minds about whether string theory lives up to the hype. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hooked tells the story of the poaching of the Patagonian toothfish (known to Americans as "Chilean Sea Bass") and is built around the pursuit of the illegal fishing vessel Viarsa by an Australian patrol boat, Southern Supporter, in one of the longest pursuits in maritime history.<br><br>Author G. Bruce Knecht chronicles how an obscure fish merchant in California "discovered" and renamed the fish, kicking off a worldwide craze for a fish no one had ever heard of and everyone had to have. With demand exploding, pirates were only too happy to satisfy our taste for Chilean Sea Bass. From the world's most treacherous waters to its most fabulous kitchens, Hooked is at once a thrilling tale and a revelatory popular history that will appeal to a diverse group of readers. Think The Hungry Ocean meets Kitchen Confidential.</p><p>G. BRUCE KNECHT is a writer for the Wall Street Journal. His work has also been published in The Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times Magazine.<i>Starred Review.</i> The Patagonian toothfish&#x2014;which can live up to 50 years and grow to six feet long&#x2014;is an ugly creature considered too bland for eating by most South Americans. Its high fat content, codlike texture and lack of a fishy taste convinced a Los Angeles fish merchant who found the toothfish in Chile in 1977 that, given an exotic new name, it would do quite well in America. By 1998, "Chilean sea bass" had become the hottest restaurant craze: "[e]veryone had to have it." Knecht (<i>The Proving Ground</i>) weaves a parallel plot, which takes place in the South Indian Ocean in 2003, where an Australian patrol boat is hunting down a pirate vessel for stealing toothfish. The chase takes them thousands of nautical miles away to dangerous Antarctic waters and involves South African mercenaries and a dramatic boarding in dangerous seas. Knecht's gripping book flips between the commercial history of the toothfish&#x2014;just the latest of many culinary fads that end up threatening an ocean species&#x2014;and the chase, which illuminates the practically lawless world of commercial fishing, where factory boats with vast dragnets can devastate a population in just a couple of years, a practice the author calls "the marine equivalent of strip mining." <i>First serial in the Wall Street Journal.

These are the chronicles of Jamethiel Priest&#39;s-bane, otherwise known as Jame, as she struggles to find a place in a universe full of danger, intrigue, and more than a bit of downright lunacy. The current novel&#39;s title To Ride a Rathorn, comes from the Kencyr phrase that refers to someone attempting something insane, but it is too dangerous for them to stop. The reference is also to a certain young rathorn (think of an armor-plated, carnivorous unicorn with a nasty temper) who is after Jame for killing his mother and about to catch up with her. At Tentir, Jame faces cut-throat competition and finds even more buried, poisonous family secrets. Not only is the Caineron heir sent to humiliate her but a charming Ardeth Highborn arrives hell-bent on seducing her.

His two dozen published poetry books went on to influence the Cubists and the Surrealists (playing a part in both groups formation) and his work continued to be viewed, admired and read by poets in Europe and America. Much of his work is still in print today and he is studied and written about as much today as he was some thirty years ago. Small anthologies of his work continue to appear in many languages. This volume is a fairly comprehensive survey of both the verse poems and the prose poems, in a bilingual format, and with prefaces and notes by the editor Mary Ann Caws and Patricia Terry. The Surrealists praised Reverdy as &#34;the greatest living poet&#34; at the time and many modern poets have continued to echo that praise. Reverdy moved to Paris at a young age and continued living there until his death in 1960.</p><p>Pierre Reverdy was born in Narbonne, France in 1910 and died in Paris in 1960. His poetry was influential in the Dadaist, Cubist, and Surrealist movements. The participants in all three groups/movements held him in high esteem and considered him to be amongst the great poets of the time. He also founded and edited the literary journal Nord-Sud which published many of the Dadaist and Surrealist writings and was the go to journal for such avante-garde writings.

Scott Fitzgerald: A Life in Letters: A New Collection Edited and Annotated by Matthew J. Bruccoli</h2><p><b>A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life.</b> <br> In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. <i>A Life in Letters</i> is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. <br> While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary "jazz age" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. <br> For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.</p><p>This volume properly includes a high proportion of letters about writing. The most important thing about Fitzgerald--about any writer--is his witing.F. Scott Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896. He attended Princeton University, joined the United States Army during World War I, and published his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and for the next decade the couple lived in New York, Paris, and on the Riviera. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels include <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died at the age of forty-four while working on <i>The Last Tycoon</i>. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fiction has secured his reputation as one of the most important American writers of the 20th century.</p><h2>Dragon Age: Asunder</h2><p><p>Return to the dark fantasy world created for the award-winning, triple platinum role-playing video game, <i>Dragon Age&#x2122;: Origins</i> in this third tie-in novel, <i>Dragon Age: Asunder</i> by David Gaider!</p><p>A mystical killer stalks the halls of the White Spire, the heart of templar power in the mighty Orlesian Empire.

They said ghosts didn&#x2019;t exist, that the dead didn&#x2019;t really walk amongst the living, but some people believed in them even so. They believed a dead man could become lost on his way to the Maker&#x2019;s side, forever adrift in a land of shadow. <br>Cole wasn&#x2019;t dead. Yet at the same time, he didn&#x2019;t exist, and he walked amongst the living. <br>He&#x2019;d overheard a pair of mages talking about him once, even if they&#x2019;d no idea they were doing so. He&#x2019;d discovered them late at night, huddled in one of the White Spire&#x2019;s dark hallways. There were many such hidden corners in the great tower, places where mages went to escape from the suspicious eyes of watching templars, and Cole knew them all. <br>Cole knew far less about the mages themselves. He knew, however, they&#x2019;d taken a great risk sneaking out of their chambers. Few of the tower&#x2019;s templars were kind, and most believed that mages constantly conspired to commit unspeakable horrors&nbsp;&#x2026; when the truth was usually much more mundane. Most of their conversation consisted of gossip. The mages whispered secrets to each other, sometimes idle speculation about romantic entanglements and other times much more serious things they knew to be true but could never talk about in the open. Occasionally he came upon mages meeting for a romantic liaison instead. They secretly pressed flesh upon flesh, a desperate act of intimacy between people for whom such fleeting moments could only be stolen. <br>He&#x2019;d found the pair who spoke of him only by chance, overhearing their muted whispers as he passed in the shadows. One was a homely woman with long hair the color of straw, the other a gangly elven boy. Both he recognized, but only by sight. They were older apprentices, the sort who had little talent for magic and who&#x2019;d already spent too long preparing for the inevitable. Someday soon they would be called away by the templars for their final ordeal, and Cole would never see them again&nbsp;&#x2026; or he&#x2019;d see them roaming the halls as emotionless Tranquil, stripped of their abilities and doomed to spend their lives in passive service to their tormentors. <br>Cole remembered the dread in their eyes. The homely woman sported a bruise on her cheek, its mottled purple already beginning to fade. From their hiding place the pair watched furtively for any sign of wandering guards, starting at the slightest sound. Even the skittering of a passing rat caused them to jump, yet they did not budge from their hiding place. <br>For all their alertness, they&#x2019;d been completely oblivious to Cole&#x2019;s approach. Not that he expected anything different. He&#x2019;d walked right up beside them, leaning in close to listen. <br>&#x201c;I tell you I saw it,&#x201d; the woman insisted, her voice tinged with awe. &#x201c;I was walking through the lower passages to get a book for Enchanter Garlen, and there it was.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The ghost.&#x201d; The elven boy didn&#x2019;t bother to hide his incredulity. <br>&#x201c;Oh, there can be dragons but not ghosts?&#x201d; Her voice grew indignant. &#x201c;The Chantry doesn&#x2019;t know everything! There are things in the Fade they couldn&#x2019;t possibly begin to&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It could have been a demon.&#x201d; <br>She paused, her face blanching in sudden fear. &#x201c;But&nbsp;&#x2026; it didn&#x2019;t try to speak with me. I don&#x2019;t think it even saw me. I thought maybe it was a visitor, someone who&#x2019;d gotten lost, but when I followed it around the corner it was just gone.&#x201d; <br>The elven boy frowned, his voice lowering to a whisper difficult even for Cole to overhear. &#x201c;You know what they teach us. When a demon comes, it won&#x2019;t seem harmful at first. It&#x2019;ll be something to make you curious, until later when it begins to corrupt you.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>She stared off, her mouth pressing thin with worry. She looked right through Cole, but only a single thought ran through his mind: <i>Did she really see me?</i> <br>The elven boy sighed and hugged her close, murmuring comforting words about how he didn&#x2019;t mean anything by his warning. Maybe she was right. The woman nodded numbly, fighting back tears. &#x201c;What did it look like?&#x201d; he eventually asked. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re humoring me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I want to know. Maybe it was a templar?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think I don&#x2019;t know every templar in the tower by now? Some of them far better than I&#x2019;d like.&#x201d; She touched the bruise on her cheek, and the elven boy scowled but said nothing. &#x201c;No, he wasn&#x2019;t in armor or robes. He was just a man, not much older than you. Shaggy hair, maybe blond? Leathers that looked like they badly needed washing. There have been others who&#x2019;ve seen him, and their descriptions match what I saw.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perhaps he was a laborer working in the tunnels.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When was the last time anyone did work down here?&#x201d; <br>He was at a loss, and shrugged. &#x201c;I know, it&#x2019;s just&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I got close enough to see his eyes.&#x201d; The woman frowned, thinking back. &#x201c;He looked so sad, like he was lost down here. Can you imagine?&#x201d; She shuddered, and the elven boy grinned reassuringly. <br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s the infamous Ghost of the Spire. The others will be so jealous.&#x201d; <br>Her answering smile was faint. &#x201c;We probably shouldn&#x2019;t say anything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Probably not.&#x201d; <br>They stayed there for a while longer, and Cole lingered. He&#x2019;d hoped they might talk some more about what the woman saw, but they didn&#x2019;t. They held hands in the dark and listened to the muted sounds of the chant that floated down from the tower&#x2019;s chapel far above. When the midnight service ended there was nothing left but silence, and the pair reluctantly returned to their chambers. <br>Cole hadn&#x2019;t followed them. Instead he&#x2019;d sat where they sat, letting the silence fill him. He knew he wasn&#x2019;t a demon. He&#x2019;d never seen one before or spoken to one, that he knew of, and unless someone could be a demon and have no inkling of it, that just wasn&#x2019;t possible. A ghost, however? That he wasn&#x2019;t so certain of. <br>He remembered when he first came to the tower. Like every other mage before him, he&#x2019;d arrived in terror, dragged through the halls by a templar&#x2019;s rough hands. He&#x2019;d no idea where this strange place was, or even how long they&#x2019;d traveled to get there. Much of the journey had been spent blindfolded and unconscious, and his unsympathetic captors refused to tell him anything. As far as he&#x2019;d known, they were going to kill him. <br>He remembered being pushed down a dark corridor, empty save for a few apprentices who scurried to get out of the way. Most of them averted their eyes, and that only served to heighten Cole&#x2019;s fear. He was being brought to a dungeon, a black pit from which he was never going to emerge, for his crime of being a mage. The templars called him that word in curt, ugly tones when they needed to call him anything. Mage. Before that day it wasn&#x2019;t a word Cole had associated with himself. It was something he&#x2019;d only heard on the tongues of priests, a watchword for those who had been cursed by the Maker. <br>And now that&#x2019;s what he was. Cursed. <br>They&#x2019;d tossed him into a cell. He&#x2019;d lain there on the damp stone floor, whimpering. He expected a beating but none came. Instead, the cell door had slammed shut with a deafening crash; while Cole was initially relieved, once the men were gone that relief evaporated. They&#x2019;d left him alone in the dark with only the rats for company. The creatures scurried invisibly around him, nipping at him with razor-sharp teeth. He&#x2019;d tried to crawl away from them but there was nowhere to go, nothing to do except curl up into a ball and pray. <br>There in the cold and the nothingness, he&#x2019;d prayed for death. Anything would be better than waiting for the templars to return, anticipating whatever new torment they had planned for him. The priests said demons were drawn to mages, to transform them into terrible abominations&#x2014;but Cole couldn&#x2019;t imagine anything more frightening than the templars themselves. He couldn&#x2019;t shut his eyes enough to block out the memory of their uncaring eyes. <br>He didn&#x2019;t want to be a mage. He didn&#x2019;t want to discover how one became a mage, and found nothing wondrous in the idea of magic. Fervently he prayed to the Maker, over and over again, for deliverance. He prayed until his voice was hoarse, prayed for the templars to forget he even existed. <br>And then he&#x2019;d gotten his wish. That&#x2019;s exactly what they did. <br>Perhaps he&#x2019;d died there in the darkness, and forgotten. Maybe that was how ghosts came to be: they were those who passed on and refused to accept it. Thus they remained, lingering in a life that didn&#x2019;t want them anymore. <br>He shut his eyes tight. <i>Maker above,</i> he thought, <i>if I&#x2019;m dead then give me a sign. Don&#x2019;t you want me at your side, just like the priests all said you would? Don&#x2019;t leave me here.</i> <br>But there was no answer. There never was. <br>If he was dead, why did he still sleep? Why did he still hunger, and breathe, and sweat? These were not things that a dead person did. No matter what they called him, he was no ghost and no demon. <br>But that didn&#x2019;t mean he was real. <br>Up above, the White Spire swarmed with people. There were many levels in the great tower, filled with sunlight and wide spaces. Cole rarely went up there. He was much more comfortable down below, among the things the templars had forgotten as well as the things they <i>wanted</i> forgotten. The bowels of the tower reached deep into the earth, and they were his home. <br>The first few floors of the tower&#x2019;s lower chambers were innocent enough. They contained the kitchen stores, as well as the armories, giant chambers filled with enough equipment and weapons to outfit an army of templars. Beneath that were the archives&#x2014;rooms upon rooms filled with the books they didn&#x2019;t keep in the upper libraries. <br>There were books about magic there, as well as books of music and philosophy, books in forgotten languages, and even the forbidden books they put under lock and key. Normally the archives stood empty, but sometimes Cole would find a mage spending long hours reading by candlelight. He would never understand what they found so interesting about words and pictures. Books were all just old paper to him. <br>Far more interesting were the levels that lay beneath the archives. The oldest part of the tower was called &#x201c;the Pit,&#x201d; and few but Cole ever explored its depths. There were flooded passages down there long ago sealed behind bricks, only to crumble from neglect. Rickety stairwells led to ancient storerooms, some filled with only dust, and others with strange-looking relics. A great mausoleum stood as silent testament to templars who had died centuries ago, faded statues of forgotten heroes towering over marble caskets. He&#x2019;d found hiding places for treasures, the owners of which had long since perished. He&#x2019;d followed dark tunnels that went in circles, or had collapsed, or even led into the city&#x2019;s sewers. Did anyone up above even know about those? <br>He knew every part of the Pit, all save for the area that lay at its heart. The dungeons were there, hundreds and hundreds of cells on multiple levels. More than the templars could ever want, and far more than they used. The oldest were filled with little more than the silent echoes of the tormented, left like indelible imprints in the stone. It made his skin crawl. Cole avoided the dungeons, only going there when he absolutely had to. When he needed to. <br>Like now. <br>Torches weren&#x2019;t used in the dungeons. Instead they put glowstones inside glass lamps, things which flickered like flame but cast a cold and blue light. Magic, he knew, for he could feel the whisper of it caressing his skin as he passed. Even so, only a scant few were used. Just enough for the guards to see their feet. <br>There was one entrance, an intimidating stretch of hall with a vaulted ceiling and multiple iron gates, which could be closed in an instant. Anyone caught within when that happened would be skewered by spikes flying out of dark holes in the walls. Cole shuddered as he walked through. It wasn&#x2019;t the only death trap in the dungeon. The templars would rather have their prisoners die than make it out, and the old scorch marks on the walls told of those who had made the attempt. <br>On the other side of that hallway was a single guard station, a simple room with a small table and a couple of chairs. He saw an open bottle of wine and two half-filled goblets, and plates covered with the cold remnants of the evening meal. A cloak hung on the wall peg, with two dirt-smeared helmets sitting on the floor beneath it. No guards were present, and the inner doors stood wide open. They must be within. <br>Cole hesitantly stepped into the prison. The stench of fear, old and new, immediately assaulted his nostrils. The cells here were used often. How many prisoners might be present now he had no idea, though he knew there was at least one. He heard fearful whimpering farther down the hall. <br>There was laughter, too, along with the idle chatter of two men. Their voices echoed. Cole crept inside until he saw the first hints of blue light ahead. Two armored templars stood in front of an open cell, one holding up a glowlamp. Neither wore a helmet, and thus he recognized them&#x2014;not enough to know their names, for he knew few, but enough to know that these two were merciless hunters, templars who had served their order for so many years that whatever pity they&#x2019;d once been capable of had been ground into dust. <br>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; Lamp Holder cautioned. &#x201c;This one knows how to conjure fire.&#x201d; <br>The other, whom Cole thought of as Big Nose, snorted contemptuously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see her try it.&#x201d; <br>The whimpering came from within the cell. Lamp Holder rolled his eyes and turned away. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t worry. There wasn&#x2019;t much fight left when we caught her. Even less now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Huh. Think she&#x2019;ll make it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Probably better if she didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; The pair exchanged knowing glances as the despairing cries became louder. Big Nose shrugged and slammed the cell door shut, fumbling with a large ring of iron keys until he found the one he wanted. The lock slid into place with an ominous sound. <br>The templars turned and walked toward Cole, whispering to each other. A joke, followed by cruel chuckling. He stayed where he was, nervously holding his breath as they drew close. When they reached him, however, they did what most everyone did: they walked around him, completely oblivious that they&#x2019;d done so. It was never a sure thing, and Cole always half expected that someone might see him. Half hoped, even. <br>The key ring he lifted from Big Nose&#x2019;s belt as he passed. <br>Then they were gone. The glowlamp was gone with them, the only source of light in the prison, and now it was plunged into darkness. Cole slowly let out his breath, waiting for the sound of their footsteps to fade. He could still hear faint weeping behind the cell door. Nearby, water dripped onto stone with a rhythmic <i>tap-tap-tap</i>. Rats squeaked as they emerged from the walls. But he heard nothing in the other cells. If there were prisoners, they were asleep or as good as. <br>He should move. He tried to will his feet into motion, but they were frozen. He felt immaterial, as if he were made of the same substance as the shadows and the first step would cause him to be forever lost in them. The panic rose, and his heart pounded. Sweat poured down his face. <br> <i>Not now,</i> he quailed. <i>Not yet!</i> <br>Cole reached out for the wall. Part of him was fearful his hand would merely pass through, that he would stumble and fall&nbsp;&#x2026; and keep on falling. Down and down he would go, one final scream swallowed by a black oblivion. But his hand touched stone. Blessedly cool stone. He gasped gratefully and pressed his face against it, letting its chill hardness scrape his skin. <br>His breathing slowed. He was shaking, but he was still real. <br> <i>It&#x2019;s not too late.</i> <br>Fumblin...</p><h2>Edwardian House Style: An Architectural and Interior Design Source Book</h2><p>Illustrated throughout with specially commissioned photographs and extensive contemporary source material, this sumptuous volume will enable anyone who wishes to create or preserve period interiors to do so with complete confidence and success.

Tour.</p><p>The popularity of Michael Shaara's wonderful Civil War novel <i>The Killer Angels</i> left many readers hungry for more information about its real-life protagonist, Joshua Chamberlain, who bravely led the 20th Maine in holding the Union's extreme left flank at Little Round Top on the second day of Gettysburg. This dual biography introduces a new figure, nearly as compelling: William Oates, the man who commanded the Alabama troops opposing Chamberlain's bluecoats. Their parallel lives, captured on these pages, reveal the country's 19th-century sectionalism and allow Perry to write a chronicle of the Civil War and its aftermath through the prism of two engaging personalities.<p> Chamberlain's story is fairly well known. He was a Bowdoin College professor who left his post to serve in the army, fought well, and went on to a successful postwar political career as the governor of Maine. Oates, like Chamberlain, was the son of a farmer who got caught up in his nation's defining conflict, and then helped it inch along to recovery years later as a pragmatic governor and member of Congress. Perry refuses to canonize either--Chamberlain was an overbearing husband and Oates stuffed ballot boxes--yet his treatment of these two admirable but flawed men provides a refreshing new way to read about the Civil War. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Focusing on two Civil War heroes who commanded opposing regiments at Gettysburg, this dual biography forges an expansive, dramatic, highly readable history of the generation that came of age during that fateful conflict. Perry, who writes about history and military and foreign affairs (A Fire in Zion: How the Israelis and the Palestinians Made Peace, 1994, etc.), chooses his subjects well. Chamberlain, a devout and introspective Maine college professor, and Oates, a brawling Alabama roustabout, waged the battle for Little Round Top--``the single most important struggle of the single most important battle of America's most important and bloodiest war.'' Despite obvious differences in character, remarkable similarities mark the separate paths that crossed briefly at Gettysburg. Both were self-made men forced by family hardship to provide their own educations; both rode their war records to political office, serving as governors of their respective states; both failed to achieve their highest political ambitions--to serve in the US Senate. The experience of Oates, especially, illustrates the fluctuating fortunes of each side during the long conflict. He fought in nearly every prominent battle of the eastern campaign, from the highs of Stonewall Jackson's stunning Shenandoah Valley victories to the fateful Gettysburg defeat, where his failure to capture Little Round Top is posited as the war's turning point. Perry examines deeply the prevailing trends that shaped the politics of Oates and Chamberlain before the war (a survey that describes the rise of charismatic religion, the beginning of abolitionism, the antebellum movements for women's rights and temperance) and the politics of Reconstruction, which both men helped shape after it. Just when historical sideroads and blow-by-blow battle depictions threaten to swamp readers, Perry veers back to Oates and Chamberlain, the twin Everymen of his satisfying, wide-lens perspective on history.

Whether in youth or adulthood we are always learning, always growing. Jesuit retreat master Peter van Breemen invites us to recognize that amidst the challenges of growing older there is profound beauty and grace. Summoned at Every Age awakens a sense of profound gratitude for the gift of life and beckons us to find our inner center of stillness. Ignatius of Loyola made God&#39;s desire to give us his very self the foundation of his spirituality. In the same way, van Breemen helps us appreciate that God remains with us as we age. Aging is indeed a grace; but it can also be a multifaceted and complex task. This engaging and easy-to-read book will help readers experience both harmony and fruitfulness as they learn to age gracefully with God.</p><p>Peter G van Breemen is the author of several books, including The God Who Won&#39;t Let Go, As Bread That Is Broken, Called by Name, Certain as the Dawn and Let All God&#39;s Glory Through.

Whether a person plays the game of Blackmail, Complain, Robot, or Masquerade depends upon that individual&#x2019;s personality type. Using case examples from her practice as a Marriage and Family Therapist, Dr. Delunas describes the games associated with each of four personality styles and explains the reasons why different types of people are likely to employ game tactics. In addition, she outlines those methods that have been most effective for helping individuals, couples, and families to stop their survival-game-playing.</p><p>Dr. Eve Delunas is a psychotherapist, speaker, and author who worked for over ten years with Dr. David Keirsey, co-author of the best-selling book, Please Understand Me.

He was educated as a medical doctor and psychiatrist, coming under the influence of the Freudian school. In 1910 he began to formulate the concept of psychosynthesis, arguing not that psychoanalysis was an incorrect approach, but that it was incomplete. Since those early days, he has spent his professional life elaborating a generous and comprehensive psychology of man that includes the soul as well the instinctual drives. <br><br>More than a theory, it is also a practical, working method that includes many approaches to personal growth currently entering the mainstreams of psychology and education...meditation, encounter groups, inner-imagery, and several dozen more. These methods are unified around the notion of a self at the core of each individual that can direct the harmonious development of all aspects of the personality. Beyond that personal harmony lies access to higher realism...creativity, transpersonal experience, and spiritual development.</p><p></p><h2>Magic Power of Your Mind</h2><p>Magic powers of your mind</p><p></p><h2>Fric-Frac: The Great Riviera Bank Robbery</h2><p>A singular account of the 1976 &#34;heist of the century&#34; by one of the men who did it.

For devotees as well as for fortunate first readers, here is an exciting, carefully chosen collection of vintage Chandler, much of which has long been difficult to obtain. Included are the complete texts of two of his major Philip Marlowe novels -- The Little Sister and The Long Goodbye, four long short stories, and a self-revelatory essay on his two favorite topics, murder and the English language. Joan Kahn, leading expert on the art of suspense, provides an introduction to Chandler and the particular magic he continues to generate. Two of the stories chosen for inclusion have never before appeared in book form in the United States. These are Chandler&#39;s first published story and his last: &#34;Blackmailers Don&#39;t Shoot,&#34; published in Black Mask in 1933, and &#34;The Pencil,&#34; which appeared shortly after his death in 1959 and was his first short story in twenty years to feature private-eye Marlowe. All of these selections show Chandler as a master stylist and storyteller. His language is vigorous, corrosive, electrifying, glinting with sharp ironies and imaginative aphorisms. &#34;Chandler,&#34; said Malcolm Muggeridge, &#34;very cleverly developed a prose style whose very structure and rhythms are somehow violent. One hears the rat-tat-tat of a sub-machine gun in his sentences.&#34; Meticulously plotted with coiled-spring tension, the novels and stories create the authentic climate of malevolence and danger of the West Coast underworld. What they have in common, besides their sheer readability, is what Chandler himself called &#34;the smell of fear.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Essays in Musical Analysis, Vol. 5: Vocal Music</h2><p>Deft analyses of select masterpieces from the vocal literature by this master of musical analysis.</p><p></p><h2>The Big Bad Wolf</h2><p>From the Publisher &#34;Alex Cross battles the most ruthless and powerful killer he has ever encountered - a predator known only as the Wolf.&#34; &#34;Alex Cross&#39;s first case since joining the FBI has his new colleagues stymied.

One of the most respected woodworkers around digs deeply into the art of crafting and working with this personalized tool, helping even the most uninitiated with dozens of detailed boxed sidebars on the basics. Every step in the construction process receives extremely close attention: preparing the plane blank; bandsaw pointers; drift angle; tension; tuning and using hand tools; sharpening with ease speed, and reliability; cross pin location; and gluing up. Handle the plane well so as to get a good stroke going; and take a look at invaluable planning aids and special techniques.

Finck guides readers through the precision construction of a wood-soled plane that will perform better than today's factory-made, metal-soled counterpart. For the less adventurous, Finck offers comprehensive instructions in the proper use of planes of all types (metal or wooden). Unfortunately, the black-and-white illustrations, while useful, make for a somewhat drab book. Garrett Hack's The Handplane Book (Taunton, 1997) is much more attractive but doesn't cover the construction of one's own planes or appear to be as useful to the average user.

But it's now when Arthur's future should be clearest that he feels the most doubt. Jealousies and greed rive the Crusade, leading him to question its true mission. Back in England, his engagement to Winnie remains uncertain, while his search for his birth mother has been stymied by his vicious father. And his seeing stone shows him the last days of King Arthur's court--a great dream destroyed, but also a glorious legend rising from the ruins. Likewise in this book, Arthur becomes a man worthy of his kingly name.</p><p>Thousands of knights and foot soldiers are mustering in Venice for the launch of the fourth Crusade. Among them in young Arthur de Caldicot, soon to dubbed a knight. He is thrilled to be part of this huge gathering; but all too soon the crusade falls into disarray.<br><br>War, romance, murder, family quarrels, power politics, the conflict between Christianity and Islam: all these are elements in an action-packed story that gives us a startlingly vivid picture of medieval life, enriched by earthy comedy and the magic of the Arthurian legends.Kevin Crossley-Holland was born in 1941 in Mursley, North Buckinghamshire, and grew up in Whiteleaf, a village in the Chiltern Hills of western England. He attended Oxford University, where, after failing his first exams, he developed his passion for Anglo-Saxon literature. After graduating, he was the Gregory Fellow in Poetry at the University of Leeds, and from 1972-1977, he lectured in Anglo-Saxon for the Tufts University of London program. He worked as a children&#x2019;s book editor while beginning to write his own poems and reinterpretations of medieval legends. He has also taught for extended periods in America. He now lives in Norfolk, England.<br><br>Kevin Crossley-Holland has published six volumes of adult poetry and several libretti for opera. In the world of children&#x2019;s books, he is best known for his numerous retellings and anthologies, and in particular his version of Beowolf. Storm, his novella, won the Carnegie Medal in 1985.<br><br>The Seeing Stone, published by Scholastic, is his only other work of original fiction. T.H White is the inevitable comparison for Kevin Crossley-Holland&#x2019;s new novel, American readers will also be reminded of Karen Cushman, for the earthy, rich portrayal of life in a medieval manor. Its sequel, At the Crossing-Places, was published in the United States in fall 2002. The third title in this trilogy is King of the Middle March, which will be published in 2003.<br></p><h2>Shades of Sheol: Death and Afterlife in the Old Testament</h2><p>"For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who can give you praise?" (Psalm 6:5) <ul> <li>Death is a profound and complex subject. How did the Israelites respond to it?</li> <li>The dead apparently went to Sheol. Where and what was it?</li> <li>The inhabitants of Sheol are sometimes called "shades." What does this indicate?</li> <li>Many ancient peoples venerated their ancestors. Did Israelites do this?</li> <li>Did anyone hope for a positive afterlife? If so, in what form?</li> <li>What about resurrection? How and when did this belief emerge?</li> </ul> Philip S. Johnston explores these and other issues. He examines Israelite views on death and afterlife as reflected in the Hebrew Bible and in material remains, and sets them in their cultural, literary and theological contexts. Johnston argues in detail that the Israelites were not as preoccupied with the underworld or the dead as some scholars have recently alleged. Instead, their faith that Yahweh was the God of the living, and that Sheol was cut off from him, led eventually to the hope of a positive afterlife. This important study sheds fresh light on Israelite beliefs in an area central to the later development of the Christian faith.</p><p>Tutor in Old Testament, Wycliffe Hall - Co-editor of The land of promise (Apollos) - Article on &#39;Death and resurrection&#39; in the NDBT (IVP)&#39;This is a competent, comprehensive and accessible study which makes a valuable contribution to an important topic.&#39; Richard Harvey All Nations Christian College</p><h2>Harley Quinn: Welcome to Metropolis</h2><p>Having played out every trick on the fine citizens of Gotham City, Harley Quinn--the Joker's former girlfriend--decides that another city deserves her attention.

Lomax began his career making field recordings of rural music for the Library of Congress and by the late 1930s brought his discoveries to radio, including Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Burl Ives. By the 1940s he was producing concerts that brought white and black performers together, and in the 1950s he set out to record the whole world. <br><br> Lomax was also a controversial figure. When he worked for the U. S. government he was tracked by the FBI, and when he worked in Britain, MI5 continued the surveillance. In his last years he turned to digital media and developed technology that anticipated today's breakthroughs. Featuring a cast of characters including Eleanor Roosevelt, Leadbelly, Carl Sandburg, Carl Sagan, Jelly Roll Morton, Muddy Waters, and Bob Dylan, Szwed's fascinating biography memorably captures Lomax and provides a definitive account of an era as seen through the life of one extraordinary man.</p><p><b>John Szwed</b> is the author of <i>So What: The Life of Miles Davis</i> and <i>Space Is the Place: The Life and Times of Sun Ra</i>, among other works. He is a professor of music and jazz studies at Columbia University. He lives in New York City.*Starred Review* The scope of Alan Lomax&#x2019;s protean and profoundly influential life&#x2019;s work grants him the designations folklorist, musicologist, oral historian, photographer, filmmaker, recording and concert producer, anthropologist, archivist, activist, and author. But even this litany barely covers Lomax&#x2019;s pioneering documentation of music born of pain and injustice, his crossing racial lines in the segregated South to collect African American songs, and his bringing folk music into the mainstream. Szwed, a biographer of Miles Davis and professor of music and jazz studies at Columbia University, gamely charts Lomax&#x2019;s itinerant, messianic, world-changing endeavors, beginning with his start as his folk-music-collecting father&#x2019;s assistant and on to his myriad inventive and demanding ethnomusicology projects, his barely surviving on grants and Library of Congress stipends, his run-ins with the FBI and embroilment in controversies, and his continual self-reinvention. Here are the full stories of Lomax&#x2019;s pivotal relationships with Zora Neale Hurston, Lead Belly, Jelly Roll Morton, Pete Seeger, and Margaret Mead. Factually tireless and fluently analytical, Szwed gamely corrals a great river of events, efforts, and discoveries into a straight-ahead portrait of an intrepid, culture-defining artist and humanist. Driven by a voracious hunger for life and unshakable faith in art, Lomax forever sought the &#x201c;flame of beauty.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Grace: A Christmas Sisters of the Heart Novel (Sisters of the Heart, 4)</h2><p><p>A Christmas Sisters of the Heart novel, <em>Grace </em>by Shelly Shepard Gray brings back the beloved characters from her popular series of inspirational novels set in a tightly knit Amish community.

Tour.</p><p><b>Nancy Mowll Mathews</b> is the Eug�nie Prendergast Curator at Williams College Museum of Art.Brilliant, lively life of long-lived American Impressionist painter Mary Cassatt (1844-1926), by the editor of her selected letters and author of a monograph on her (neither reviewed here). Mathews's historical considerations of Cassatt, showing how the painter has fared with art critics and feminist writers through the decades since her entries were first accepted by the Paris Salon in 1872, reveal just how surreal public and critical understanding of a painter can be, with Cassatt seen in the guises of a half-dozen different roles--from Victorian spinster to torch- bearing feminist--and each rippling image seen as the real woman. Trained in Pennsylvania and the Paris atelier of Charles Chaplin, Cassatt made an early decision never to accept a marriage proposal, preferring the life of the artist to that of the wife; nor, apparently, did she ever enter into a lesbian tie, though these were not uncommon among French painters. Cassatt was early recognized for her forceful opinions and the intense intellectual stimulation of her company. She led a romantic, nomadic life in France until turning professional and taking up her own studio in Paris. She welcomed the invitation by Degas to join the Impressionists and, though she met few of the outstanding members of that group, enjoyed matching wits with the fast tongues of those she did meet. Cassatt gave up her earlier melancholy, yearning, and contemplative subject matter for the modern psychological depth of Degas and Manet. With the waning of the Impressionists a decade later, she came into her prime and brought an abstract originality to her sensuous compositions of mothers and children. Her taste influenced many major American art collections, though cataracts deprived her of sight during her final years. Quiet but uplifting.

The great effort to survey a transcontinental railway route across the 38th parallel ended short of success in the snows of Utah in 1854 but involved a meticulous photographic documentation-in daguerreotypes-of the route from the Mississippi westward. It was believed that a central railroad across the country would favor abolitionists in the great debate then raging in the country over slavery. Solomon Nunes Carvalho was hired by Frmont to photograph the expedition-the first time a western expeditionary survey had been systematically documented in photographs. Tragically, the daguerreotypes were destroyed by fire, and Frmont&#39;s fifth expedition was lost to history. Author and daguerreotypist Robert Shlaer remarkably has reconstructed the expedition in 120 original daguerreotypes. Using Frmont&#39;s maps, expedition documents, and Carvalho&#39;s diary accounts, Shlaer recreates the lost expedition across America&#39;s most breathtaking landscape using photography&#39;s first and most venerable method of daguerreotypy.</p><p>Robert Shlaer is a master of the contemporary daguerreotype and a recognized authority on daguerreotype methods and history. He is a research associate at the Palace of the Governors, Museum of New Mexico.Shlaer created this fascinating and uncommon work after becoming intrigued by the record of the last expedition of famous explorer John Fr?mont across the Rockies and by the story of the daguerreotypist who accompanied Fr?mont, a Jewish photographer named Solomon Carvalho. Unfortunately, Carvalho's daguerreotypes of the expedition were destroyed in a fire after the trip. Shlaer, an accomplished modern daguerreotypist, decided to re-create those lost daguerreotypes by retracing Fr?mont's route and taking daguerreotypes at the same places Carvalho had, as best he could determine from existing knowledge. The book is very visually attractive, reproducing Shlaer's daguerreotypes along with engravings from contemporary reports on the expedition. However, Andrew Rolle's John Charles Fr?mont: Character as Destiny (LJ 11/1/91) would still serve well as a title on Fr?mont, and Carvalho's career will be covered in Arlene Hirschfelder's forthcoming Photo Odyssey: Solomon Carvalho's Remarkable Western Adventure, 1853-54 (Clarion, 2000). Shlaer's rather esoteric book is recommended only for history of photography or substantial Western exploration collections.<br><i>-Charles V.

A fond introduction by Tom Hanks opens the book, but its multifaceted pleasures spring from the love of author Maria Cooper Janis, who clearly felt it was a unique and great privilege to be the daughter of Gary Cooper. Janis's writing--from the loving letter to her father's ghost to the text that accompanies the many photographs--is charged with filial warmth.<p> Though the book offers many glimpses of Cooper on the set, it also sheds light on sides of the actor that never appeared on screen: the family man, the sportsman, the host and guest who opened his affections to many Hollywood luminaries. It is these photographs that really make the book a delight. The camera has loved very few men as much as it did Cooper, and this collection captures the ease and joy of an American icon who in films often played awkward and alienated figures. Page after page of extraordinary black-and-white shots reveal the warm relationships Cooper had with his family, and with friends like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Jimmy Stewart. This volume offers a tender view into a rare and fading kind of celebrity life, one that appears to have been somehow both glamorous and private. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p>Gary Cooper (1901-1961) is an American icon-an actor whose handsome features and unstudied poise made him one of the great stars of Hollywood's Golden Era.

Illustrated throughout with 175 photographs, including many never-before-published family pictures, Maria Cooper Janis' heartfelt book offers an unprecedented look at her father's private side, from his Montana boyhood and his Hollywood home life to his friendships with Ernest Heming way, Pablo Picasso, and Jimmy Stewart, among others.

Each was the same as the other.&#x201d; Aziz, an Afghan boy at the beginning of the novel, has lost nearly everything: Taliban forces killed his parents, and his older brother is left crippled when U.S. forces clash with militant ones. Alone, in need of money and seeking revenge, he enlists in the Special Lashkar, a militia funded by Americans to fight local insurgents. Aziz rises through the ranks, learns to kill, and discovers the nefarious profiteering, oppression and cultural beliefs that contrive this never ending war. A decorated Afghan and Iraq war veteran, Elliot Ackerman&#x2019;s empathetic portrayal of individuals, factions, and the reasons they fight is fierce and haunting. With crisp, uncompromising prose, <i>Green on Blue</i> joins the canon of contemporary war literature and leaves you breathless. &#x2013; <i>Al Woodworth</i></p> <p><b>Review of Elliot Ackerman's <i>Green on Blue</i> by <i>Ben Fountain</i></b></p> <p><strong>Photo credit: Thorne Anderson</strong></p> <p><strong>Photo credit: Peter Van Agtmael</strong></p> <p>"The militants fought to protect us from the Americans," says Aziz, the young Afghan narrator of <i>Green on Blue,</i> "and the Americans fought to protect us from the militants, and being so protected, life was very dangerous." Aziz would know better than many: first he loses his parents and his home to the war, then his cherished older brother is left permanently disabled by a bombing, a chain of events that leads Aziz to join the Special Lashkar, an indigenous army sponsored by the Americans to combat insurgents in the Afghan countryside. And so begins Aziz&#x2019;s life as a soldier in a savage, complex war where the requisites of <i>nang</i> and <i>badal</i> honor and revenge, sometimes serve, and at other times clash with, the larger goals of the Americans and their Afghan allies and enemies. </p> <p> War: one could do worse than define it as the collision of chaos theory with the law of unintended consequences. Aziz discovers that what he wants from the war isn&#x2019;t nearly so simple and pure as it once seemed, and indeed, the war itself is gradually revealed to be <i>ghabban,</i> a racket, with the blond-haired, blue-eyed American soldier &#x201c;Mr. Jack&#x201d; providing the money and arms that keep the whole bloody business going. &#x201c;Some wars only feed themselves,&#x201d; says Atal, the sometime enemy, sometime ally of Aziz. &#x201c;They cannot be won, only starved.&#x201d; </p> <p>If we want to understand anything about this war we&#x2019;ve been fighting for thirteen years--a war that keeps spinning off greater and greater chaos, and more black consequence than even the most cynical pacifist might have predicted--then Ackerman&#x2019;s unflinching novel is an excellent place to start. Part of the genius of this book is the sheer power of the storytelling, thanks to the immersive effect of Aziz&#x2019;s voice and the keenness with which he observes and ponders all that comes his way. What we witness in Aziz is the wisdom of the survivor: clear-eyed, stony, unsparing. But perhaps the greater part of this novel&#x2019;s genius lies in the grinding, almost inevitable logic of Aziz&#x2019;s ultimate act, the fatal "green on blue" of the title. How could he do otherwise in a war with "no cause . . . at least none larger than oneself?" All the politicians&#x2019; cheerleading of the past thirteen years, the p.r., the fine and pious phrases that seek to sanitize the shedding of more and more blood, are shown for the fraud they are by the truths of Elliot Ackerman&#x2019;s extraordinary novel. </p>Elliot Ackerman&nbsp;served five tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and is the recipient of the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for Valor, and the Purple Heart.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Includes the 50th anniversary fully corrected text setting and an extensive new index"An extraordinary work -- pure excitement." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them <br>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others.

Kennedy. Volume 5 chronicles the approach of Merton&#x2019;s fiftieth birthday and marks his move to Mount Olivet, his hermitage at the Abbey of Gethsemani, where he was finally able to fully embrace the joys and challenges of solitary life: &#x2018;In the hermitage, one must pray of go to seed. The pretense of prayer will not suffice. Just sitting will not suffice . . . Solitude puts you with your back to the wall (or your face to it!), and this is good&#x2019; (13 October, 1964).</p></p><p><i>"Inexorably life moves on towards crisis and mystery. Everyone must struggle to adjust himself to this, to face the situation for 'now is the judgment of the world.' In a way, each one judges himself merely by what he does. Does, not says. Yet let us not completely dismiss words. They do have meaning. They are related to action. They spring from action and they prepare for it, they clarify it, they direct it." --</i>Thomas Merton<i>, </i>August 16, 1961 <p> The fourth volume of Thomas Merton's complete journals, one of his final literary legacies, springs from three hundred handwritten pages that capture - in candid, lively, deeply revealing passages - the growing unrest of the 1960s, which Merton witnessed within himself as plainly as in the changing culture around him. </p><p> In these decisive years, 1960-1963, Merton, now in his late forties and frequently working in a new hermitage at the Abbey of Gethsemani, finds himself struggling between his longing for a private, spiritual life and the irresistible pull of social concerns. Precisely when he longs for more solitude, and convinces himself he could not cut back on his writing, Merton begins asking complex questions about the contemporary culture ("the 'world' with its funny pants, of which I do not know the name, its sandals and sunglasses"), war, and the churches role in society. </p><p> Thus despite his resistance, he is drawn into the world where his celebrity and growing concerns for social issues fuel his writings on civil rights, nonviolence, and pacifism and lead him into conflict with those who urge him to leave the moral issues to bishops and theologians. </p><p> This pivotal volume in the Merton journals reveals a man at the height of a brilliant writing career, marking the fourteenth anniversary of his priesthood but yearning still for the key to true happiness and grace. Here, in his most private diaries, Merton is as intellectually curious, critical, and insightful as in his best-known public writings while he documents his movement from the cloister toward the world, from Novice Master to hermit, from ironic critic to joyous witness to the mystery of God's plan. </p><p> Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk, writer and peace activist. His spiritual classics include <i>New Seeds of Contemplation, The Sign of Jonas, Mystics and Zen Masters</i> and <i>The Seven Story Mountain</i> </p><p></p>In the fifth volume of Thomas Merton&#39;s acclaimed journals, the renowned monk and writer immerses himself in the revolutionary ideas of the sixties and finally begins to live full-time at his own hermitage.</p><h2>SEAROAD: Chronicles of Klatsand</h2><p>A tale by the author of the Earthsea trilogy portrays the triumphs and struggles of several generations of women who independently control Klatsand, a small resort town on the Oregon coast.

Now, in a brilliant series of essays written over the last three years, Johnson measures that price and the resulting dangers America faces. Our reliance on Pentagon economics, a global empire of bases, and war without end is, he declares, nothing short of "a suicide option." </p><p><i>Dismantling the Empire</i> explores the subjects for which Johnson is now famous, from the origins of blowback to Barack Obama's Afghanistan conundrum, including our inept spies, our bad behavior in other countries, our ill-fought wars, and our capitulation to a military that has taken ever more control of the federal budget. There is, he proposes, only one way out: President Obama must begin to dismantle the empire before the Pentagon dismantles the American Dream. If we do not learn from the fates of past empires, he suggests, our decline and fall are foreordained. This is Johnson at his best: delivering both a warning and an urgent prescription for a remedy. </p></p><p>In Blowback, published before 9/11, Johnson warned that our secret operations in Iraq and elsewhere around the globe would exact a price at home.

Published as a reply to Burke&#39;s Reflections on the Revolution in France, it differs from that great work in every relevant respect. Where Burke uses the language of the governing classes, Paine writes with the vigour of a self-taught mast-maker and exciseman. With passionate and rapier wit, Paine challenges Burke&#39;s assertion that society cannot be judged by rational standards and found wanting. Rights of Man contains a fully-costed budget, advocating measures such as free education, old age pensions, welfare benefits and child allowance over 100 years before these things were introduced in Britain. It remains a compelling manifesto for social change.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.No individual&#39;s writing better exemplifies this transformation of the language of social and political change than that of Thomas Paine (1737-1809). And no individual has a better claim to be the world&#39;s first international revolutionary. His writings bear witness to his revolutionary activities, and provide us with a detailed picture of the evolving understanding of social and political change at the end of the eighteenth century.</p><h2>For Esme-With Love and Squalor, and Other Stories</h2><p>A collection of nine exceptional stories from the much-loved author of The Catcher in the RyeAn American soldier has a strange encounter with an orphaned English teenager the night before he leaves for war. A four-year-old boy runs away in a dinghy; a missionary&#39;s child is kidnapped by Chinese bandits. A honeymoon in Florida goes awry with tragic consequences. Including the first stories to feature Salinger&#39;s beloved Glass family characters, this brilliantly varied collection offers a vivid introduction to the work of one of the most admired and widely read American novelists of the twentieth century. Witty, urbane and frequently affecting, For Esme - with Love and Squalor sits alongside Salinger&#39;s very best work - a gem that will be passed down for many generations to come.</p><p>J.D. Salinger was born in 1919 and died in January 2010. He grew up in New York City, and wrote short stories from an early age, but his breakthrough came in 1948 with the publication in the New Yorker of &#39;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&#39;. The Catcher in the Rye was his first and only novel, published in 1951. It remains one of the most translated, taught and reprinted texts, and has sold some 65 million copies. Salinger also wrote several novellas and short stories, including Franny and Zooey, For Esme - With Love and Squalor, and Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction.</p><h2>Until the Final Hour: Hitler&#39;s Last Secretary</h2><p>Offering a unique insider&#39;s perspective on Adolf Hitler and the final days of the Third Reich, the personal recollections of a woman who became Hitler&#39;s secretary at the age of twenty-two in 1942 sheds new light on Hitler&#39;s day-to-day life, character, and habits, while chronicling a young woman&#39;s discovery of the evil that lurked behind the pleasant fa�ade of the man for whom she worked. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Like her infamous employer, author Junge struggled with unfulfilled artistic dreams: she traveled to Berlin in 1942 to pursue a career as a dancer and ended up taking dictation for Adolf Hitler. "There were very few days when I didn&#x2019;t see Hitler, talk to him, work with him or share meals with him," she remembers. Junge&#x2019;s account, undoubtedly a primer on the so-called "banality of evil," is a detailed, efficient and humorless memoir of the three years she spent as Hitler&#x2019;s secretary. Her tale&#x2014;full of trivial tidbits and, often interchangeably, chilling observations&#x2014;draws a picture of a man at once astonishingly uninspired, quixotic and devoted to his cause. It also documents how the Fuhrer served as a father figure to Junge, whose own parents were divorced. She reveals that her post-war disdain for Hitler resembled that of an abandoned child: she hated him after his death, she says, "for his failures." This moral equivocation may seem disturbing in hindsight, but the irony of Junge&#x2019;s proximity to Hitler was that she was all but shielded from the heinous realities of the war. The most compelling part of this memoir comes near the end when, upon escaping Berlin after the Allied advance in 1945, Junge makes her way from village to village, encountering the remnants of battles. This picture of a fugitive literally running away from herself suggests why Junge, unable to fully accept the nature of her complicity with the Reich, took 30 years to write her story; it also proves far more interesting than learning what Hitler ate for breakfast. 15 photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"It has been 'God and I' the whole way," Smedes writes. "Not so much because he has always been pleasant company. Not because I could always feel his presence when I got up in the morning or when I was afraid to sleep at night. It was because he did not trust me to travel alone."<br><br>Yet <em>My God and I</em> is more than Smedes's personal account of his travels with God -- the theological odyssey that was his life. Like all his writings, this book also models and instructs. Through his honest confessions on the nature of Christian faith, Smedes offers gentle insights not just about God but also about human life and how it can and should be lived. And for those interested in the particulars of Smedes's professional life, these pages include many anecdotes by one whose career was linked closely with shifting currents in modern theology and with some of America's premier educational institutions.<br><br>Above all, <em>My God and I</em> will provide a source of spiritual comfort to those who, like Smedes, continue to strive after the presence of God. It will also be a cherished good-bye for the many people who have been touched by the wisdom, wit, and charm of Lewis Smedes.</p><p>(1921&#x2013;2002) Was professor emeritus of theology and ethics at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California. Among his many books are <em>Forgive and Forget</em>, <em>Shame and Grace</em>, <em>How Can It Be All Right When Everything Is All Wrong?</em>, <em>Love within Limits</em>, and <em>Mere Morality</em>.Shortly after completing the manuscript for this book last fall, Smedes fell from a ladder and died; he was 81. Professor emeritus of theology and ethics at Fuller Seminary and author of more than a dozen books, he is perhaps best known for his 1984 title Forgive and Forget, still in print with nearly a million copies sold. Here he turns from ethics to intensely personal reflection. Sparing neither himself nor those whose theology he finds inadequate, he connects the highlights of his life to his developing theological understanding and quest for personal faith. Smedes describes what turned out to be his last book as "neither a collection of essays about God nor a story of my life, but an account of my doubts and my pains, my faith and my hope as I walked with my elusive God down the winding trail from there to here." That trail, beginning on his grandfather's peat farm in the Netherlands, included poverty, bereavement and shame; but as he walked it, it was increasingly marked by love, self-acceptance and gratitude: "Personally I liked the last miles of the journey better than the first. But, since I could not have the ending without first having the beginning, I thank God for getting me going and bringing me home." Humbly recounted and gracefully written, this slim volume is a pleasure to read and a poignant valediction from a man who lived long and loved wisdom. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn (Wheeler Large Print Book Series)</h2><p><p>Little Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custer's Last Stand, the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands like Thermopylae and the Alamo. With a tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches the two larger than life antagonists in a mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West.</p></p><p>Nathaniel Philbrick, is a leading authority on the history of Nantucket Island. His <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> won the National Book Award. His latest book is <i>Sea of Glory</i>, about the epic U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838&#x2013;1842. His other books include <i>Away off Shore: Nantucket Island and Its People, 1602-1890</i> (which <i>Russell Baker</i> called "indispensable") and <i>Abram's Eyes: The Native American Legend of Nantucket Island</i> ("a classic of historical truthtelling," according to <i>Stuart Frank</i>, director of the Kendall Whaling Museum). He has written an introduction to a new edition of <i>Joseph Hart</i>'s <i>Miriam Coffin, or The Whale Fisherman</i>, a Nantucket novel (first published in 1834) that <i>Melville</i> relied upon for information about the island when writing <i>Moby Dick</i>. <p> Philbrick, a champion sailboat racer, has also written extensively about sailing, including <i>The Passionate Sailor</i> (1987) and the forthcoming <i>Second Wind: A Sunfish Sailor's Odyssey</i>. He was editor in chief of the classic <i>Yaahting: A Parody</i> (1984). </p><p> In his role as director of the Egan Institute of Maritime Studies, Philbrick, who is also a research fellow at the Nantucket Historical Association, gives frequent talks about Nantucket and sailing. He has appeared on "NBC Today Weekend", A&amp;E's "Biography" series, and National Public Radio and has served as a consultant for the movie "Moby Dick", shown on the USA Network. He received a bachelor of Arts from Brown University and a Master of Arts in American Literature from Duke. He lives on Natucket with his wife and two children. </p><p> </p> <p> </p>Nathaniel Philbrick brings a sailor&#39;s eye and an extraordinary knowledge of nineteenth-century maritime life to the landlocked tragedy of Custer and Sitting Bull. It&#39;s hard to miss the parallels between Custer&#39;s fate and that of the sailors on the ill-fated whaling ship ESSEX, as recounted in Philbrick&#39;s notable IN THE HEART OF THE SEA. In THE LAST STAND, the polyglot army on the alien plains acts and drinks like the crew of a whaling ship. Philbrick sorts through the extensive and often-contradictory evidence of what happened at the Little Bighorn. Much of his narrative focuses on accounts of the battle. George Guidall provides an avuncular delivery as he tells the long and complicated story in a gruff, clear, and unhurried voice. Understanding what happened at the Little Bighorn requires a map.

Can spirituality be integrated with science? Is happiness possible? Do miracles really happen? Not only does <i>The Visionary Window</i> answer " yes" to all of these questions, but it skillfully combines the fields of philosophy, cosmology, religion, and psychology to form a new way of thinking about science and spirituality. Stepping beyond the classic work of prominent seventies physicist Fritjof Capra, Goswami details his own pioneering exploration of science and spirit, revealing the complete integration between modern science and spiritual traditions. Using stories and colorful examples from pop culture, Goswami addresses complex issues in language and terminology easily accessible to the lay reader. He provides quantum physics-based theory and new experimental data verifying the metaphysical truth that exists when employed in the context of a new science, science within the primacy of consciousness. With a new holistic worldview, Goswami also discusses the creativity of the body to self heal; the power of spiritual practice and how to choose a meditative path; and the five stages of spiritual growth, culminating in the ability to transcend the physical laws of nature. Readers, scientists and spiritual leaders alike will find answers to many of life's deepest mysteries.</p><p><b>Amit Goswami, Ph.D.</b>, was born in India and raised in the Hindu tradition. He earned his Ph.D. from Calcutta University in theoretical nuclear physics in 1964 and is professor emeritus in the physics department at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon, where he has served since 1968. He taught physics for 32 years in this country, mostly in Oregon, before fully retiring in 2003. Goswami was a senior scholar in residence at the Institute of Noetic Sciences during 1998-2000. He teaches quite regularly at the Holmes Institute and the Philosophical Research University in L.A.; Pacifica in Santa Barbara, CA; and UNIPAZ in Portugal. Goswami is a pioneer of the new multidisciplinary paradigm of science based on the primacy of consciousness called "Science within Consciousness," as well as the author of the highly successful textbook, <i>Quantum Mechanics</i>. His two-volume textbook for nonscientists, <i>The Physicist's View of Nature</i>, traces the decline and rediscovery of the concept of God within science. His research has been published in scientific journals in three different fields: physics, biology, and psychology. Goswami has also written eight popular books based on his research on quantum physics and consciousness. In his seminal book, <i>The Self-Aware Universe</i>, he solved the quantum measurement problem elucidating the famous observer effect while paving the path to a new paradigm of science based on the primacy of consciousness. Subsequently, in <i>The Visionary Window</i>, Goswami demonstrates how science and spirituality can be integrated. In <i>Physics of the Soul</i>, he developed a theory of survival after death and reincarnation. His book <i>Quantum Creativity</i> is a tour de force instruction about how to engage in both outer and inner creativity. Goswami's last book, <i>The Quantum Doctor</i>, integrates conventional and alternative medicines. In his private life, Goswami is a practitioner of spirituality and transformation. He refers to himself as a "quantum activist." The public knows Goswami perhaps the best since his leading role in the hit independent film, "What the Bleep Do We Know!?". He has also appeared on numerous radio talk shows, including "New Dimensions" and "Thinking Allowed". Goswami currently resides in Eugene, Oregon.</p><h2>Karelia - A Finnish-American Couple in Stalin&#39;s Russia, 1934 - 1941</h2><p>In 1934 Russia invited many Finnish-American couples to accept jobs in Karelia, Russia.

Included are instructions for Victorian lace as the Victorians never saw it&#x2014;in glorious detail, up-close and on location in and around Cambridge, England.&nbsp;The lace patterns progress from the first, most basic, edgings to the sophistication of "real" lace.&nbsp;Forty patterns are included&#x2014;scarves and shawls, capes, and fichus&#x2014;with comprehensive information on the tools and techniques of lace knitting&nbsp;for beginners and enough challenges to keep experienced&nbsp;or ambitious knitters engaged.

He lives in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.April 08 This wonderful book has now been published in paperback and if you are a fan of lace knitting and have not yet seen it, it is a must for your bookshelf. The author has a passion for lace and the Victorian women who pioneered the first published knitting patterns. There are 40 patterns in the book for beautiful lace shawls and scarves that have been inspired or recreated from these vintage patterns. The book begins with a brief exploration of Victorian knitting books and chapters based on the patterns several nineteenth century tomes. The patterns provided are for a variety of levels from the enthusiastic first-time knitter to the experienced with simple but effective starter projects to the mind-bogglingly challenging. There are clear explanation and charts to accompany each one and there is a full technique library which covers a variety of cast-ons, stitch manoeuvres and borders. The entire book is sumptuously photographed with a fascinating chapter on Jane&#39;s researches and production of Victorian Lace Today. If you have ever been remotely tempted to try lace then this book is an excellent companion; the author describes herself as a &#39;normal&#39; knitter before embarking on her research and with &#34;curiosity and determination&#34; has created this beautiful collection of lace shawls you see in the book. * Knit Today * Jan 07 A decade in the making, this elegant book harks back to the 1800s, when knitting for pleasure took wing and the first wave of knitting authors made a name for itself. Those pioneers - Misses Watts, Hope and Lambert, Mrs Gaugain - are revered and revitalized by Sowerby, who updates their gorgeous designs, along with those in the &#39;Weldon&#39;s Practical Knitter&#39; volumes, to work with today&#39;s fibers and sensibilities. Shot on grand location at the English estate used in the BBC&#39;s Pride and Prejudice, as well as on the bridges of Cambridge and at stately museums, the photos byn Alexis Xenakis do complete justice to the beauty and intricacy of the lace. If you&#39;re a lace knitter, get one copy for the coffee table and another to dog-ear your way through. * Yarn Market News * Feb 08 Did you know that Queen Victoria was a keen knitter? Have you ever wanted to knit a 150-year-old pattern but now known where to start? This excellent book addresses both questions, tracing the history of how lace-making evolved from the 1830s to the 1900s and updating Victorian patterns for the modern knitter. As part of her research on the subject, author Jane Sowerby has gathered together many original Victorian patterns, and then given them a clever modern update by adapting them for today&#39;s yarns and colours. The result is a very successful collection which includes flowing shawls and delicate scarves as well as some more unusual designs. It also caters to all skill levels, so even if you&#39;re new to lace you&#39;ll find something simple and stunning to start on. This book is also beautiful to look at and includes many great location shots taken in and around Cambridge. The gorgeous photos show off Jane&#39;s designs against some wonderful backdrops. The stunning design of the book itself combined with the wealth of historical details and the gorgeous patterns makes this an ideal coffee table book for the keen knitter. It would also make an excellent gift for a special knitting friend - we&#39;re adding to to our wish lists! * Simply Knitting * Jan 07 A decade in the making, this elegant book harks back to the 1800s, when knitting for pleasure took wing and the first wave of knitting authors made a name for itself.

It might even be described as a photographer&#39;s ego trip, were the photographer not Alexis Xenakis, the editor of Knitter&#39;s magazine and a man with a lot of experience of illustrating knitting. As an American he seems simply to be revelling in the UK&#39;s architectural heritage whilst on a trip to illustrate Jane Sowerby&#39;s amazing collection of knitted lace and her research into Victorian lace knitters and designer. For me though, that is the problem with a book that I shall no doubt buy, but which I find is set out in a way that I do not immediately follow. Yes, each pattern has a schematic of the finished shape, details of the tension, the materials (in generic yarn type as well as commercial brands) and charted stitch patterns and the instructions are written out at the start. Despite this information, there is nothing that shows where each of the charts appears on the final version. I would have liked something like &#39;the body of this triangular shawl is worked from the point to the wide edge and the border is then added to all three sides&#39;. I also found the habit of putting some quotes from Victorian authors in quotation marks but others indented and in an italic font (the book uses a sans serif font so that italic type does not show up very clearly) irritating. But perhaps the greatest omission in a work that contains so much research is the lack of an index to anything but the projects and the photographic locations. There is no bibliography either. However, as a visual delight, this book is at least the equal of any other knitting book that I have ever seen and it stands alone because of the historical research and enormous collection of beautifully knitted and immaculately presented knitting.

The oral interview is the most important part of the hiring process. Since it is often weighted 100% of the candidate s final score, earning a high score on the interview is essential to getting hired. Fire department oral interviews are unique, which is why most people struggle with them. Successful candidates understand exactly what the raters are looking for in an entry-level candidate. Those who don t may struggle for years, eventually giving up on their dreams. Chief Lepore has proctored hundreds of entry-level interviews. He was amazed at how unprepared most candidate were. He could see that many had the will and desire, but it was very apparent that the vast majority of candidates were ill-prepared for the oral interview. His objective is to show the candidate the interview through the eyes of the raters. The more a candidate understands what the oral board is looking for, the more he or she will be able to present as the candidate they have been waiting for. Smoke Your Firefighter Interview is packed with 330 pages of invaluable information. Chief Lepore covers 85 of the most commonly asked fire department interview questions. The format is simple: question, answer, and reasoning behind the answer. After answering each question, Chief Lepore carefully and thoroughly explains why he has answered the question the way he did. These reasons often delve into the culture of the fire department and the expectations of a rookie firefighter. In short, anyone can memorize questions and answers. Smoke Your Firefighter Interview explains why the answers are correct. In addition to the questions and answers, Chief Lepore explains the rationale for WHY he answers the question the way he does. He includes many follow-up questions as well as explaining the pit falls for many of the questions. Once a candidate understands the interview process and learns how to present his or her answers, it is not uncommon to get multiple job offers. Instead of struggling to land a job, many candidates are blessed with the ability to select from several departments. Getting hired on the fire department is all about learning to take a fire department interview. Those who learn will be successful, while those who don t will always struggle. A candidate may be exactly what a fire department is looking for, but if he or she cannot interview favorably, he or she will never get hired. In addition to 85 questions, answers and rationale for the right answers, Smoke Your Firefighter Interview also includes chapters on: Rules of thumb for handling situational questions What to expect from your first day as a firefighter Sample interview rating sheets Description of the job of a firefighter Monthly probationary evaluations</p><p>Paul Lepore is a Battalion Chief with the City of Long Beach, California Fire Department.

Filled with compelling&nbsp;&nbsp;drama, earthy humor, and remarkable insight,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Palace Of Desire</i> is the unforgettable&nbsp;&nbsp;story of the violent clash between ideals and&nbsp;&nbsp;realities, dreams and desires.</p><p>Naguib Mahfouz was most prominent literary figure in the Arab world of the Twentieth Century, best known for his Cairo Trilogy (Palace Walk, Palace of Desire and Sugar Walk), which became an international bestseller. He was born in Cairo in 1911 and lived in the suburb of Agouza with his wife and two daughters for the rest of his life. He published more than thirty novels as well as many collections of short stories, plays and screenplays. In 1988, Mr Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first Arab writer to win it. In 1994, after the publication of a novel that led him into trouble with Egypt&#39;s religious authorities, an attempt was made on his life, but he died peacefully in 2006, aged 94.1<br><br>AL-SAYYID AHMAD Abd al-Jawad closed the door behind him and crossed the courtyard of his house by the pale light of the stars. His step was lethargic, and his walking stick sank into the dusty earth whenever he leaned on it wearily. He felt on fire and craved cold water so he could wash his face, head, and neck and escape, if only briefly, from the July heat and from the inferno in his belly and head. Cheered by the thought of cool water, he smiled. When he entered the door leading to the stairway, he could see a faint light coming from above. It flowed along the wall, revealing the motion of the hand that held the lamp. He climbed the steps with one hand on the railing and the other on his stick. Its successive taps had long ago acquired a special rhythm, which identified him as easily as his features. Amina was visible at the head of the stairs with the lamp in her hand. On reaching her, he stopped to regain his breath, for his chest was heaving. Then he greeted her in his customary way: "Good evening."<br><br>Preceding him with the lamp, Amina murmured, "Good evening, sir."<br><br>Once inside his room he rushed to the sofa and collapsed. Letting go of his stick and taking off his fez, he threw his head back and stretched out his legs. The sides of his cloak fell open, and the caftan underneath rode up to reveal the legs of his long underwear tucked into his socks. He shut his eyes and wiped his forehead, cheeks, and neck with a handkerchief.<br><br>After placing the lamp on a table, Amina waited for him to rise so she could help remove his clothes. She looked at him with anxious concern. She wished she had the courage to ask him not to stay out so late &#x2014; now that his health could no longer shrug off excesses &#x2014; but she did not know how to express her sad thoughts. <br><br>A few minutes passed before he opened his eyes. Then he extracted the gold watch from his caftan and took off his diamond ring to place them both in his fez. When he stood up to remove his cloak and caftan with Amina's assistance, his body seemed as tall, broad, and full as ever, although the hair at his temples had been assailed by gray. When he was putting his head in the neck of his white house shirt, a smile suddenly go the better of him. He remember how Mr. Ali Abd al-Rahim had vomited at their party that evening and had apologized for his weakness, attributing it to an upset stomach. They had all singled out their friend, upbraiding him and asserting that he could no longer tolerate alcohol, for only a special kind of man could keep on drinking to the end of his life, and so forth. He remembered he anger and vehemence of Mr. Ali in defending himself against this suspicion. How amazing that some people lent importance to such trivial matters. . . . But if it were not important, then why had he himself boasted in the merry hubbub that he could drink a whole tavern of wine without ill effects?<br><br>He sat down again and lifted his feet so that his wife could take off his shoes and socks. Then she disappeared briefly, returning with a basin and a pitcher. <br>She poured the water for him while he washed his face and neck and rinsed out his mouth. Afterwards he sat with his legs folded beneath him, enjoying the gentle breeze flowing between the latticed balcony and the window overlooking the courtyard.<br><br>"What an atrocious summer we're having this year!"<br><br>Pulling the pallet out from under the bed and sitting cross-legged at his feet, Amina replied, "May our Lord be gracious to us." She sighed and continued: "The whole world's a blazing pyre, especially the oven room. The roof terrace is the only place you can breathe in summer &#x2014; once the sun has set."<br><br>She sat there as usual, but time had changed her. She had grown thin, and her face seemed longer, if only because her cheeks were hollow. The locks of hair that escaped from her scarf were turning gray and made her seem older than she was. The beauty spot on her cheek had grown slightly larger. In addition to their customary look of submission, her eyes now revealed a mournful absent-mindedness. Her anguish over the changes that had befallen her was considerable, although at first she had welcomed them as an expression of her grief. Then she had begun to wonder anxiously if she might not need her health to get through the remainder of her life. Yes. . .&nbsp; and the others needed her to be healthy too, but how could everything be put back the way it was before? And she was older, if not old enough to warrant such a transformation. Still, her age had to make a difference.<br><br>Night after night she had stood on the balcony observing the street through the wooden grille. What she could see of the street had not altered, but change had crept through her.<br><br>The voice of the waiter at the coffeehouse echoed through their silent room. She smiled and stole a glance at al-Sayyid Ahmad.<br><br>She dearly loved this street, which stayed awake all night keeping her heart company. It was a friend but ignorant of the heart that loved it through the shutters of the enclosed balcony. Its features filled her mind, and its evening inhabitants were live voices inhabiting her ears &#x2014; like this waiter who never stopped talking, the person with the hoarse voice who commented on the events of the day without getting tired or annoyed, the man with the nervous voice trying his luck at cards with the seven of diamonds and the jack, and the father of Haniya &#x2014;the little girl with whooping cough &#x2014; who night after night would reply when asked about her, "Our Lord will be able to cure her." Oh . . . the balcony seemed to be her special corner of the coffeehouse. Memories of the street paraded before her imagination while her eyes remained fixed on the man's head, which was leaning against the back of the sofa.&nbsp; When the flow of remembered images stopped, she concentrated her attention on her husband. She noticed that the sides of his face were bright red, the way she had grown accustomed to seeing them of late when he returned home. She was uncomfortable about it and asked him apprehensively, "Sir, are you well?"<br><br>He held his head up and muttered, "Well, praise God." Then he added, "But the weather is atrocious."<br><br>Clear raisin liqueur was the best drink in summer. That was what they had repeatedly told him, but he could not stand it. For him it was whiskey or nothing. Thus every day he had to put up with summer hangovers, and it was a ferocious summer. He had really laughed hard that evening. He had laughed until the veins of his neck were sore. But what had all the laughter been about? He could hardly remember. There seemed to be nothing to relate or repeat. Yet the atmosphere of their party had been charged with such a sympathetic electricity that a touch had sufficed to set off a flash. The moment Mr. Ibrahim al-Far said, "Alexandria set sail from Sa'd Zaghlul Pasha today heading for Paris," reversing his words, they had all burst out laughing, since they considered that remark an exquisite example of a slip of the tongue caused by intoxication. <br><br>They had been quick to add, "He will continue negotiating until he regains his health, when he will set sail for the invitation in response to the London he received from" or "He will receive Ramsay MacDonald from the independence of the agreement" and "He will return with Egypt for independence." They had begun to discuss the anticipated negotiations, larding their comment with whatever jests they saw fit.<br><br>Vast as his world of friends was, it really boiled down to three: Muhammad Iffat, Ali Abd al-Rahim, and Ibahim al-Far. Cold he imagine the world's existence without them? The way their faces lit up with genuine joy when they saw him made him happier than anything else could. His dreamy eyes met Amina's inquisitive ones. As though to remind her of something extremely important, he said, "Tomorrow."<br><br>With a beaming face she replied, "How could I forget?"<br><br>He did not attempt to conceal his pride when he commented, "It's said that the baccalaureate results were awful this year."<br><br>She smiled once more to share in his pride and said, "May our Lord make his efforts successful and let us live long enough to see him obtain his degree."<br><br>"Did you go to Sugar Street today?" he asked.<br><br>"Yes," she replied, "and I invited everyone. They'll all come except the old lady, who excused herself because she's so tired. Her two sons will congratulate Kamal on her behalf."<br><br>Gesturing toward his cloak with his chin, al-Sayyid Ahmad said, "Today Shaykh Mutawalli Abd al-Samad brought me amulets for the children of Khadija and Aisha. His wish for me was: 'God willing, I'll make you amulets for your grandchildren's children.'"<br><br>Shaking his head, he smiled and continued, "Nothing's impossible for God. Shaykh Mutawalli himself is like iron even though he's in his eighties."<br><br>"May our Lord grant you health and strength."<br><br>He reflected for a time while he counted on his fingers. Then he observed, "If my father had lived, may God be compassionate to him, he would not have been much older than the shaykh." <br><br>"May God have mercy on all those who have departed this life."<br><br>Silence reigned until the impact of the reference to the dead had dissipated. As though remembering something important, the man said, "Zaynab's gotten engaged!"<br><br>Amina's eyes grew wide. She raised her head and asked, "Really?"<br><br>"Yes, Muhammad Iffat told me tonight."<br><br>"Who is it?"<br><br>"A civil servant named Muhammad Hasan, who is head of the records office in the Ministry of Education."<br><br>She commented despondently, "It sounds as though he's advanced in years."<br><br>"Not at all," he objected. "He's in his thirties, thirty-five, thirty-six, forty at the most." He continued sarcastically, "She tried her luck with young men and failed. I mean young men with no backbone. Let her try her luck with mature men."<br><br>Amina said sorrowfully, "Yasin would have been better for her, if only because of their son."<br><br>Al-Sayyid Ahmad shared her opinion, which he had defended for a long time with Muhammad Iffat. In order to conceal his failure, he did not mention that he agreed and said with annoyance, "Her father no longer trusts Yasin, and in truth he's not trustworthy. That's why I didn't insist on it. I was unwilling to exploit our friendship and make her father accept something that would end badly."<br><br>Amina mumbled sympathetically, "A youthful mistake can be forgiven."<br><br>Her husband felt he could acknowledge some portion of his unsuccessful effort and remarked, "I didn't neglect Yasin's rights but met with no encouragement. Muhammad Iffat told me, 'My first reason for refusing is my concern that our friendship might be exposed to discord.' He also said, 'I would not be able to refuse a request from you, but our friendship is dearer to me than your request.' So I stopped talking about it."<br><br>Muhammad Iffat had actually said that, but only to fend off al-Sayyid Ahmad's insistent urging. Because of his friend's high standing with him and in society, al-Sayyid Ahmad had been very keen to restore his bond with Muhammad Iffat, which was severed when their children were divorced. although he could not hope to find a better wife for Yasin than Zaynab, he was forced to accept the calamity of divorce and remarriage, especially after his friend had told him bluntly at least part of what he knew of Yasin's private life. Muhammad Iffat had even remarked, "Don't tell me we're the same as Yasin. We differ in several respects, and the fact is that I have higher standards for my daughter Zaynab's husband than for her mother's."<br><br>Amina inquired, "Does Yasin know what's happened?"<br><br>"He'll learn tomorrow or the next day. Do you think he'll mind? He's the last person to be concerned about honor in marriage."<br><br>Amina shook her head sadly and asked, "What about Ridwan?"<br><br>Al-Sayyid Ahmad replied with a frown, "He'll stay with his grandfather or go with his mother, if he can't bear to be separated from her. May God embarrass those who have caused the boy this embarrassment."<br><br>"My Lord, the poor child &#x2014; his mother one place and his father another. . . . Can Zaynab really bear to be parted from him?"<br><br>Her husband replied with apparent disdain, "Necessity has its own laws." Then he asked, "When will he be old enough to come to his father? Do you remember?"<br><br>Amina thought for a bit and said, "He's a little younger than Na'ima, Aisha's daughter, and a little older than Khadija's son Abd al-Mun'im. So he must be five, and his father can claim custody in two years. Isn't that right, sir?"<br><br>Yawning, al-Sayyid replied, "We'll see when the time comes." Then he went on: "He's been married before. I mean her new husband."<br><br>"Does he have children?"<br><br>"No. His first wife didn't bear any."<br><br>"Perhaps that helped endear him to Mr. Muhammad Iffat."<br><br>The man retorted angrily, "Don't forget his rank!"<br><br>Amina protested, "If it was merely a question of social status no one could match your son, if only for your sake."<br><br>He felt indignant and secretly cursed Muhammad Iffat, despite his love for the man. But then he reiterated the point that consoled him: "Don't forget that had it not been for his desire to safeguard our friendship, he would not have hesitated to honor my request."<br><br>Amina echoed this sentiment: "Of course, naturally sir. It's a lifelong friendship and not something to be trifled with or taken lightly."<br><br>He began yawning once more and muttered, "Take the lamp."<br><br>She rose to carry out his order. He closed his eyes for a moment before rising in a single bound, as though to overcome his inertia. He headed for his bed to stretch out. Now he felt fine. How good it was to lie down when exhausted. Yes, his head pulsed and throbbed, but he almost always had some kind of headache. Let him praise God in any case. Being totally at ease was a thing of the past.</p><h2>Keeping Secrets (Orphan Train Adventures)</h2><p>In 1863, eleven-year-old Peg Kelly is drawn into the dangerous activities of a mysterious young woman who had come to her home in Missouri after fleeing the raid of William Quantrill and his raiders on Lawrence, Kansas</p><p>Breaking promises. . . <p></p> <p>Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield's father teaches them a secret language called Ithig.

In the autumn of 1863, Violet Hennessey, a seemingly nervous young woman, seeks refuge from rampaging bushwhackers with 11-year-old Peg Kelly's family in their St. Joseph, Missouri, home. Peg is preoccupied with trying to be as brave as her brothers and sisters and is drawn to the visitor who treats her as an adult. However, Peg finds many of Violet's actions puzzling, and begins to wonder if she is a Confederate spy. Violet is, in fact, a Union spy, and by the end of this tale, Peg has helped her transmit information vital to breaking the siege of Chattanooga; Violet's brother-in-law has been shot by bushwhackers; and Peg's brother Danny is dead of a fever, which worsened after he left his sickbed to save his sister and Violet from violence at the hands of Confederate sympathizers. Unfortunately, the characters are all one-dimensional. Although Peg professes an ardent desire to grow up, in these pages she does not grow but simply and automatically reacts to the situations in which she is placed. The writing is serviceable, the historical references are wooden, and the plotting is contrived.<br><i>Anne Scott, Johnston Public Library, IA</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Worm Ouroboros</h2><p>When J.R.R.

This book tells the Stone's story, from its discovery by Napoleon's expedition to Egypt to its current--and controversial-- status as the single most visited object on display in the British Museum. </p><p> A pharaoh's forgotten decree, cut in granite in three scripts--Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian demotic, and ancient Greek--the Rosetta Stone promised to unlock the door to the language of ancient Egypt and its 3,000 years of civilization, if only it could be deciphered. Capturing the drama of the race to decode this key to the ancient past, John Ray traces the paths pursued by the British polymath Thomas Young and Jean-Francois Champollion, the "father of Egyptology" ultimately credited with deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. He shows how Champollion "broke the code" and explains more generally how such deciphering is done, as well as its critical role in the history of Egyptology. Concluding with a chapter on the political and cultural controversy surrounding the Stone, the book also includes an appendix with a full translation of the Stone's text. </p><p> Rich in anecdote and curious lore, <i>The Rosetta Stone and the Rebirth of Ancient Egypt</i> is a brilliant and frequently amusing guide to one of history's great mysteries and marvels. </p></p><p>John Ray is Herbert Thompson Professor of Egyptology at Cambridge University, and is also a Fellow of Selwyn College.<br>Reviewed by Jonathon Keats<p>As an Egyptian pharaoh, Ptolemy V was a glorified placeholder. Just to preserve his royal title and protect his status as a god, he gave tax breaks to priests and performed favors for two sacred bulls, worshipped by commoners, named Apis and Mnevis. We know this because it is written, in three languages, on the Rosetta Stone.</p><p>Before the Rosetta Stone was found by Napoleon's army in 1799, Ptolemy's ploys were understandably forgotten, yet he wasn't the only pharaoh whose feats were unknown: Even the legacy of Ramses, builder of the great temple at Karnak, had sunk into hieroglyphic obscurity. For many centuries, nobody could read hieroglyphics. As Cambridge professor John Ray writes in The Rosetta Stone, the fractured granite slab "gave us back one of the longest and most romantic chapters of our history, a chapter which had been thought lost beyond recall." Ray's brief book evokes the process of rediscovery, succinctly capturing the story of the stone's recovery and decipherment and passionately, albeit unoriginally, arguing for the slab's iconic status. Like Ptolemy V, the Rosetta Stone is of accidental significance. One of many stelae -- stone markers -- produced as political propaganda in the year 196 B.C., it advertised the pharaoh's generosity to three key constituencies -- the Greek government, the Egyptian people and the otherworldly gods -- each of whom used a different script. The gods happened to read hieroglyphics.</p><p>Evidently, they were not impressed by Ptolemy's antics. The temple where the stone rested fell to ruin, and the granite was recycled in a citadel in the town of Rosetta until the French invaded Egypt in 1798, and, to keep the British Navy at bay, decided to remodel. A year into the job, an engineering officer named Pierre Francois-Xavier Bouchard stumbled upon the century's greatest archaeological find.</p><p>By 1801, the Royal Navy had taken Egypt from Napoleon and seized the plunder of war. This included Bouchard's slab of granite, destined to become, according to Ray, "the most famous object in the British Museum." The real story begins here, for the stone became iconic as a consequence of its decipherment, or rather through the decoding of Egyptian history with this hieroglyphic key. The British and the French both played crucial roles, and many have read the decipherment as a continuation of their political rivalry. Ray acknowledges this, yet wisely concentrates his attention on the personal ambitions of Thomas Young and Jean-Francois Champollion, the two men who did the actual scholarship. </p><p>Young was the first to work on the stone. He was not a likely candidate. Egypt didn't interest him especially, at least not as much as biology and physics, fields to which he routinely contributed major discoveries. For instance, Young figured out how humans perceive color and, in one of the most elegant experiments ever, demonstrated that light travels in waves. "Much of his work is characterized by a feeling that all truths, however complex, could be expressed in terms that were essentially simple," writes Ray. Pre-Rosetta Egyptology, on the other hand, was mired in enigma, operating under the assumption that the land of pharaohs was a "nation of philosophers and religious visionaries [who] codified their profoundest insights into the symbols on their obelisks and temples."</p><p>All of this was naturally distasteful to Young, yet the scientist could not resist a conundrum, and from his position outside Egyptology, he was able to approach the stone with unsentimental mathematical discipline. "Young stripped away the mystery which had accumulated round Egyptian hieroglyphs," Ray writes, "and showed that they too obeyed rational rules."</p><p>Working out those rules in detail was another matter, requiring deep immersion in ancient Egyptian culture, an obsession of Champollion. While Young was a pragmatist, Champollion was a romantic -- "the Byron of scholarship" in Ray's phrasing -- able to reconnect hieroglyphics with the myths that inspired the Egyptians to write. "Hieroglyphic writing is a complex system," wrote Champollion, "a script at the same time figurative, symbolic, and phonetic, in one and the same text, in one and the same sentence, and, if I may put it, almost in one and the same word." Ray is at his best when elucidating this intellectual history, which he might have examined at greater length in place of maddeningly vague chapters on Egyptology after Champollion, other famous decipherments and the history of looting. Of course, if studied with the rigor of Young or the imagination of Champollion, the stone could yield a key to any of these subjects. A political platform, a citadel block and a linguistic database, the Rosetta Stone is as useful, and significant, as we make it.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

The poems collected in this book are at the heart of the film Il Postino, a cinematic fantasy spun from an apocryphal incident in the life of the Chilean poet and Nobel laureate, Pablo Neruda. Together they show why many consider Neruda to be the finest love poet of the century. Few writers of any age have described the pleasures and torments of erotic love with such un-sentimental directness and sensual precision. Here, too, we find Neruda at his most accessible, the language of his odes and lyrics refined to the point at which it achieves, in critic Jean Franco's words, "the naturalness of song". This short selection draws on work from throughout his writing life, from the famous early collection Twenty Love Songs &amp; a Song of Despair (1924) to the key works of his maturity, Residence on Earth (1935), Elemental Odes (1954) and the autobiographical Memorial de Isla Negra (1964). It offers an enticing glimpse of one of modern poetry's greatest masters.</p><p>Born Neftal-Ricardo Reyes Basoalto in southern Chile in 1904, Pablo Neruda led a life charged with poetic and political activity. His first book, Crepusculario (Twilight) was published in 1923. The following year, he published Veinte Poemas de Amor y una Cancion Desesperada (Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair), which turned him into a celebrity. In 1927 he began his long career as a diplomat, serving as Chilean consul in numerous places including Burma, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Mexico and France. He was elected to the Chilean Senate in 1943 but later expelled for being a Communist. In 1952 the government withdrew the order to arrest leftist writers and political figures, and Neruda returned to Chile. For the next twenty-one years, he continued a career that integrated private and public concerns and became known as the people&#39;s poet. During this time, Neruda received numerous prestigious awards, including the International Peace Prize in 1950, the Lenin Peace Prize and the Stalin Peace Prize in 1953, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. He died of leukaemia in Santiago, Chile in 1973.Text: English, Spanish (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Incredible Comparisons</h2><p>This new visual guide, with hundreds of illustrated comparisons of objects from the world around us, turns statistics into pictures through tangible evidence of sizes, heights, speeds, and numbers, while revealing a whole new world to young readers.</p><p>Russell Ash is the uncontested king of lists. Not simply a career, listmaking is his legend, facts his friends, statistics his sanctuary, trivia his triumph. <p>He was descended from a family of craftsmen who were London goldsmiths and silversmiths for several generations since the 17th century -- the most notable being Claudius Ash (1792-1854), one of the principal inventors of false teeth. His father was a bookbinder at the British Museum. Born in 1946, educated at Bedford Modern School, Mr. Ash attended Durham University where he earned a Joint Honours BA in Anthropology and Geology. </p><p>Russell Ash began his career in publishing as a picture researcher in 1967; he moved on in 1973 to establish his own publishing company, Ash &amp; Grant, and was a director of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson and Pavilion Books. Mr. Ash has spent most of the past 30 years as a freelance writer and contributor to almost 100 non-fiction titles on such subjects as art (particularly the Impressionists and other late nineteenth-century painters), animals real and fictitious (he is the official "biographer" of Paddington Bear), and humor. </p><p>He has compiled various award-winning popular reference titles, including the perennial bestselling Top Ten of Everything, which has also inspired a weekly network children's television series in the UK (in which he appears). He has also written Incredible Comparisons, which features a variety of fascinating objects side by side with accompanying statistics. The World in One Day is his 1997 bestseller for children, chronicling all the facts about daily life. His latest children's book, Factastic Millennium Facts, is packed with intriguing information and entertaining anecdotes covering the key worldwide political, social , and cultural events of the last 1,000 years. </p><p>Russell Ash is currently an author, occasional journalist, and packager of books in the UK and US. He lives in a large Victorian house (which he is restoring) in Sussex, England with his wife, daughter, and two sons. He has recently returned to the family tradition by learning the craft of silversmithing.</p>Grade 5-8. This eye-catching book makes comparisons based on known quantities rather than numerical measurements. For example, the weight of the blue whale is compared verbally and graphically to the weight of 26 African elephants. Double-page spreads are devoted to the measurement of comparative sizes, weights, volumes, heights, speeds, and distances. The scope includes the cosmos, Earth, and life on it. The introduction defines the basic yardsticks to be used; once comparisons are made to these points of reference, these new comparisons may be used in later sections. There are straight equivalencies, such as the population of Seoul being equal to the population of Australia. Other comparisons are proportional: if a man could jump as far as a grasshopper, he could long jump 103 feet instead of merely the world record of 29 feet. The informative, entertaining illustrations are used effectively to demonstrate the topics covered. A minor quibble is that while the index helps locate references to specific items, it does not indicate what is measured.

Florian Kilderry couldn?t know that the Connultys are said to own half the town: he has only come to Rathmoye to photograph the scorched remains of its burnt- out cinema.<br><br> A few miles out in the country, Dillahan, a farmer and a decent man, has married again: Ellie is the young convent girl who came to work for him when he was widowed. Ellie leads a quiet, routine life, often alone while Dillahan runs the farm.<br><br> Florian is planning to leave Ireland and start over. Ellie is settled in her new role as Dillahan?s wife. But Florian?s visit to Rathmoye introduces him to Ellie, and a dangerously reckless attachment begins.<br><br> In a characteristically masterly way Trevor evokes the passions and frustrations felt by Ellie and Florian, and by the people of a small Irish town during one long summer.<br></p><p>William Trevor is the author of twenty-nine books, including <b>Felicia&#x2019;s Journey</b>, which won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and was made into a motion picture. In 1996 he was the recipient of the Lannan Award for Fiction. In 2001, he won the <b>Irish Times</b> Literature Prize for fiction.

He lives in Devon, England.<b>1.</b><br><br>On a June evening some years after the middle of the last century Mrs Eileen Connulty passed through the town of Rathmoye: from Number 4 The Square to Magennis Street, into Hurley Lane, along Irish Street, across Cloughjordan Road to the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer. Her night was spent there.<br><br>The life that had come to an end had been one of good works and resolution, with a degree of severity in domestic and family matters. The anticipation of personal contentment, which had long ago influenced Mrs Connulty&#x2019;s acceptance of the married state and the bearing of two children, had since failed her: she had been disappointed in her husband and in her daughter. As death approached, she had feared she would now be obliged to join her husband and prayed she would not have to. Her daughter she was glad to part from; her son &#x2014; now in his fiftieth year, her pet since first he lay in her arms as an infant &#x2014; Mrs Connulty had wept to leave behind.<br><br>The blinds of private houses, drawn down as the coffin went by, were released soon after it had passed. Shops that had closed opened again. Men who had uncovered their heads replaced caps or hats, children who had ceased to play in Hurley Lane were no longer constrained. The undertakers descended the steps of the church. Tomorrow&#x2019;s Mass would bring a bishop; until the very last, Mrs Connulty would be given her due.<br><br>People at that time said the family Mrs Connulty had married into owned half of Rathmoye, an impression created by their licensed premises in Magennis Street, their coal yards in St Matthew Street, and Number 4 The Square, a lodging house established by the Connultys in 1903. During the decades that had passed since then there had been the acquisition of other properties in the town; repaired and generally put right, they brought in modest rents that, accumulating, became a sizeable total. But even so it was an exaggeration when people said that the Connultys owned half of Rathmoye.<br><br>Compact and ordinary, it was a town in a hollow that had grown up there for no reason that anyone knew or wondered about. Farmers brought in livestock on the first Monday of every month, and borrowed money from one of Rathmoye&#x2019;s two banks. They had their teeth drawn by the dentist who practised in the Square, from time to time consulted a solicitor there, inspected the agricultural machinery at Des Devlin&#x2019;s on the Nenagh road, dealt with Heffernan the seed merchant, drank in one of the town&#x2019;s many public houses. Their wives shopped for groceries from the warehouse shelves of the Cash and Carry, or in McGovern&#x2019;s if they weren&#x2019;t economizing; for shoes in Tyler&#x2019;s; for clothes, curtain material and oilcloth in Corbally&#x2019;s drapery. There had once been employment at the mill, and at the mill&#x2019;s electricity plant before the Shannon Scheme came; there was employment now at the creamery and the condensed-milk factory, in builders&#x2019; yards, in shops and public houses, at the bottled-water plant. There was a courthouse in the Square, an abandoned railway station at the end of Mill Street. There were two churches and a convent, a Christian Brothers&#x2019; school and a technical school. Plans for a swimming-pool were awaiting the acquisition of funds.<br><br>Nothing happened in Rathmoye, its people said, but most of them went on living there. It was the young who left &#x2014; for Dublin or Cork or Limerick, for England, sometimes for America. A lot came back. That nothing happened was an exaggeration too.<br><br>The funeral Mass was on the morning of the following day, and when it was over Mrs Connulty&#x2019;s mourners stood about outside the cemetery gates, declaring that she would never be forgotten in the town and beyond it. The women who had toiled beside her in the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer asserted that she had been an example to them all. They recalled how no task had been too menial for her to undertake, how the hours spent polishing a surfeit of brass or scraping away old candle-grease had never been begrudged. The altar flowers had not once in sixty years gone in need of fresh water; the missionary leaflets were replaced when necessary. Small repairs had been effected on cassocks and surplices and robes. Washing the chancel tiles had been a sacred duty.<br><br>While such recollections were shared, and the life that had ended further lauded, a young man in a pale tweed suit that stood out a bit on a warm morning surreptitiously photographed the scene. He had earlier cycled the seven and a half miles from where he lived, and was then held up by the funeral traffic. He had come to photograph the town&#x2019;s burnt-out cinema, which he had heard about in a similar small town where recently he had photographed the perilous condition of a terrace of houses wrenched from their foundations in a landslip.<br><br>Dark-haired and thin, in his early twenties, the young man was a stranger in Rathmoye. A suggestion of stylishness &#x2014; in his general demeanour, in his jaunty green-and-bluestriped tie &#x2014; was repudiated by the comfortable bagginess of his suit. His features had a misleading element of seriousness in their natural cast, contributing further to this impression of contradiction. His name was Florian Kilderry.<br><br>&#x2018;Whose funeral?&#x2019; he enquired in the crowd, returning to it from where he had temporarily positioned himself behind a parked car in order to take his photographs. He nodded when he was told, then asked for directions to the ruined cinema. &#x2018;Thanks,&#x2019; he said politely, his smile friendly. &#x2018;Thanks,&#x2019; he said again, and pushed his bicycle through the throng of mourners.<br><br>Neither Mrs Connulty&#x2019;s son nor her daughter knew that the funeral attendance had been recorded in such a manner, and when they made their way, separately, back to Number 4 The Square they remained ignorant of this unusual development. The crowd began to disperse then, many to gather again in Number 4, others to return to their interrupted morning. The last to go was an old Protestant called Orpen Wren, who believed the coffin that had been interred contained the mortal remains of an elderly kitchenmaid whose death had occurred thirty-four years ago in a household he had known well. The respectful murmur of voices around him dwindled to nothing; cars drove off. Alone where he stood, Orpen Wren remained for a few moments longer before he, too, went on his way.<br><br>*<br><br>Cycling out of the town, Ellie wondered who the man who&#x2019;d been taking photographs was. The way he&#x2019;d asked about the old picture house you could tell he didn&#x2019;t know Rathmoye at all, and she&#x2019;d never seen him on the streets or in a shop. She wondered if he was connected with the Connultys, since it was the Connultys who owned the picture house and since it had been Mrs Connulty&#x2019;s funeral. She&#x2019;d never seen photographs taken at a funeral before, and supposed the Connultys could have employed him to do it. Or he was maybe off a newspaper, the <i>Nenagh News </i>or the <i>Nationalist</i>, because sometimes in a paper you&#x2019;d see a picture of a funeral. If she&#x2019;d gone back to the house afterwards she could have asked Miss Connulty, but the artificial-insemination man was expected and she&#x2019;d said she&#x2019;d be there.<br><br>She hurried in case she&#x2019;d be late, although she had worked it out that she wouldn&#x2019;t be. She would have liked to go back to the house. She&#x2019;d have liked to see the inside of it, which she never had, although she&#x2019;d been supplying Mrs Connulty with eggs for a long time.<br><br>It could be the photographs were something the priests wanted, that maybe Father Balfe kept a parish book like she&#x2019;d once been told by Sister Clare a priest might. Keeping a book would be more like Father Balfe than Father Millane, not that she knew what it would contain. She wondered if she&#x2019;d be in a photograph herself. When the camera was held up to take a picture she remembered slender, fragile-seeming hands.<br><br>The white van was in the yard and Mr Brennock was getting out of it. She said she was sorry, and he said what for? She said she&#x2019;d make him a cup of tea.<br><br>*<br><br>After he had spent only a few minutes at the remains of the cinema, Florian Kilderry broke his journey at a roadside public house called the Dano Mahoney. He had been interrupted at the cinema by a man who had noticed his bicycle and came in to tell him he shouldn&#x2019;t be there. The man had pointed out that there was a notice and Florian said he hadn&#x2019;t seen it, although in fact he had. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s permission needed,&#x2019; the man crossly informed him, admitting when he snapped shut the two padlocks securing the place that they shouldn&#x2019;t have been left open. &#x2018;See Miss O&#x2019;Keeffe in the coal yards,&#x2019; he advised. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll get permission if she thinks fit.&#x2019; But when Florian asked about the whereabouts of the coal yards he was told they were closed today as a mark of respect. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll have noticed a funeral,&#x2019; the man said.<br><br>In the bar Florian took a glass of wine to a corner and lit a cigarette. He had had a wasted journey, the unexpected funeral his only compensation, and from memory he tried to recall the images of it he had gathered. The mourners had conversed in twos and threes, a priest among them, several nuns. A few, alone, had begun to move away; others had stood awkwardly, as if feeling they should stay longer. The scene had been a familiar one: he had photographed funerals before, had once or twice been asked to desist. Sometimes there was a moment of drama, or a display of uncontrollable grief, but today there had been neither.<br><br>On the other hand, what he had been allowed to see of the cinema was promising. Through smashed glass a poster still advertised <i>Idiot&#x2019;s Delight</i>, the features of Norma Shearer cut about and distorted. He&#x2019;d been scrutinizing them when the man shouted at him, but he never minded something like that. The Coliseum the cinema had been called, Western Electric sound newly installed.<br><br>A smell of frying bacon wafted into the bar, and voices on a radio. Sporting heroes &#x2014; wrestlers, boxers, jockeys, hurlers &#x2014; decorated the walls, with greyhounds and steeple-chasers. The publican, a framed newspaper item declared, had been a pugilist himself, had gone five rounds with Jack Doyle, the gloves he&#x2019;d worn hanging from a shelf behind the bar. &#x2018;Give a rap on the old counter if you&#x2019;d want a refill,&#x2019; he advised when a woman summoned him to the meal she&#x2019;d cooked. But Florian said the single glass would be enough. He sat for a while longer, finishing a second cigarette, and then carried his empty glass to the bar. A voice called out goodbye and invited him to look in again. He said he would.<br><br>Outside, in warm afternoon sunshine, he stood for a few minutes, eyes half closed, his back against one of the entrance-door pillars. Then, riding slowly, he continued his journey. He lived alone. He wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry.<br><br>*<br><br>The day advanced in Rathmoye. Disturbed by death, the town settled again into its many routines. Number 4 The Square was put to rights after nearly a hundred sympathizers had accepted the invitation to funeral refreshment. Trays of cups and saucers were carried down from the vast first-floor sitting-room to the kitchen, scattered glasses gathered up, windows thrown open, ashtrays emptied. By the time the stairs had been hoovered, tea-towels hung up to dry and the daily girl sent home, it was evening.<br><br>Alone in the house, as she had not been since the death, Mrs Connulty&#x2019;s daughter fondled the jewellery that now was hers: strings of lapis and jade, garnet and amber, the sapphire earrings, the turquoise, the pearls, the opals, the half-hoops of diamonds, the ruby engagement ring, the three cameos. There was a rosary too, but it did not properly belong, being of little value compared with the finery.<br><br>In her middle age, Miss Connulty was known in Rathmoye no more intimately than that &#x2014; a formality imposed upon her when, twenty years ago, her mother ceased to address her by either of the saints&#x2019; names she had been given at her birth. Unconsciously, her brother had followed this example, and when her father died she was nameless in the house. By now, &#x2018;Miss Connulty&#x2019; belonged to her more naturally in the town than the form of address she had once enjoyed there.<br><br>Thirty-two pieces she counted, not one of them unfamiliar to her, and she would wear them and wear them often, as her mother had. This reflection came coolly, without emotion. Some of the pieces would suit her, some would not. &#x2018;What are you doing, child?&#x2019; her mother had long ago sharply demanded, unexpectedly in this same room, her slippered feet making no sound. A garnet necklace draped her child&#x2019;s neck, not hooked at the back, the clasp held between finger and thumb. It dropped with a clatter on to the dressing-table, and Mrs Connulty, tall and stoutly made, declared that the Guards must be sent for.<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t get the Guards! Oh, don&#x2019;t, don&#x2019;t!&#x2019; Her own cry of alarm came back to Miss Connulty from childhood, fear cold again in her stomach. &#x2018;Go out for a Guard, Kitty,&#x2019; her mother called down the stairs to a startled maid, and ordered the necklace to be put away. She went through the pieces to see that they were all there. A Guard was in the hall then, and her mother ordered her to tell him, and when she did he shook his head at her.<br><br>Less tall than her mother, and not stout at all, Miss Connulty retained the shadow of a prettiness that had enlivened her as a girl. Grey streaked her hair, darkening its fairness, but few lines aged her features. Even so, she often felt old, and resented this reminder that in reaching middle age and passing through most of it she had missed too much of what she might have had. She returned the jewellery to the top drawer of the dressing-table that had been her mother&#x2019;s and now was hers. She kept out only the garnet necklace, admiring it against the drab shade of her mourning.<br><br>*<br><br>Joseph Paul Connulty was a lanky, weasel-faced man with grey hair brushed straight back and gleaming beneath a regular application of Brylcreme. Spectacles dangled on a tape around his neck, falling on to the dark serge of his suit. Two ballpoint pens were clipped into his outside breast pocket. The emblem of the Pioneer movement was prominent on his left lapel.<br><br>At a loss after he had been to the cemetery again in order to linger on his own by the closed grave, he went to the coal yards. The sheds were locked, there was a notice on the office door; sacks that bore his name were stacked upright on a lorry, waiting to be delivered. He felt at home here, had all his life known the mounds of slack, the stables where once there&#x2019;d been horses, the high gates sheeted with corrugated iron, its red paint worn away in places. In childhood he had played here, but had not been allowed in the public house, which even now &#x2014; teetotaller that he was &#x2014; felt alien to him, although he spent most of every day there. His hope had been to become a priest, but the vocation had slipped away from him, lost beneath the weight of his mother&#x2019;s doubt that he would make a success of the religious life. In the end her doubt became his own.<br><br>He locked the high gates behind him when he left and did not hurry on his way to Number 4 The Square. He passed the public house, closed also, and the deadness of the place gave him pleasure, for usually music and a muddle of voices spilt out on to the street. It was quiet, too, in the hall of the house where, being a bachelor, he took his meals and slept, where all his life he had lived.<br><br>&#x2018;A garden of remembrance has been mentioned to me,&#x2019; he passed on to his sister when they met on the first-floor landing.<br><br>Although they were more than brother and sister, having been born in the same few minutes, they had never shared a resemblance. In childhood they had been close companions but often now did not communicate with one another for weeks on end, though less through not being on speaki...</p><h2>Sonia Delaunay the Life of an Artist</h2><p>(Artist Biography) BARON, Stanley with Jacques Damase. &#39;Sonia Delaunay: The Life of an Artist.&#39; Harry N.

The author interviewed every living woman scientist who is a subject in this book and 250 of their colleagues, associates, and family members. She has lectured about women in science at many places here and abroad. She lives in Seattle, Washington.As the subtitle suggests, this book describes the lives and struggles of 14 women who were either awarded the Nobel Prize or played a critical part in the work of the men who received it. And the "struggles" were horrendous. From the nonadmission policies of most graduate schools, even as late as 1960, to the restrictive admission policies even at the undergraduate level, simply obtaining an adequate education in the sciences was a battle for women. And, with few exceptions, most of them had to take unpaid or lowly paid jobs if they wanted to do science. Tenured positions might be offered after the Nobel Prize was won! Bertsch is a former newspaper reporter, and her background is reflected in her terse, dramatic treatment of each woman. There is an excellent set of references, as well as a thoughtful introduction and conclusion. At the outset, Bertsch asks "Why so few?"--at the conclusion, given the trials and tribulations, one wonders how so many endured. Highly recommended for all science collections.<br><i>- Hilary D.

Weren&#x2019;t there limits to repaying a debt?<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Wheeler, Ms. Monroe and Miss Hudson have arrived,&#x201d; Marjorie, the firm&#x2019;s receptionist, announced through the intercom.<br> <br>Send them away. Far, far away . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Send them in.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete stood and adjusted his cuffs for something to do with his hands, mentally preparing for the reading of the will&#x2014;and the breaking of the news.<br> <br>The door opened and Fritz&#x2019;s daughters, Allie and Des, walked in, smiling and offering hugs and kisses on the cheek. It wasn&#x2019;t a secret that their father&#x2019;s estate was quite substantial, and Pete had no doubt the two women were already mentally spending their shares.<br> <br>&#x201c;Allie, Des. Great to see you girls,&#x201d; he said, before reminding himself of the somber reason for their presence. He cleared his throat and assumed a solemn expression. &#x201c;Again, my condolences to you both.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And to you as well.&#x201d; Des gave his hand a squeeze. &#x201c;Since you were closer to Dad than either of us, I suppose you&#x2019;ll miss him more than anyone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d give anything to have him here with us today.&#x201d; So I could wring his neck the way I should have when he was alive. Or at the very least, if he were here today, he could do his own dirty work.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; Allie looked around the office. &#x201c;New d�cor? I like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks. All that leather and those prints of English hunting dogs were starting to get to me.&#x201d; He smiled to himself.<br> <br>Six months ago, Fritz had stood in the middle of Pete&#x2019;s office with his hands on his hips. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s time for all that tired old &#x2018;tally ho!&#x2019; stuff to go, Pete? I&#x2019;m pretty sure that style went out in the nineties.&#x201d;<br> <br>I should&#x2019;ve tied him to a chair right then and there, dialed the phone, handed it to him, and not let him up until he&#x2019;d come clean with his kids. All his kids.<br> <br>&#x201c;Allie, how&#x2019;s Nikki doing? The new school working out for her?&#x201d; Pete offered a chair to the tall, slender blonde, who seemed a bit on edge.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s doing just fine, thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m great.&#x201d; The sarcasm in Allie&#x2019;s voice was unmistakable. &#x201c;Except that the TV show I was working on was canceled and I&#x2019;m going to have to sell my house because I can&#x2019;t afford the upkeep and my half of Nikki&#x2019;s private school tuition. Other than that, I&#x2019;m just swell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry things aren&#x2019;t better for you right now. But you have a lot of directing credits, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Assistant directing,&#x201d; she corrected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Still, you have a recognizable name. I&#x2019;m sure someone will call.&#x201d; He tried to be encouraging, but could see by her expression that she wasn&#x2019;t buying it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, once Dad&#x2019;s estate is settled, you&#x2019;ll be able to turn things around.&#x201d; Des, who was three years younger and four inches shorter than her sister, hadn&#x2019;t waited for a chair to be offered before she sat. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what this is all about, right, Uncle Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ahhh . . . well . . . yes, but . . .&#x201d; he stammered. No rehearsal would have been adequate to prepare him for what was ahead this morning.<br> <br>It was then that Allie pointed to the third chair in front of the desk.<br> <br>She frowned. &#x201c;Is someone joining us?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Pete could respond, Marjorie tapped on the door, then opened it. &#x201c;Mr. Wheeler . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah . . . yes.&#x201d; He walked around the desk as a petite woman with curly light auburn hair entered the office. &#x201c;Cara. Come in, please.&#x201d; He embraced her as he had the others. &#x201c;Have a seat.&#x201d;<br> <br>With puzzled expressions, Allie and Des turned to face the newcomer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Allie. Des. This is Cara McCann.&#x201d; He took a deep breath and prepared for the shit storm that was about to occur. &#x201c;Your half sister.&#x201d; He turned to Cara. &#x201c;Cara, meet Allegra Monroe and Desdemona Hudson. Your half sisters.&#x201d;<br> <br>The silence that followed could not have been more intense. The three women stared first at Pete, then at each other for what seemed to be an eternity.<br> <br>Finally, Allie cleared her throat, and with a death stare aimed at Pete, said, &#x201c;What the hell, Uncle Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The hell is that your father lived a double life. On the West Coast, he had Nora and the two of you,&#x201d; he said, addressing Allie and Des. Turning to Cara, he added, &#x201c;And on the East Coast . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He had Susa and me,&#x201d; Cara said quietly, her face white, her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and her eyes on him. &#x201c;Obviously, that&#x2019;s the short version. Surely there&#x2019;s more.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The long version isn&#x2019;t much different. It&#x2019;s just a matter of filling in the blanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I suggest you do that.&#x201d; Des folded her arms across her chest, an I&#x2019;m waiting expression on her face.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is why he didn&#x2019;t want a service or a memorial of any kind,&#x201d; Cara said. &#x201c;He wanted a quick cremation so we wouldn&#x2019;t meet at his graveside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sad but true. When he realized how close he was to the end, he added a codicil to his will that he&#x2019;d be cremated immediately and that you would not be notified until after the cremation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Start from the beginning,&#x201d; Allie said, still glaring. &#x201c;And maybe at some point you could toss in an explanation of why Dad kept this secret to himself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete sighed deeply. &#x201c;If I told him once, I told him a thousand times that this was a stupid way to live. That he needed to come clean, to tell Nora that he was going to go through with the divorce. That he&#x2019;d met someone who made him happy.&#x201d; He glanced at Cara, his voice softening. &#x201c;Your mother made your father very happy, Cara.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying he didn&#x2019;t love our mother and she made him miserable?&#x201d; Allie snapped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, of course she did.&#x201d; Des turned to her sister. &#x201c;We both know that. Come to think of it, she made both of us pretty miserable, too. How long can you love someone who makes you feel sad, inadequate, and unloved all the time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our mother you&#x2019;re talking about, Des. The woman who gave birth to us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And regretted that she did. Let&#x2019;s face it. Mom liked the idea of children way more than she ever liked actually having children. When she could whip us out in front of a camera to smooth out her image after she&#x2019;d been on a bender, we served a purpose. Other than that, she really didn&#x2019;t have much use for either of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Allie could respond, Cara leaned forward and said, &#x201c;Wait . . . back up. I think I may have missed something. Go back to the part where you told Dad he had to tell . . . the other woman he was going through with the divorce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Careful, missy.&#x201d; Allie trained a lethal glance in Cara&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;That &#x2018;other woman&#x2019; is our mother. And since she and Dad were never divorced, I believe it&#x2019;s your mother who&#x2019;s &#x2018;the other woman.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that true, Uncle Pete? Was Dad still married to their mother when he married mine?&#x201d; Cara&#x2019;s stare ate right through him, and he knew that one of the moments he&#x2019;d dreaded most was upon him.<br> <br>He walked around his desk to sit on the right corner opposite Cara&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;Well, technically . . . yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does that mean? Either he was divorced or he wasn&#x2019;t when he and Susa were married.&#x201d; Cara&#x2019;s eyes bored into Pete&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Was my father divorced from his first wife when he married my mother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did my mother know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I . . . I can&#x2019;t say for sure . . .&#x201d; Pete mumbled. God, how he hated Fritz at that moment.<br> <br>Unexpectedly, Cara laughed. &#x201c;Of course you can. You knew everything about him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think he meant to tell her, in the beginning. But he fell so hard for Susa that as time went on, it became harder and harder to tell her. He wanted to make her happy, wanted to marry her.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;So he did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How could he have married her mother when he was still married to ours?&#x201d; Des asked. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have to apply for a license? Aren&#x2019;t there some sort of checks or something?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete shrugged. &#x201c;I honestly don&#x2019;t know how he got around all that. He just showed up one morning with a bottle of champagne in one hand and two glasses in the other. Asked me to drink a toast to his new bride.&#x201d; Pete paused. If he closed his eyes, he could still see the light in Fritz&#x2019;s eyes. There was no doubt that he&#x2019;d been happier than Pete had ever seen him, and definitely head over heels in love.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you said . . . ?&#x201d; Allie gestured for Pete to get on with it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember exactly what I said, but I&#x2019;m sure it was something to the effect of . . . well, to quote you, Allie, &#x2018;What the hell?&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you ask him about Mom? Did you ask him when he had filed for a divorce?&#x201d; Des asked pointedly. &#x201c;Though I would suspect that as his lawyer, you should&#x2019;ve had a hand in that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did ask, and he hemmed and hawed, the way he did when he didn&#x2019;t want to talk about something.&#x201d; He glanced at each woman before adding, &#x201c;I think you all know what I mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>The three women nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what you&#x2019;re saying is that he was a bigamist.&#x201d; Cara was on the verge of tears. &#x201c;How could he have done something like that to my mother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother?&#x201d; Allie snorted. &#x201c;What about our mother?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did Mom know, Uncle Pete?&#x201d; Des asked quietly.<br> <br>&#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m aware, he never told her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably because they rarely spoke to each other.&#x201d; Allie leaned back in her chair. &#x201c;So can we cut to the chase? What does this all mean in terms of Dad&#x2019;s will?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We find out that Dad had another wife and child and all you can think about is how this news is going to impact your inheritance?&#x201d; Des asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s going to have an impact, assuming that Dad&#x2019;s named her in his will,&#x201d; Allie replied. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m assuming he did, or she wouldn&#x2019;t be here and there&#x2019;d have been no need for this big revelation. Which, frankly, I couldn&#x2019;t care less about. So Dad had a mistress and they had a kid together and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t his mistress,&#x201d; Cara snapped, whirling to face Allie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where I come from, if a woman cohabitates with a married man&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t know he was married. She couldn&#x2019;t have known. She never would have . . .&#x201d; Cara stood. &#x201c;She wouldn&#x2019;t have . . .&#x201d; She choked back tears. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know my mother. You don&#x2019;t know who or what she was.&#x201d;<br> <br>Allie stared out the window behind Pete&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Oh, I have a pretty good idea of what she was.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Allie, stop,&#x201d; Des exclaimed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not? What would you call her? She was sleeping with another woman&#x2019;s husband and had a child with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop it, Allie,&#x201d; Pete said simply. More gently, he said, &#x201c;Cara, sit down. There&#x2019;s more you all need to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>All three women turned to him as if on cue.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, don&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201d; Allie said dramatically. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a third woman out there. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Would it surprise him if there were? Pete pushed the thought from his head, returned to his chair, and took a deep breath. &#x201c;Let me start by saying the three of you are the beneficiaries of Fritz&#x2019;s will, with one&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Allie interrupted. &#x201c;Equal beneficiaries? Her too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Equal.&#x201d; He rested his forearms on the desk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a three-way split, and that is ironclad. I know because I wrote your father&#x2019;s will. So get over it.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Allie opened her mouth&#x2014;apparently not ready to let it go&#x2014;Des said, &#x201c;Oh, for crying out loud. Dad was pretty well-off, Al. He&#x2019;d been a well-known entertainment agent and manager in Hollywood for years. One-third of his investments alone would keep even you in Jimmy Choos for a long, long time.&#x201d; She glanced at Pete. &#x201c;Right, Uncle Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded. &#x201c;Yes. Your father left a large estate. The sum you&#x2019;re each going to inherit will be significant. Assuming that you meet the rest of the conditions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What conditions?&#x201d; Cara asked warily.<br> <br>Now came the hard part. Pete cleared his throat again and launched into the part of the disclosure that he&#x2019;d rehearsed over and over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father loved all of you very much. I know he didn&#x2019;t always go out of his way to show it.&#x201d; He directed these remarks to Allie and Des.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an understatement,&#x201d; grumbled Allie. &#x201c;If you call an occasional phone call proof of how much he loved us.&#x201d; She tossed a dagger at Cara. &#x201c;Of course, now we know why he was so preoccupied.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cara started to protest, but Pete raised a hand. &#x201c;Trust me, there will be plenty of time to snipe at each other later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds ominous,&#x201d; Des said.<br> <br>Pete continued on with his speech. &#x201c;As I said, your father loved you all. He wanted more than anything for you to know and love each other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is why he kept her a secret.&#x201d; Allie pointed in Cara&#x2019;s direction.<br> <br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t tell me about you, either,&#x201d; Cara countered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies. Please.&#x201d; Pete placed a hand on the top of his head, a habit once intended to smooth back his hair, which was now pretty much gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;If it was so important to him that we know each other, why didn&#x2019;t he tell us himself?&#x201d; Cara asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because at his core, he was a coward.&#x201d; There. He&#x2019;d said it. &#x201c;He just couldn&#x2019;t face you. I think he believed it didn&#x2019;t matter so much because Nora was gone. Cara, after Susa died, he couldn&#x2019;t face you with the truth. So he let it go and was convinced that the right time would present itself. As you know, it never did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what comes next?&#x201d; Des asked softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father wanted you all to share in not only his wealth, but in his life.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A little late on that score,&#x201d; Allie scoffed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something he came to very much regret at the end, believe me. He became obsessed with wanting you to know each other. Which is why he left a challenge for the three of you. If you&#x2019;re successful, you inherit his entire estate. If you fail, you get nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>The pronouncement was met with silence and blank stares.<br> <br>Finally, Allie said, &#x201c;Please tell us you&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I assure you, I&#x2019;m not. Nor was this my idea, by the way,&#x201d; Pete told them. &#x201c;Believe me. I did everything I could to talk him out of this. But he&#x2019;d gotten it into his head that this was the way to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of challenge?&#x201d; Cara blurted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something along the lines of the twelve labors of Hercules would be my guess.&#x201d; Allie folded her arms over her chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Close, Allie. He wants the three of you to restore an old theater in his hometown. Together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Say that again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Restore a theater? Had he lost his mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete let the three of them vent for several minutes.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve finished with your rantings, I&#x2019;d like to continue.&#x201d; He glanced from Allie to Des to Cara and back again. When it appeared they&#x2019;d settled down, he continued. &#x201c;The theater was built by your great-grandfather Reynolds Hudson. It&#x2019;s an Art Deco treasure and belongs on the National Register of Historic Places...</p><h2>Leo Tolstoy: A Confession / The Gospel in Brief / What I Believe (World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This is Tolstoy&#39;s answer to the age old question of life&#39;s meaning. As he explains, &#34;...five years ago something very strange began to happen to me. At first I experienced moments of perplexity and arrest of life, as though I did not know what to do or how to live; and I felt lost and became dejected. But this passed and I went on living as before. Then these moments of perplexity began to recur oftener and oftener, and always in the same form. They were always expressed by the questions: What is it for? What does it lead to?&#34; Tolstoy recounts how he sought to resolve these questions in &#34;A Confession.&#34;</p><p><i>Confession</i> is Leo Tolstoy's memoir of midlife spiritual crisis. In 1879, having written <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>, the 51 year-old Tolstoy began to believe that his life was meaningless. <i>Confession</i> is his account of the limited satisfactions he derived from his aesthetic and intellectual triumphs, and of his first yearnings for real faith. This book marks the turning point in his career as a writer: after 1880 he would write almost exclusively about religious life, especially devotion among the peasantry (in works such as <i>The Death of Ivan Ilych</i> and <i>Resurrection</i>). Near the end of <i>Confession</i>, Tolstoy describes the desolation he felt upon deciding that he could not solve his crisis of faith by taking refuge in the church. "I have no doubt that there is truth in the doctrine," he writes, "but there can also be no doubt that it harbors a lie; and I must find the truth and the lie so I can tell them apart." <i>Confession</i> does not find the full Truth, but it offers an inspiring example of a man rejecting the lies that cling to unthinking orthodoxy. Its final, exhilarating, heart-rending account of a spiritually awakening dream ranks with the best of Christian mystical writing. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>An account of a spiritual crisis, marking a shift of Tolstoy&#39;s central focus from the aesthetic to the religious and philosophical.</p><h2>Dilbert Gives You the Business (Dilbert Book)</h2><p>Everyone who reads DILBERT and works in an office will appreciate this collection, <i>Dilbert Gives You the Business.</i> <p></p>Creator Scott Adams tells it like it is through the insane business world inhabited by Dilbert.

The story is an epic brew of technology, magic, politics, history and entomology, by turns fiercely satiric and good-naturedly humorous. The narrative flits from the jungles of South America to the dusty plains of Afghanistan, the ice fields of Alaska, the streets of San Francisco and many other places, featuring as its principal theme a pitiless war between insects and the inventors of electricity (the distinction between man and insect being somewhat blurred). This battle takes place amid the semi-rational doings of revolutionaries, reactionaries, electrical engineers, prostitutes and social misfits. Some judgments may be ventured: that Vollmann's imagination is astounding; that his dark vision of a perpetually feuding world gives his novel artistic integrity; and that whatever his story may add up to, every page arrests and entertains.

With new, previously unpublished material, including the roll of honour and full schedules of citations, awards and Wings lists. Formed in 1973 in the war-ravaged Rhodesia, the Selous Scouts, in a few short years, established a fearsome reputation as one of the world&#39;s most daring, ruthless and imaginative counter-insurgency units. Fully multiracial, this regiment was to prove that black operatives were as effective as their white counterparts. Accounting for nearly 70 percent of enemy guerrilla casualties, directly and indirectly, the regiment faded away, a political embarrassment, at Zimbabwean independence in 1980. This is the definitive account of this legendary unit&#39;s history, written and compiled by the regiment&#39;s founder, Lieutenant-Colonel Ron Reid-Daly. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</p><p></p><h2>Cascadia&#39;s Fault: The Coming Earthquake and Tsunami that Could Devastate North America</h2><p>There&#x2019;s a crack in the earth&#x2019;s crust that runs roughly 31 miles offshore, approximately 683 miles from northern California up through Vancouver Island off the coast of British Columbia. The Cascadia Subduction Zone has generated massive earthquakes over and over again throughout geologic time at least 36 major events in the last 10,000 years. This fault generates a monster earthquake about every 500 years. And the monster is due to return at any time. It could happen 200 years from now, or it could be tonight.<br><br>The Cascadia Subduction Zone is virtually identical to the offshore fault that wrecked Sumatra in 2004. It will generate the same earthquake we saw in Sumatra, at magnitude 9 or higher, sending crippling shockwaves across a far wider area than any California quake. Slamming into Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Victoria, and Vancouver, it will send tidal waves to the shores of Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, damaging the economies of the Pacific Rim countries and their trading partners for years to come.<br><br>In light of recent massive quakes in Haiti, Chile, and Mexico, <i>Cascadia&#x2019;s Fault</i> not only tells the story of this potentially devastating earthquake and the tsunamis it will spawn, it also warns us about the impending crisis almost unprecedented in modern history.</p><p><b>Jerry Thompson</b> is an award-winning documentary filmmaker living outside of Vancouver. For twenty years, he worked as a as a network news correspondent and a documentary film producer for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He has written articles for <i>Equinox</i> and <i>Vancouver</i> magazine, and has produced and narrated a half-dozen highly regarded television documentary specials on Cascadia&#x2019;s fault that received wide critical praise.The recent seismic catastrophe in Japan is a foretaste of a similar cataclysm brewing in America, according to this alarming geological expos�. Thompson, a former Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter and documentarian, investigates the Cascadia Subduction Zone, an 800-mile-long fault where the ocean floor slowly grinds away underneath the North American continental plate. The fault has a millennia-long history of causing major quakes, including magnitude-9 monsters and 90-foot waves that could lay waste to Vancouver, Seattle, and dozens of coastal towns. But because no written records of this history exist and the fault has been quiescent since 1700, geologists were unaware of the danger. How they uncovered the violent history of this deceptively placid area, long a subject of academic controversy, is the fascinating scientific detective story at the heart of Thompson's account. He follows along as researchers piece together clues from ocean sediment core samples and tree rings, antique Japanese manuscripts, and laser gadgets and GPS devices that measure the inch-a-year movements of mountain chains; he blanches as their computer models illustrate the devastating impact of tsunamis and the fatal rhythms through which skyscrapers resonate to a temblor's shocks. The result is a lucid, engrossing look at the Earth's subtle dynamics&#x2014;and a timely warning about their awesome power very close to home. (June)</p><h2>Enigma Variations: A Novel</h2><p><p>Andr� Aciman, hailed as a writer of &#x201c;fiction at its most supremely interesting&#x201d; (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>), has written a novel that charts the life of a man named Paul, whose loves remain as consuming and as covetous throughout his adulthood as they were in his adolescence. Whether the setting is southern Italy, where as a boy he has a crush on his parents&#x2019; cabinetmaker, or a snowbound campus in New England, where his enduring passion for a girl he&#x2019;ll meet again and again over the years is punctuated by anonymous encounters with men; whether he&#x2019;s on a tennis court in Central Park, or on a New York sidewalk in early spring, his attachments are ungraspable, transient, and forever underwritten by raw desire&#x2015;not for just one person&#x2019;s body but, inevitably, for someone else&#x2019;s as well.</p><p>In <i>Enigma Variations</i>, Aciman maps the most inscrutable corners of passion, proving to be an unsparing reader of the human psyche and a master stylist. With language at once lyrical, bare-knuckled, and unabashedly candid, he casts a sensuous, shimmering light over each facet of desire to probe how we ache, want, and waver, and ultimately how we sometimes falter and let go of those who may want to offer only what we crave from them. Ahead of every step Paul takes, his hopes, denials, fears, and regrets are always ready to lay their traps. Yet the dream of love lingers. We may not always know what we want. We may remain enigmas to ourselves and to others. But sooner or later we discover who we&#x2019;ve always known we were.</p></p><p><b>Andr</b><b>�</b><b> Aciman</b> is the author of <i>Eight White Nights</i>, <i>Call Me by Your Name</i>, <i>Out of Egypt</i>, <i>False Papers</i>, <i>Alibis,</i> and <i>Harvard Square</i>, and the editor of <i>The Proust Project</i> (all published by FSG). He teaches comparative literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and lives with his wife in Manhattan.<p>"Aciman writes arousal so beautifully you miss it when it's gone . . . [Aciman is] up to something bolder this time . . . Aciman is all the way himself here. He writes with the ferocity of a writer who's finally getting his vision down, and he has to say it, has to get it out. He's made a magnificent, living thing." &#x2015;Paul Lisicky, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"A breathless, sketched rendering of one man&#x2019;s life in love, Aciman&#x2019;s novel speaks earnestly not only of longing and lust, but also of more complicated emotions . . . [Aciman] portrays Paul convincingly as a sensuous and self-aware figure, forever treading the border between melodrama and tragedy." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Is there any writer out there who can conjure the seismic swings and loop-the-loop giddiness of sexual infatuation the way that Andr� Aciman can? He first revealed this talent in his debut novel, <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>, the book that sealed his reputation along with his sublime memoir, <i>Out of Egypt</i> . . . The allure of <i>Enigma Variations</i> rests in its agile sense of the heart&#x2019;s paradoxes and might-have-beens." &#x2015;Michael Upchurch, <i>Boston Globe</i></p></p><h2>Keith Haring: Journals</h2><p>His own words and artwork follow the evolution of the late artist, from early chalk sketches to massive steel sculptures, in a volume illustrated with previously unpublished drawings from his notebooks. 25,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo.

I don&#x2019;t know what I want or how to get it. Iact like I know what I want, and I appear to be going after it&#x2014;fast,but I don&#x2019;t, when it comes down to it, even know. I guess it&#x2019;s becauseI&#x2019;m afraid. Afraid I&#x2019;m wrong. And I guess I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;mwrong, because I constantly relate myself to other people, otherexperiences, other ideas. I should be looking at both in perspective,not comparing. I relate my life to an idea or an example thatis some entirely different life. I should be relating it to my life onlyin the sense that each has good and bad facets. Each is separate.The only way the other attained enough merit, making it worthyof my admiration, or long to copy it is by taking chances, taking itin its own way. It has grown with different situations and has discovereddifferent heights of happiness and equal sorrows. If I always seek to pattern my life after another, mine is beingwasted re-doing things for my own empty acceptance. But, ifI live my life my way and only let the other [artists] influenceme as a reference, a starting point, I can build an even higherawareness instead of staying dormant. If I can take this andapply it, it will help, but again I am afraid. Afraid I&#x2019;ll just ignorethis whole revelation and remain in the rut and rationalizeand call it human nature or some shit. But, I&#x2019;ve beenliving like this for so long that it seems I&#x2019;m doomed to continue.Although I realized it now, so that is encouraging. If Ican do this, then it should not be hard to answer my questionsand doubts about my forthcoming adventure.

They have a big librarywith &#x201c;Pioneer&#x201d; receivers, tape decks and a large selection ofmusic (even Frank Zappa).

We drove till around 10:00 last night andthen stayed in a motel, watched <i>Paper Moon </i> on TV and tookshowers.

Then we wentby Rapid Transit (space transit) to San Francisco to a placeto eat and sleep for free advertised in an &#x201c;alternative&#x201d; YellowPages we found in Berkeley.

But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In the alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child&#39;s autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.</p><p>Keiko Tobe was an acclaimed Japanese manga artist whose masterwork <i>With the Light</i> strove to bring the everyday struggles of raising a child with autism to a wider audience. <i>With the Light</i> earned her the Japan Media Arts<em></em> Festival's Manga Division Excellence Prize in 2004, and the series was also adapted into a critically-acclaimed drama series in Japan.Potentially one of the most significant mangas in years, this engrossing book is certainly one of the most unusual: a long, realistically drawn narrative about a young couple coping with the discovery that their infant son is autistic. Masato and Saachiko Azuma need time to realize that their beautiful little boy, Hikaru, is unable to communicate personally. The official diagnosis of autism confuses and devastates the parents. Masato dives headlong into his career to avoid home; Sachiko is angry at Hikaru's behavior, but also tormented by guilt that she's somehow to blame. As they learn and experience more, they become closer to Hikaru and each other. They meet helpful allies, collide with ignorant hostility and savor glimpses through cracks in Hikaru's shell. They become a family. As this volume ends, the three of them are adjusting to a new family member&#x2014;Hikaru's normal little sister. The story works as a comic. too; fluid layout keeps the action moving through pages of talking-head conversations, and the childish innocence of manga characters has never been more appropriate. Just as Tom Batiuk used breast cancer as a basis for his outstanding <i>Lisa's Story</i>, so <i>With the Light</i> also offers a moving, artistically successful experience. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They already know how we met, of course. But that won&#x2019;t be why they&#x2019;re asking. It never is.</p> <p>I remember when Luke was training, he told me that you only ever ask a question if you already know the answer. Lawyers don&#x2019;t like surprises, least of all when they&#x2019;re on the record. So they won&#x2019;t be asking because they want to know the date, the time, the address, all the little details. They will have done their homework, I&#x2019;m sure. They&#x2019;ve spoken to Robert, my old boss, already. So they know when I arrived in Edinburgh, and which day I started work. They probably have a copy of my timetable. If they wanted to, they could pinpoint our first meeting to the minute.</p> <p>They won&#x2019;t be asking because they want to know what I&#x2019;ll say, they&#x2019;ll just want to know how I say it. Will my eyes go right or left? Am I remembering, or inventing? They&#x2019;ll be measuring my truth against the one they&#x2019;ve built from other witnesses. Gauging whether I can be trusted, or whether I&#x2019;m a liar.</p> <p>So when they ask, I&#x2019;m not going to roll my eyes and tell them they&#x2019;re wasting my time. I&#x2019;m not going to tell them that I can hardly bear to go over this again, that every time someone asks me, I have to live through it all over again. I&#x2019;m not going to ask if they know what it feels like, holding up the weight of everything that happened. I won&#x2019;t make a fuss. It wouldn&#x2019;t help.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m going to take a small breath, look straight ahead, and tell them the truth. I can&#x2019;t get nervous and start rattling on about how I didn&#x2019;t plan to be in Edinburgh. I won&#x2019;t ask them to remember what had happened to me, and why I&#x2019;d had to run away from London, why I was in Scotland at all. I won&#x2019;t remind them that I could have had no inkling of how terribly things would turn out. Besides, even if I had, I wouldn&#x2019;t have cared. I didn&#x2019;t care about anything then.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m just going to answer as simply as I can: I met them on the 6th of January 2011, in the basement room at 58 Rankeillor Street. And I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed any of them could do something so monstrous.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>That isn&#x2019;t quite true, of course. Even by the standards of the Unit, they were a difficult group. But Robert had warned me that they would be challenging, so my expectations were low.</p> <p>I went to meet Robert the day before term began, at the pupil referral unit on Rankeillor Street. The building was empty except for the two of us, but I had to pick up forms and files and registration lists, most of which were covered in Post-it notes linking children&#x2019;s names to medical conditions. At first glance, at least half of them were allergic to something: nuts, pollen, air pollution, gluten, mould spores.</p> <p>&#x2018;They don&#x2019;t seem very sturdy,&#x2019; I pointed out, skimming the top few pages Robert had just given me. His office was a huge, high-ceilinged room whose elegant proportions had been sliced in two by a partition wall. One half had been converted into his secretary&#x2019;s office. It was lined with filing cabinets from the door all the way to the far wall. In front of these stood her symmetrical desk: a computer in one corner was matched in the opposite one by three wire trays balanced on top of one another and marked &#x2018;In&#x2019;, &#x2018;Out&#x2019; and &#x2018;Pending&#x2019;; all of them were empty. Next to them was a picture of two young children, dark-haired and grinning in front of a loch in the pouring rain. The frame was clearly handmade &#x2013; in bright, misshapen purple clay &#x2013; presumably by one of the children it contained.</p> <p>Robert&#x2019;s office was the yin to Cynthia&#x2019;s yang. Bulging files were piled up on every flat surface, including the floor. Torn scraps of paper with names or initials were balanced on top of them. Where Cynthia&#x2019;s only light source was the greenish long-life bulb overhead, Robert&#x2019;s room had two huge sash windows which looked out onto Rankeillor Street. Look up to the left, and you could see Salisbury Crags, the dark cliffs which glower down over Edinburgh, reminding you that there will be no nonsense here. The windows were framed with thick, theatrical curtains, their dark crimson folds coated with a thin film of dust, through which narrow, wandering tracks of curtain showed. Someone had taken an erratic vacuum cleaner to them but had lost the will before victory could be claimed.</p> <p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t believe a word of it,&#x2019; he panted, as he hunted around the desk, the table and the mantelpiece over the long-dead fireplace, trying to make sure he had gathered everything with &#x2018;Alex&#x2019; or &#x2018;A.M.&#x2019; written on or near it. &#x2018;I mean, do believe it,&#x2019; he corrected himself. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t test them by throwing peanuts at them, or asking an asthmatic one to run up the stairs. But rest assured, Alex, these children will not be felled by a mere allergen. These details come up when they&#x2019;re assessed by doctors and social workers, of course, for their specific educational needs and challenges, and we have to keep full records of everything, even if it seems trivial. I doubt,&#x2019; he glanced down at the file he was holding, &#x2018;if Jenny Stratton will meet a sticky end from her lychee allergy in your classroom. You&#x2019;d have to go a long way to find a lychee anywhere in this city, come to that. It makes you wonder how they found out she was allergic at all. Most of them will be fine when they get to know you. Some of them might be less keen on doing drama or dramatherapy than others. Some of them are very confident, some are, you know, shyer.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;How many kids do you have here?&#x2019; I asked him, looking at the paper chaos. There couldn&#x2019;t possibly be room in the building &#x2013; a vast converted terraced house spread over four floors, its yellow bricks blackened with dirt &#x2013; for the number of children needed to generate this many forms.</p> <p>&#x2018;There are about thirty of them here at any one time, but they come and go, obviously. New children will be referred here from about the second week of term, I expect. And we&#x2019;ll lose some of these ones as we go along.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Lose them?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Rankeillor Street is a charity. Children come here when nowhere else will take them. Thanks to our benefactors, we can take a few children out of the system which is failing them. Most of them have been expelled from at least one school, though we do take some children before that point.&#x2019; He began hunting around for something under the papers on his desk. &#x2018;Their parents or guardians apply to us, and if we think we can help, genuinely help, we try and make space for them. Our admissions procedure was enshrined in the original gift of the building and the fund: we don&#x2019;t take children who are simply struggling academically. There are plenty of other options available to them. Not all of them are good options, I know, but they do exist.&#x2019;</p> <p>He eventually found what he was looking for &#x2013; a battered biro, which he used to scrawl a note on the file he held in his left hand. He didn&#x2019;t even pause while he was writing. &#x2018;We take the ones who don&#x2019;t function well elsewhere, for whatever reason: they&#x2019;ve been bullied, or they are bullies, or they don&#x2019;t fit in, or whatever. The ones for whom we might actually be able to make a difference. But our aim is to get these children back into mainstream schools, if we possibly can. So really, we&#x2019;re trying to get rid of them as soon as they get here. And sometimes it works, but not always. We also lose some because they can&#x2019;t function here any more successfully than they did at other schools. Even safety nets have holes in them, you know.&#x2019;</p> <p>I nodded, wondering what he meant. Robert had always been like this: he tended to assume you were more attuned to his thought processes than you actually were. Than I actually was, anyway.</p> <p>&#x2018;Not usually more than one or two each term,&#x2019; he added. &#x2018;Unless it&#x2019;s a very bad term.&#x2019;</p> <p>He looked over his half-moon spectacles at the papers I was now trying to arrange into a coherent order. &#x2018;This class,&#x2019; he reached over and prodded one of the pages with the wrong end of his pen, &#x2018;will probably be the most difficult for you.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Why?&#x2019; The sheet listed only five names, a small class of fourth-years. I did the maths in my head: fifteen years old. He handed me three more files, which I slotted in to what seemed to be a sensible order. If I could control the paperwork, perhaps I could control a classroom. I now had one set of files for each class, and one class for each year-group, five in total. Looking at the lists of unfamiliar names, I wondered how long it would take to match them to children. Robert didn&#x2019;t answer the question.</p> <p>&#x2018;I think that&#x2019;s the last of them, Alex,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t lie to you. They can be right little fuckers. But don&#x2019;t worry. You&#x2019;ll win them over in the end. I&#x2019;m not giving you every sentence we have on every child: it&#x2019;ll just stress you out, thinking you need to read it all. You have everything you need here. If you feel like you&#x2019;re at sea with a particular student, come and ask for their full file; Cynthia will have a copy you can read. These children deserve to be more than their records, though, so please don&#x2019;t ask unless you really need to know something.&#x2019;</p> <p>I wanted to ask him what kind of information might be in the files which I didn&#x2019;t have, but he had already skipped on to talk about something else. Butterfly-brained, my mother would have called him: always lighting upon one topic, then fluttering off to another one before you could catch up. It should have been infuriating, but his enthusiasm was always so complete that he made you want to race to catch up with him instead of sulking that he&#x2019;d gone off without you. He had always been like that, even when I was a student and he was teaching drama over in the University buildings on George Square, less than a mile from where I now sat perched on the balding arm of his tweed-covered chair. He was the teacher you always hope for: passionate, exciting, funny. His chubby frame gave him a cuddly appearance that he only fulfilled if you handed work in on time, fully referenced and neatly printed out. Though his reddish hair had now faded to a sandy grey, and his face had creased into a few more lines, he still looked like the actor he had been in his youth. Even today, before the Unit was officially open, he was wearing a three-piece suit with a tartan waistcoat, as though he might be a wedding baritone, temporarily missing the rest of his choir. And this was him dressed down. I looked at my jeans, which were now covered with specks of white paper, shed from the papers I held, like tiny dirty confetti.</p> <p>&#x2018;Let me show you your classroom,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Leave those.&#x2019; He pointed at the files, then looked round his office, trying to find an empty spot. &#x2018;Perhaps put them on Cynthia&#x2019;s desk,&#x2019; he said more quietly, as if she might appear and berate him. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure she wouldn&#x2019;t mind. Just for now.&#x2019;</p> <p>I dusted them off with my sleeve before placing them on her desk, then followed him out of the room. He took me down the two flights of stairs to the ground floor, then down again to the basement, and what was now my room. The stairs grew darker as we reached the hallway at the bottom. Two scratchy yellow bulbs threw a thin light onto the final steps and the industrial-green classroom door. It was like climbing down into a cold swamp. Edinburgh in the winter is dingy enough without going underground. It was barely warmer in the damp hallway than it was outside, in the sleeting rain.</p> <p>&#x2018;The kids like it down here,&#x2019; he said, opening the door and stepping to one side so I could walk in. For a man who had once done a season at the RSC (one up from spear-carrying, darling, but it still counts), he was a terrible liar.</p> <p>At least my predecessor had tried to make the place cosy. The back wall was a fiery orange, and the radiators were turned up to their highest setting, so the room itself was relatively dry. But the air smelled sourly of mildew, and as I scanned the warped doors of the cupboards which ran along the wall under the windows at the front of the building, I guessed that if I opened them, the smell would be stronger still.</p> <p>The room was huge, easily bigger than the one-bedroom flat I was staying in down the road. It ran under the whole building, which had to compensate for standing on a hill. The windows at the back looked out over a yard which must have replaced the garden when the house had been converted into a pupil referral unit. Guessing from the litter, it was now mainly used for smoking. But at the front, where the ground had snuck up underneath it, the window looked out onto a whitewashed wall with a small door on one side. I noticed a large, dented keyhole and wondered if the door still opened. I had a brief vision of being locked in there by a class of jeering children who hated me, and shuddered. It had probably once been the coal-cellar, I supposed.</p> <p>Way above head-height you could see the thick layer of pebbles in the space between the gate onto the street and the steps up to the front door of the building. I could just see the bottom of a few sorry shrubs in pots, which did nothing to change the Unit&#x2019;s unloved face. Like so many buildings in Edinburgh, it was grand but tired at the same time.</p> <p>Robert flicked the light switch next to the door and three weary lamps flickered on overhead, two over the chairs and tables at the front end of the room and one more over the dingy, empty space towards the back. I blinked, wondering if bulbs came in a lower wattage than forty, and if they did, why someone would use them in a classroom.</p> <p>&#x2018;Carole &#x2013; your predecessor &#x2013; probably did most of her teaching here,&#x2019; he said, pointing towards the chairs. I nodded. If she wanted to make out the kids through the gloom, she would have had to. Even in the summer, I would discover, the lights needed to be on in this room. How on earth had Carole taught art lessons in here? Why hadn&#x2019;t she asked for more lights to be fitted?</p> <p>The chairs were old and mismatched. A battered brown leather chair stood behind the teacher&#x2019;s desk, my desk, and the rest were fabric-covered in grimy reds, purples and maroons. The walls were decorated with bright collages and paintings, made by the children last term, I supposed. But the corners were already peeling up from the bottom of each picture, as though the room were trying to rid itself of any signs of life.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The following afternoon I was sitting in the basement, waiting for them. I&#x2019;d taught three classes that morning, which had gone relatively well, considering that it was three years since I&#x2019;d finished my PGCE. I&#x2019;d run quite a few theatre workshops for children in the meantime, but I hadn&#x2019;t taught, properly taught, a single lesson since I&#x2019;d qualified. I knew perfectly well that if Robert hadn&#x2019;t been my friend, I would never have got a job at Rankeillor Street &#x2013; on merit, or experience. How many people are given a job on the strength of a phone call? Robert had blustered something about an unexpected vacancy and short-term contracts being hard to fill, but he could easily have found someone better than me. I couldn&#x2019;t even bring myself to feel guilty about all the people he must have overlooked.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d met the rest of the Unit&#x2019;s staff over lunch upstairs, as they gossiped over sandwiches and microwaved pots of soup. One thing was clear: the class Robert had warned me about was indeed unpopular with almost every teacher. Eyes rolled when I asked why they were so much worse than the other kids. &#x2018;How long have you got?&#x2019; snapped one irritable woman, settling herself against a cushion before she began her litany. But Robert, whose bat-like ears missed nothing, swooped in and told everyone to stop frightening me.</p> <p>&#x2018;If she leaves,&#x2019; he hissed, &#x2018;someone&#x2019;s going to have to cover her classes.&#x2019; He looked round at the rest of the staff. &#x2018;All her classes,&#x2019; he emphasised.</p> <p>S...</p></p><h2>Live from Beach City!

Invisible Ink unfolds like a detective story, alternating between past and present, as Griffith recreates the quotidian habits of suburban Levittown and the professional and cultural life of mid-century Manhattan in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s as seen through his mother&#x2019;s and his own then-teenage eyes. Griffith puts the pieces together and reveals a mother he never knew.</p><p>Bill Griffith is the artist behind the legendary weekly comic Zippy. Griffith&#39;s prolific output has been included in such publications as the Village Voice, National Lampoon, and the New Yorker. Along with Art Spiegelman, Griffith co-founded the influential anthology Arcade and is credited for coining the popular phrase, &#34;Are we Having Fun Yet?&#34; He currently lives in Connecticut with his wife, the cartoonist Diane Noomin.&#x201c;<strong>Starred Review</strong>: [Griffith's] intricate drawing style, which exploits a range of backdrops, from blank to near-photorealistic depictions of architecture, complements the richness of hisverbal narration and the veracity and particularity of the dialogue he creates for the many relatives andfamily friends he portrays ... [A]bsorbing and moving.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ray Olson, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This autobiographical story by the creator of Zippy the Pinhead will ring true to anyone who has ever watched their parents&#x2019; marital misery around the dinner table and wondered what was really going on. ... Weaving a tapestry of family dysfunction and clandestine liaisons set against the backdrop of the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, Griffith&#x2019;s... archaeology of his family&#x2019;s past is an evocative portrait of postwar America.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Already a pioneer of underground comix, and perhaps the last great daily comic strip artist (his <em>Zippy the Pinhead</em> carries giddily on), Bill Griffith now earns yet another distinction, as memoirist.&nbsp;<em>Invisible Ink</em>&nbsp;is a dense, digressive personal essay that tries to understand the fading world of his parents &#x2013; especially his mother, an irrepressible and adventurous soul ... [W]ith his meticulous, etching-like drawings and conversational tone, Bill Griffith imagines his mother&#x2019;s ambitions and passions with empathy and stirring respect.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sean Rogers, <em>The Globe and Mail</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Employing a jauntily crosshatched style, Griffith zigzags through recollections of a Long Island youth and a postwar mom conflicted enough to beam over her son's success in underground comics... but to refuse to show his work to her friends for 'fear that people may say to me, "Your son draws dirty pictures."' Here, when Griffith draws his mother having sex with her illicit lover, the pictures are not dirty; they're heartbreaking.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>R.C.

It&#x2019;s the best work so far by an artist who has given us decades of superlative work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Tumey, <em>The Comics Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Invisible Ink</em>] is an elegant, serious, well-crafted book from an artist who works with a kind of serious fury that's kept him going for years and years now.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tom Spurgeon, <em>The Comics Reporter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>What makes this story extraordinary is that Bill Griffith has definitely met his match with his mother who gives his storytelling skills a run for their money.

She paused, still on the granite steps, touched the brim of her hat and the flying hem of her skirt--felt the wind rush up her cuffs and rattle her sleeves.<br>&nbsp;<br>And all before her, the lunch-hour crowd bent under the April sun and into the bitter April wind, jackets flapping and eyes squinting, or else skirts pressed to the backs of legs and jacket hems pressed to bottoms. And trailing them, outrunning them, skittering along the gutter and the sidewalk and the low gray steps of the church, banging into ankles and knees and one another, scraps of paper, newspapers, candy wrappers, what else?--office memos? shopping lists? The paper detritus that she had somewhere read, or had heard it said, trails armies, or was it (she had seen a photograph) the scraps of letters and wrappers and snapshots that blow across battlefields after all but the dead have fled?<br>&nbsp;<br>She squinted against the sunlight on taxi hoods and bus windows, heard the rushing now of air and of taxis, wheezing buses, and underneath it all something banging--a loosened street sign, a trapped can, a distant hammer--rhythmic and methodical. The march of time.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then George approaching, his hand stuck to his hat and the hat bent into the onslaught. She went down the steps just in front of him, drawn more by forward momentum than by any desire to meet up with, or to avoid, her brother's latest best pal.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cold wind made it difficult to breathe, as if it could snatch your next breath before you had time to swallow it, and she bent her head, too, hand to her hat, submerged in wind and beginning to imagine herself slowly losing ground with each step forward, slowly beginning to stall, and then to sail backward--a quick scramble to regain ground and then another sailing backward. In church she had prayed for contentment. She was thirty, with no husband in sight. A good job, an aging father, a bachelor brother, a few nice friends. At least, she had asked--so humbly, so earnestly, so seriously--let me be content.<br>&nbsp;<br>And now a slapstick windstorm fit for Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was either God's reply or just April again, in the wind tunnel that was midtown Manhattan. The scent of it, the Easter scent of April in the city, all around her, in the cold air itself as well as on the shoulders of the crowd; the smell of sunlight and dirt, something warming at the heart of it all.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then she felt his hand on her shoulder and he shouted, "Mary Rose," which bound him forever to her brother and her father and her life at home since nowhere else did she tolerate the double name. His head was still lowered, his hand still on his hat--he might have been waiting for the right opportunity to doff it--and he peered around at her from under its brim as if from under the rock of another life.<br>&nbsp;<br>And she, her hand on the back of her own hat, did the same.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hello, George," she said. She could feel the crunch of city grit between her back teeth.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Some wind," he said. He had one eye closed against it, the other was watery.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're telling me," she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>They walked together to the corner and as they stepped off the curb, he suddenly reached up and took her raised elbow--the one that led to the hand she held against her hat--and kept it between his fingers as they crossed. She thought he must look like a man attached to a subway strap. At the next corner, he did the same; a gesture that was either brotherly or proprietary, but awkward either way, as if one of them were blind or doddering, or as if both were involved in some odd, raised-elbow folk dance. At Forty-sixth, the light was against them and the wind paused enough for her to take her hand off her hat while they waited with the crowd.<br>&nbsp;<br>She turned to him--was he going to speak? His eyes were teary from the wind, red-rimmed and bloodshot. His nose was running and there were tears on his windblown cheeks. She clicked open the purse that hung on her arm and found her handkerchief, but he refused it, reaching into his overcoat for his own. He mopped his face and blew his nose before the crowd got them moving again and as they got to the curb, she placed her left hand on her hat so he could reach her elbow at a more convenient angle--which he did, guiding her across the street as if she were a novice pedestrian, and this time, perhaps, putting a little more pressure behind the fingertips that held her.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Where are you headed, George?" she asked him. He shouted something unintelligible into the wind.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Have you eaten yet?" she asked, because it was only polite. And then the wind paused completely, as it will in April, a sudden silence and maybe even the hint of warmth from the sun, so that he replied with odd gentleness, "Yeah, I had my lunch."<br>&nbsp;<br>They were at the door of the restaurant. The wind was picking up again. "Would you like some coffee?" she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>He shook his head and she could not deny her own relief. "I'm out of time," he said. And then added, "What about dinner?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Lamb chops," she told him. "You coming over?" Anticipating already a stop at the butcher's to pick up two or three more.<br>&nbsp;<br>He shook his head. There was another tear streaming down his windblown cheek and as he replied she lifted the handkerchief in her hand and wiped it away, feeling the not unpleasant pull of his beard against the thin cotton.<br>&nbsp;<br>He said, "I mean, what about us having dinner?"<br>&nbsp;<br>The wind puffed up again and they both put their hands to their hats. "Where?" she said, rudely, she realized later. But it was like having a passing stranger suddenly turn to sing you an aria. Anyone would have a second or two of not quite knowing what was really going on.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Out," he told her. He was a broad-faced man who looked good in hats. Who looked better now than he did at home, where he had been thus far only the unremarkable source of her brother Jimmy's unpredictable enthusiasms. "At a restaurant," he said. And then to make himself clearer, "The two of us."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tonight?" she said, and then they both turned away for a moment from the peppered wind. When they turned back, he said, "Why not?" but without conviction, confirming for them both that this was a sudden impulse that most likely would not last out the afternoon. "What if I come by at seven?" he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She paused, squinting, not for the chance to see him better but for him to see her. "I'll have to cook those lamb chops anyway," she said. "Or else Jimmy and my father will be gnawing the table legs by the time I get home."<br>&nbsp;<br>He smiled a little, unable to disguise what she was sure was a bit of confusion about his own impulse. He said again, "I'll come by at seven," and then turned back into the wind.<br>&nbsp;<br>She pushed open the door to the restaurant. More lunchtime bustle, mostly women in hats with their coats thrown over the backs of chairs, the satiny linings and the fur collars and cuffs, the perfume and the elegant curves of the women's backs as they leaned forward across the small tables, all giving the hint of a boudoir to the busy place. She found a seat at the counter, wiggled her way into it. Saw the man beside her who was finishing a cigarette give her a quick up and down from over his shoulder and then turn back to flick an ash onto the remains of his sandwich. She imagined returning his dismissive stare, and then maybe even letting her eyes linger distastefully on the crust of bread and the bitten dill pickle and the cigarette debris on his plate. She could slide the ashtray that was right there between them a little closer to his elbow--hint, hint. Emboldened, perhaps--was she?--by the fact that she'd just been asked out on a date.<br>&nbsp;<br>She ordered a sandwich from the waitress, whose pretty youth was still evident in the doughy folds of her weary and aging face, and a cup of tea. And then she held her hands over the steaming water for a few seconds. Thin hands, long fingers, with a kind of transparency to the chapped skin. Her mother's gold ring, inset with a silver Miraculous Medal, on her right hand. The man beside her rubbed his cigarette into the plate, then stood, swinging away from her on the stool and causing a slight ripple through the customers all along the other side of him. He took his overcoat from the hat rack and put it on standing just behind her, and then leaned across his empty stool, brushing her arm, to leave a few coins under his plate.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Overcoats in April," he said. "Some crazy weather."<br>&nbsp;<br>She turned to him, out of politeness, the habit of it. "I've never seen such wind," she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was handsome enough--dark eyes and a nice chin, though his hair was thinning. He wore a dark overcoat and a dark suit, a white shirt and a tie, and there was the worn shine of a brass belt buckle as he reached for his wallet. "Reminds me of some days we had overseas," he said, taking a bill from his billfold.<br>&nbsp;<br>She frowned, reflexively. "Where were you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>He shook his head, smiled at her. Something in his manner seemed to indicate that they knew each other, that they'd had such conversations before. "In another life," he said and snapped the bill and slapped the wallet and returned it to his pocket with a wink that said, But all that's behind us now, isn't it? He was thin and his stomach was taut and his starched white shirt was smooth against his chest and belly. The brass belt buckle, marked with decorative lines, a circled initial at its center, was worn to a warm gold. "Once more into the breach," he said, turning up his collar. "Wish me luck."<br>&nbsp;<br>...</p><h2>Penguin English Library Washington Square</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of Washington Square by James Hardy &#34;Why, you must take me or leave me ... You can&#39;t please your father and me both; you must choose between us&#34; When timid and plain Catherine Sloper acquires a dashing and determined suitor, her father, convinced that the young man is nothing more than a fortune-hunter, decides to put a stop to their romance. Torn between her desire to win her father&#39;s love and approval and her passion for the first man who has ever declared his love for her, Catherine faces an agonising dilemma, and becomes all too aware of the restrictions that others seek to place on her freedom. James&#39;s masterly novel deftly interweaves the public and private faces of nineteenth-century New York society; it is also a deeply moving study of innocence destroyed. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Henry James was born in 1843 in New York and died in London in 1916. In addition to many short stories, plays, books of criticism, autobiography and travel, he wrote some twenty novels, the first published being Roderick Hudson (1875). They include The Europeans, Washington Square, The Portrait of a Lady, The Bostonians, The Princess Casamassima, The Tragic Muse, The Spoils of Poynton, The Awkward Age, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors and The Golden Bowl.</p><h2>Deadly Creatures Dictionary</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Alchemy: The Secret Art</h2><p><p>Alchemy: The Secret Art covers true alchemy vs false alchemy.

Tetsuya Wakuda is widely considered Australia&#39;s finest and most innovative chef-&#34;an Australian original&#34; according to the Wine Spectator, &#34;whose bold creativity and impeccable technique have won him admirers the world over.&#34; From his eponymous restaurant in Sydney, Tetsuya sends forth amazing eight- and thirteen-course menu d�gustations that captivate his guests, and even inspire the likes of Charlie Trotter to superlatives. In his long-awaited first book, Tetsuya now shares his inspiring story, legendary recipes, and his passion for the finer things in life. Marking the 10th anniversary of his restaurant, TETSUYA presents the master chef&#39;s unique cuisine, a winning combination of Japanese minimalism, the techniques of traditional French training, and a commitment to using the freshest ingredients. From his signature dish of Confit of Ocean Trout with Fennel Salad to Checkerboard Tuan and Hamachi with Orange Oil, the Tetsuya experience-once available only to those lucky enough to dine in his restaurant- can now be cherished at dinner tables the world over.</p><p>Tetsuya Wakuda is a true artist. Inspired by the ingredients native to his adopted country (Australia) and the techniques and flavors of his birthplace (Japan), Tetsuya combines them to complement and highlight each other in the simplest ways to bring out the most complicated flavors. For those of us unfamiliar with his reputation, <i>Tetsuya</i> comes with a glowing forward by Charlie Trotter that refers to Tetsuya in the same breath as Alain Ducasse, Daniel Boulud, and Thomas Keller, and rightly so.<p> Tetsuya's presentation is perfection. Details like minute brunoise and matchstick julienne are beautiful to behold, but it's his ethereal marinades and his thoughtful use of ingredients like fresh ginger, garlic, soy, mirin, and wasabi that make his dishes so memorable, and that allow us mere mortals to follow his recipes successfully. At Tetsuya, meals are presented as numerous small dishes, but you can multiply any of his recipes to work as main courses. Linguine with a Ragout of Oriental Mushrooms is simple to prepare and bursts with the rich, earthy flavor of exotic mushrooms brightened by hints of garlic, sake, mirin, tomato, and chile. Tartare of Tuna with Goat Cheese requires sushi-quality tuna, so if you can get it, this dish is quick and easy and luscious with fresh, creamy goat cheese and lively with cayenne, garlic, ginger, white pepper, and anchovies. Not all of Tetsuya's creations are Asian influenced. There are many magnificent European-style dishes, like a Salad of Sea Scallops with Asparagus and Beans, Venison with Roasted Shallots and Morels, and Granny Smith Apple Sorbet with Sauternes Jelly. </p><p> Stunning photographs of dreamy dishes and delightful bits of commentary separate recipes laid out like poetry to make this a culinary page-turner and a gift-worthy book. Without a doubt, <i>Tetsuya</i> would make an exciting addition to the kitchen collection of gourmets who love to cook with ingredients like market-fresh produce, sushi-quality fish and shellfish, fresh venison, squab, and guinea fowl. <i>--Leora Y. Bloom</i></p>TETSUYA WAKUDA grew up in Hamamatsu, a town in the prefecture of Shizuoka on Honshu in Japan. In 1982, he moved to Sydney, Australia, where he began his cooking career. He opened Tetsuya&#39;s in 1989, and it quickly became known as one of Australia&#39;s premier restaurants. Among many other awards, Tetsuya&#39;s was inducted into the American Express Hall of Fame in 1999.</p><h2>Prophecy: Book Five of The Blending</h2><p>In the epic conclusion of The Blending quintet, the Chosen Five--wielders of the elemental magic of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Spirit--battle sinister usurpers, an invading army, and a peasant rebellion to finally gain their rightful throne.

Robert B. Baer&#x2019;s boss at the CIA once told him, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bullet with a man&#x2019;s name on it.&#x201d; Sometimes assassination is the senseless act of a psychotic, a bloodletting without social value. Other times, it can be the sanest and most humane way to change the course of conflict&#x2014;one bullet, one death, case closed. Assassination has been dramatized by literature and politicized by infamous murders throughout history, and for Robert Baer, one of the most accomplished agents to ever work for the CIA, it&#x2019;s a source of endless fascination, speculation, and intrigue.<br><br>Over several decades, Baer served as an operative, from Iraq to New Delhi and beyond; notably, his career was the model for the acclaimed movie <i>Syriana.</i> In <i>The Perfect Kill</i>, he takes us on a serpentine adventure through the history of political murder; its connections to, and differences from, the ubiquitous use of drones in state-sponsored killing; his firsthand experience with political executions; and his decades-long cat-and-mouse hunt, across the Middle East and Europe, for the most effective and deadliest assassin of the modern age. A true maverick with an undeniably captivating personal story, Baer pulls back the curtain on the underbelly of world politics and the quiet murderers who operate on the fringe of our society.</p><p>ROBERT B. BAER is one of the most accomplished agents in CIA history, and a winner of the Career Intelligence Medal. He is the author of four <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>See No Evil</i>&#x2014;the basis for the acclaimed film Syriana, which earned George Clooney an Oscar for his portrayal of Baer. He is considered one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on the Middle East and frequently appears on all major news outlets. Baer writes regularly for Time.com and has contributed to <i>Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i>. He is the current national security affairs analyst for CNN.Introduction<p>Buttonwillow, California, Fourth of July weekend, 2011: It&#x2019;s not even eleven a.m., and already it&#x2019;s more than a hundred degrees. There&#x2019;s some pewter crap in the air draped over the Central Valley like a dirty sheet. With a lane of the I-5 closed for construction, traffic&#x2019;s moving at an infuriating crawl. To relieve the monotony, we pull off for coffee.</p><p>While my wife and daughter order at Starbucks, I drive across the street to the Valero station. Waiting for a pump to free up, I check my cell phone to find a text message from a British journalist in Lebanon: &#x201c;Congrats. U just featured on Al-Manar during Nasrallah&#x2019;s speech defending the indictments.&#x201d;</p><p>I stare at my phone as if somehow the words are going to rearrange themselves so I don&#x2019;t figure into them. Getting mentioned in any context on Hezbollah&#x2019;s TV station is never a good thing. But &#x201c;featured&#x201d; on it can only spell some special doom.</p><p>Until al-Qaeda, Hezbollah had more American blood on its hands than anyone outside traditional war. In the eighties, Hezbollah blew up two of our embassies in Beirut; murdered the CIA chief there; and truck-bombed the Marine barracks near the airport, killing 241. They spread mayhem around the rest of the world, from Bangkok to Buenos Aires, from Paris to Berlin. As for &#x201c;Nasrallah,&#x201d; he&#x2019;s Hassan Nasrallah, the fierce, black-robed cleric who heads Hezbollah. He&#x2019;s a man as steeped in blood as any of his underlings.</p><p>The &#x201c;indictments&#x201d; are no mystery either. They refer to news leaks that the special tribunal for Lebanon is about to name four Hezbollah members in the assassination of Rafic Hariri, the billionaire and former Lebanese prime minister. His end came on Valentine&#x2019;s Day 2005, when a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-filled van into his convoy as it traveled through central Beirut, incinerating Hariri and twenty-one others. The business tycoon was a darling of the White House and Riyadh&#x2019;s royal palaces, and his murder rattled a lot of powerful people.</p><p>Since then, Hezbollah has tried everything to erase its fingerprints from Hariri&#x2019;s assassination, from murdering key investigators to putting forward a patsy to falsely claim responsibility. So forget what the journalist just texted me: Nasrallah was damning those indictments, not &#x201c;defending&#x201d; them. It&#x2019;s a difference of only a few letters, but one with potentially lethal consequences.</p><p>It&#x2019;s too late now, but the truth is I walked into this shitstorm on my own two feet and with eyes wide open. It was two years ago when The Hague called me out of the blue to pick my brain on Hariri&#x2019;s assassins. Finding I had a couple of ideas, they hired me as a consultant. They didn&#x2019;t seem to mind I was an ex&#x2013;CIA operative with a murky past. But idiot me failed to foresee Hezbollah would find out and squeeze it for all it was worth.</p><p>I call the British journalist in Lebanon, who gets right to it: Nasrallah railed against The Hague and everyone connected to it. He denied having anything to do with Hariri&#x2019;s murder, reassuring the flock that Hezbollah is the victim of a frame-up.</p><p>I picture Nasrallah unloading on The Hague in all of his righteous fury and outrage, not to mention with the awesome authority of a descendant of the Prophet, which Nasrallah believes he is. He&#x2019;s a mousy man with a fat salt-and-pepper beard and fish-cold eyes swimming behind clunky glasses, but the faithful pay rapt attention when he speaks.</p><p>The journalist says that halfway through the piece I make my appearance in the guise of a two-year-old TV clip. A voice-over narrator then comes on to accuse me of conspiring with The Hague to frame Hezbollah for Hariri. The motivation? We&#x2019;re both in it for Israel, the narrator says. Zionist lackeys.</p><p>The Brit: &#x201c;Listen to this.&#x201d;</p><p>To make certain Al-Manar&#x2019;s viewers know that I&#x2019;m not just any bastard CIA operative, the narrator &#x201c;reveals for the first time&#x201d; that I was behind an old CIA attempt on Lebanon&#x2019;s only ayatollah. Lest anyone forget that infamous moment, they run an archival clip of a neighborhood in flames, burning cars and bodies scattered everywhere. The car bomb missed the ayatollah but killed more than eighty people, women and children too.</p><p>The ayatollah, in fact, died of natural causes just a couple of years ago, but even today he possesses a vast, devout following, including hundreds of thousands here in the United States. (For some bizarre reason, many of them supposedly work in the used-car business.)</p><p>I&#x2019;m about to plead that I had nothing to do with trying to murder the ayatollah, but now I consider the possibility some sort of jihad might have been declared on me. If so, the faithful won&#x2019;t slow down long enough to consider it might be me who&#x2019;s being framed in order for Hezbollah to divert attention from its own bloodletting.</p><p>I swat away my rising paranoia by comforting myself with the thought that the Lebanese have a venerable history of smoothing over political violence by blaming it on hapless scapegoats, especially foreigners. But would they really bother with a doughy, has-been CIA agent driving to his in-laws&#x2019; for the Fourth of July? As I&#x2019;m about to point this out, the Brit chimes back in.</p><p>&#x201c;It gets worse.&#x201d;</p><p>Accompanied by some bizarre mix of timpani and a seriously warped version of Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s <i>1812 Overture</i>, the narrator&#x2019;s voice starts to quaver as he steadies himself to let viewers know that I once planned a crime even more heinous than the attempt on Lebanon&#x2019;s only ayatollah&#x2014;assassinating Hezbollah&#x2019;s revered bang man.</p><p>He was at the center of all of Hezbollah&#x2019;s mayhem-sowing: the Beirut embassy bombings, the Marines, the attacks in Buenos Aires and Bangkok. He captained the most ruthless guerrilla campaigns in modern history, obliging Israel to vacate Lebanon; it was the first time in that country&#x2019;s history that it gave up ground under fire. And by the way, in a fitting end, the man was assassinated in Damascus in 2008.</p><p>It was a biblical setback for Hezbollah, sort of as if the Jews had lost Moses crossing the Red Sea. Which makes him Hezbollah&#x2019;s greatest &#x201c;living martyr.&#x201d; Today his picture&#x2019;s up on giant placards all around Lebanon, his gravesite a shrine. They even built a museum dedicated to him. No one seemed to mind he was up to his lashes in blood, including Hariri&#x2019;s. The way these people look at him, he&#x2019;s their George Washington and Saint Francis all rolled into one, and that&#x2019;s damn well it.</p><p>It takes me a beat, but it starts to dawn on me just how deeply I&#x2019;ve waded into it now. I, indeed, had made a half-baked attempt on the man; I&#x2019;d even alluded to it in one of my books. But come on, it was a lifetime ago, it failed miserably, and not a hair on the man&#x2019;s head got touched.</p><p>Why would they resurrect it now?</p><p>My thoughts by now are flapping around like trapped birds. Are they trying to pin his assassination on me? I sweep the Valero station, stupidly expecting to catch some Hezbollah cutthroat creeping up to righteously slit the throat of the evil CIA operative.</p><p>I&#x2019;m about to tell the Brit I had nothing to do with murdering the man, but the connection&#x2019;s gone scratchy. I want to reach down the line and grab him by the throat to get his attention, but I settle for yelling at my cell phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Nasrallah should think about it the next time he goes around murdering people. He&#x2019;s the assassin, not me.&#x201d; Out of the corner of my eye, I catch a bug-eyed man on the other side of the pump in a strawberry baseball cap and khaki shorts. He&#x2019;s stopped licking his ice cream cone to stare at me.</p><p>The line&#x2019;s gone dead, but rather than call back, I finish filling up and drive back across the street to pick up my wife, my daughter, and my Frappuccino.</p><p>As we pull back into traffic on the I-5, a trickle of sangfroid starts back through my veins, enough, at least, to think about assassination in generic terms. My old promise to myself to take a look into its dos and don&#x2019;ts isn&#x2019;t going to let me be. By the way, it&#x2019;s the way things usually work with me, pestering me until I finally do something about it.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been around enough political murder to know that with The Hague&#x2019;s Hariri probe I&#x2019;ve been sucked down into a poisonous swamp. Operating off dark rules and a pitiless logic all its own, it&#x2019;s a place where the capable assassin does win with one swift, precise, and violent act.</p><p>One scalp&#x2019;s enough to end any discussion. I could take a couple pages to list the political blank spots on the map where the rules still hold. But I wonder if it&#x2019;s not more instructive to take a run at answering my old question of why it is that most assassinations add up to nothing.</p><p>Normally, I&#x2019;d go home and dust off the standard references&#x2014;some Clausewitz of assassination, say. But there isn&#x2019;t one. Nor are the historians much help either. They&#x2019;re more than happy to serve up long laundry lists of political murder, but they are too timid to include even the most deeply buried footnote about a set of possible tactics for assassination. Is it because assassination is still taboo? Then again, I suppose it&#x2019;s only the fool who puts on paper that there might be a science to culling out the bad apples.</p><p>What I know for certain is that I&#x2019;ll have to hack assassination down to manageable proportions. Ignoring the legality or formal justification for the act is the easiest decision. Did Hariri&#x2019;s assassin care? Does any assassin care? Anyhow, that&#x2019;s someone else&#x2019;s book. The same holds for what Hunter S. Thompson called &#x201c;celebrity assassinations&#x201d;&#x2014;a psychotic lone wolf with a gun. &#x201c;Squeaky&#x201d; Fromme&#x2019;s taking a potshot at Gerald Ford tells us nothing about political murder. Finally, assassinations tied up in armed mutinies, palace intrigue, dynastic struggles, and racial hatred aren&#x2019;t of much interest either. They&#x2019;re more about prejudice, greed, and personal ambition than genuine politics.</p><p>What intrigues me more are political murders that truly alter history, for better or worse. For instance, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin&#x2019;s. Two bullets put an end to the best chance of a Middle East peace we&#x2019;ll have for who knows how long. But what makes his any different from the rivers of blood that have drowned the Middle East all these centuries?</p><p>Long ago, the ancients decided that the most efficient way to put an end to an intolerable tyranny is tyrannicide. It beats war and civil war hands down. No one since has seriously argued against it. Which makes me wonder why I can&#x2019;t borrow the same measuring stick for modern</p><p>political murder. If a murder reduces violence or moves history in the right direction, it&#x2019;s an acceptable social bargain. If it doesn&#x2019;t, it isn&#x2019;t. Going by this standard, very few assassinations would make the cut. But of those that do, surely there have to be lessons attached.</p><p>Since assassination, even pared down, is a big, unwieldy subject, I&#x2019;ve decided to take as a guide someone who followed the rules and made it work. Namely, Hariri&#x2019;s assassin. In one flick of a switch he decapitated his main enemy (Lebanon&#x2019;s Sunni Muslims), leaving them fragmented</p><p>and rudderless. With Hariri out of the picture, he and his side (Hezbollah) inexorably tightened its grip on Lebanon, and in the bargain brought a sort of peace to that troubled nation. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the Arab Spring, Hezbollah&#x2019;s authority until this day would be effectively uncontested. (I&#x2019;ll get serious pushback on this, but let me develop the argument as I go.)</p><p>And Hariri wasn&#x2019;t a one-off either. I was pretty much there at his assassin&#x2019;s coming-out&#x2014;Lebanon in the early eighties. I watched as he rose from its smoldering civil war like Venus from the half shell, fluently conversant in the fine and shifting relationship between violence and</p><p>power. He instinctively understood how symbolic murder and blind slaughter get the assassin nothing. How with each bloodletting, the assassin needs to measurably augment his power. How assassination is a conservative force designed to preserve force and postpone war. How, at bottom, it&#x2019;s a detour around war and civil war.</p><p>Like the young Buddha, Hariri&#x2019;s assassin learned the plumbing at an early age&#x2014;his bombs always went off, he never killed the wrong person, he didn&#x2019;t get caught (or, at least, until Hariri). When you put him down on the examining table with other modern assassins, with all of the dumb blood they&#x2019;ve splattered the world with, he was the Leonardo da Vinci of political murder. Even his most implacable enemies conceded him that honor. Or as Hariri&#x2019;s assassin would tell us if he were still alive, either get the basics right or don&#x2019;t touch it.</p><p>I understand that borrowing the eyes of a dead, cold-blooded murderer to examine anything isn&#x2019;t everyone&#x2019;s idea of stretching out on a hammock for a pleasant summer&#x2019;s read. (Nor will it be a particular recommendation that the author once plotted his protagonist&#x2019;s murder.) But it&#x2019;s drone strikes, not me, that have turned political murder into a fixed instrument of statecraft. In the primal ooze, as anyone who&#x2019;s been there will tell you, one takes one&#x2019;s lessons where one finds them. And there was never anyone better at it than the man we knew best as Hajj Radwan, roughly the &#x201c;Delightful One,&#x201d; a nickname not without a little irony.</p><p>I spent my best years on the bastard&#x2019;s trail, and although I never laid eyes on him, we were the most intimate of enemies. His rules, as I understand them, follow. So does his life, because he lived the rules. So does mine, because for so long I lived in a world of his invention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Broken Wings</h2><p>Kahlil Gibran deeply stirred readers the world over with "The Prophet", a modern classic of surpassing beauty and moral grandeur. In "The Broken Wings", the Lebanese poet-philosopher reveals the same artistry and wisdom that have enshrined his name in the hearts of millions as an "Immortal Prophet" and a "Dante of the Twentieth Century". <p>This is the exquisitely tender story of a love that beats desperately against the taboos of Oriental tradition. With great sensitivity and lyricism, Gibran describes his passion as a youth for Selma Karamy, the beautiful girl of Beirut who first unfolded to him the secrets of love. But it is a love that is doomed by a social convention which forces Selma into marriage with another man. </p><p>Portraying the exalted happiness and infinite sorrow of his relationship with Selma, Gibran at the same time probes the spiritual meaning of human existence with profound compassion.

This appealing anthology, illustrated with his own sketches and photographs, brings together Jackson`s most famous essays, significant but less well known writings, and articles that were originally published unsigned or under various pseudonyms.</p><p><b>Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz</b> is professor of history and American studies at Smith College.A large and varied sampler of essays by the late doyen of American cultural geography, who died in 1996. To judge by this well-edited assemblage, spanning half a century, Jackson (``Brink'' to friends and students) never saw a landscape he didn't like. He writes with the high excitement of discovery and boosterism. An intellectual who, trained in the classical arts of Europe, came late to appreciate the vernacular style of, say, a Vermont farmhouse or a New Mexico adobe, Jackson championed the cause of the native in all its manifestations. Thus we have his notes on ``helix sports,'' a lovely term for surfing, snowboarding, sailing, and the other ``sports of mobility''; his careful study of the transformation of the American backyard and garage from places of work to places of private recreation (and, now that garages are being remade into home offices, to places of work once again); his thoughtful remarks on the best uses of shared spaces, of ``learning to use them in a temporary way in order to overcome both the old-fashioned biological exclusiveness and the more modern emphasis on competition and control.'' Jackson exhibits any number of well-considered prejudices, among them a liking for not-too-orderly urban centers; at one point, he proposes that the Ford Foundation give grants to students of city planning with the condition that ``for a year they would look at no picture books of Brave New Sweden and spend the time instead in the heart of some chaotic, unredeemed, ancient city.'' Editor Horowitz, a historian at Smith College, recounts Jackson's career as a freelance scholar, reminding us that, as a self-taught geographer, he was always held in some mistrust by the academy. Highly recommended for geographers and students of the American scene. (51 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is perhaps best known by mystery enthusiasts for his comic crime novels (<i>Smoke</i>, <i>Baby, Would I Lie?</i>, <i>Trust Me on This</i>) and his Dortmunder series (<i>What's the Worst That Could Happen?</i>, <i>Don't Ask</i>, <i>Drowned Hopes</i>). <i>The Hook</i>, however, moves beyond the machinations and deduction-driven plots of traditional mystery, following the path Westlake spearheaded with <i>The Ax</i> into the twisted labyrinth of psychological suspense. <i>The Hook</i> is a harrowing story, told with a crisp incisiveness, and its riveting central characters are extraordinary: Bryce Proctorr and Wayne Prentice are fascinating, compelling tangles of neuroses and ambitions, both wonderfully drawn.<p> Bryce Proctorr has a multi-million dollar contract for his next novel, a wife who is trying to extract the last pound of flesh (but money will do just as well) from him in an ugly divorce, a fast-approaching deadline, and a serious case of writer's block. Wayne Prentice is an author drifting ghost-like through a world that has forgotten his novels; he's gone through two pseudonyms, has watched his sales plummet, and is wondering whether the academic life might be better than this, all things considered. When the two meet by chance in the New York Library, Proctorr has a proposition: if Prentice will give him his unsold manuscript to publish under Proctorr's name, the two will split the book advance fifty-fifty. But as in all Faustian bargains, there is a significant catch: Wayne must kill Bruce's wife.</p><p> The murder itself is almost insignificant, a small and sordid endeavor. The novel's real appeal lies in its shadowy reflections of the links between the two protagonists: a bond has been created that neither can break--nor wants to. Westlake cleverly questions the boundaries between actual and vicarious experience, fact and fiction. The novel is strikingly self-referential as it plays with the irony of authors trying to "compose" their own realities: "There are moments in almost any novel when it's necessary to move a character from one point to another, so that you can go on with the story, and this was like that." But what happens when the characters, instead of dutifully obeying the wishes of their creators, strike off on their own in unanticipated and fearful directions? <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>DONALD E. WESTLAKE has written numerous novels over the past thirty-five years under his own name and pseudonyms, including Richard Stark. Many of his books have been made into movies, including The Hunter, which became the brilliant film noir Point Blank, and the 1999 smash hit Payback. He penned the Hollywood scripts for The Stepfather and The Grifters, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay. The winner of three Edgar awards and a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Donald E.

He went East to boarding school and to Yale, where he wrote the football anthems "Hail to Yale" and "Bull Dog," and show after show in which many of his classmates appeared--among them, Archibald MacLeish, Gerald Murphy, Dean Acheson, and Averell Harriman. Then a brief, unhappy stint at Harvard Law School. Off to Paris at twenty-six, and in crisis joining the French Foreign Legion during the First World War. Two years later, Cole Porter had his first Broadway hit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William McBrien's biography, the result of ten years of work and bursting with stories and scenes of Porter's life, takes us beyond the patina of Porter's very public career, beyond the high and low aristocratic worlds of Venice (Porter with Elsa Maxwell in 1923 together put Venice back on the map as the place to be), beyond the opulent parties and costume balls on two continents he not only attended but threw himself--and made into an art form. McBrien takes us into Porter's seemingly conventional marriage to reveal his complicated emotional life--the lost, privileged man who had a wild, irrepressible talent to amuse but at first find couldn't find his voice; the man who married "the most beautiful woman in the world," the very social, very southern Linda Lee Thomas, but who preferred his own sex. He had long relationships as well as frequent dalliances with many men but for thirty-five years maintained a loving marriage to the woman he truly adored.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the supremely gifted Porter who created twenty musicals on Broadway (Anything Goes, DuBarry Was a Lady, Gay Divorce, Born to Dance), writing for such stars as Ethel Merman, Fred Astaire, Mary Martin, Bert Lahr, and Bea Lilly; and who gave Hollywood Fifty Million Frenchmen, The Gay Divorcee, Rosalie, Broadway Melody of 1940, Night and Day, High Society, Silk Stockings, Can-Can, and Kiss Me, Kate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porter was "the top" and lived at the top, but his life was catastrophically transformed after a near-fatal horseback-riding accident. The thirty-one operations during the next eighteen years brought on increasing pain, and the growing paralysis that darkened his life was never hinted at publicly nor in his work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interweaving the life and the music, McBrien shows us a man whose genius as a composer flowered in deceptively simple melodies that were thought to be completely modern but today are considered ingenious, complicated, and steeped in the nineteenth-century tradition of lieder; a composer whose craft concealed complicated solutions to musical problems while it enchanted his audiences. And we come to understand how Porter's doubts and desires, longings and infatuations, insinuated their way into the heart of his incomparable words and music.</p><p>It's not quite as witty as a Porter song (who could equal the incomparable Cole?), but this thorough biography honors the Broadway musical's worldliest, most intelligent composer by taking him seriously. Voluminous research buttresses William McBrien's portrait of a charmed life scarred by tragedy. Born in 1891, Porter left his wealthy family in Indiana to thoroughly enjoy himself at Yale University in Connecticut, where his sassy songs gave the Midwestern outsider social clout. Although exclusively homosexual, Porter was nonetheless devoted to the wealthy widow he married in 1919, and McBrien's narrative of their 1920s travels through Europe captures the glamorous sheen of their life together. Porter had some early success with shows like <i>Fifty Million Frenchmen</i>, but his sustained run of hits began in 1932 with <i>Gay Divorce</i>, continuing through the '50s and <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>. The author liberally quotes from Porter's deliciously naughty lyrics, reminding us how corny most show tunes seem when compared to "Love for Sale" or "Anything Goes." McBrien's painful account of the ghastly aftermath of a 1937 riding accident, which left Porter in pain that ended only with his death in 1964, reveals a quiet, uncomplaining stoic whose substance matched his dazzling style. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"A complex and groundbreaking portrait...making use of previously unpublished material...Never-before-seen letters shine light into Porter's ongoing relationships"<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><p>"Read this book...You will spend time with, and get to know, one of the great creative figures of the twentieth century."<br>--Betty Comden, <i>The New York Observer</i></p><p>"Loaded with juicy gossip...He succeeds in evoking Porter's white-tie-and-orchids set.

Original. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>Richard Laymon is the prolific author of more than 30 novels and 65 short stories which have been published in Ellery Queen, Alfred Hitchcock and Cavalier. A Bram Stoker and Science Fiction Chronicle Award-winning author, his novels have been translated into fifteen languages.In February of this year, Laymon, then president of the Horror Writers Association, died of a heart attack at age 53. A few weeks ago, the last of his novels to be published before his death, The Traveling Vampire Show, won the HWA's Stoker Award for best novel of the year. Soon after Laymon died, Cemetery Dance, which issued that award winner, brought out Night in the Lonesome October. But it turns out that wasn't the last we'll see of Laymon, nor is this new, enjoyable short novel. The Beast House Chronicles, launched in 1979, made Laymon's reputation. This novella is the slightest of the series four entries, emotionally as well as in page length, but it features all the trademark Laymon touches. There's a horny teen protagonist, Mark, and a spooky adventure, as Mark accepts the dare of the girl of his wet dreams, Alison, that he help her sneak into Beast House, scene of several horrific murders during past decades and now a major tourist attraction in the small West Coast town where it stands. There are plenty of suspenseful and scary moments as Mark breaks into the Beast House and hides in the Beast Hole, and a particularly shocking twist at book's end. Above all, there's that inimitable Laymon style, the use of simple, strong sentences to construct, via extraordinarily vivid sensual detail, a narrative that envelops the reader in a moment by moment revelation of events in the service of a story that's terrific, nasty fun. All Laymon fans and anyone who likes horror served with a cackle are going to like this one. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Solutions, Minerals, and Equilibria</h2><p>&#34;this change makes the equilibrium pH slightly lower&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</h2><p>Haroun is the son of Rashid, the greatest of all storytellers who conjures up magical worlds and brings laughter to the city of Alifbay. Then one terrible day, everything goes wrong. Haroun&#39;s father runs out of stories to tell. Haroun is determined to return the storyteller&#39;s gift to his father.</p><p>Immediately forget any preconceptions you may have about Salman Rushdie and the controversy that has swirled around his million-dollar head. You should instead know that he is one of the best contemporary writers of fables and parables, from any culture. <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i> is a delightful tale about a storyteller who loses his skill and a struggle against mysterious forces attempting to block the seas of inspiration from which all stories are derived. Here's a representative passage about the sources and power of inspiration: <blockquote> So Iff the water genie told Haroun about the Ocean of the Stream of Stories, and even though he was full of a sense of hopelessness and failure the magic of the Ocean began to have an effect on Haroun. He looked into the water and saw that it was made up of a thousand thousand thousand and one different currents, each one a different colour, weaving in and out of one another like a liquid tapestry of breathtaking complexity; and Iff explained that these were the Streams of Story, that each coloured strand represented and contained a single tale. Different parts of the Ocean contained different sorts of stories, and as all the stories that had ever been told and many that were still in the process of being invented could be found here, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was in fact the biggest library in the universe. And because the stories were held here in fluid form, they retained the ability to change, to become new versions of themselves, to join up with other stories and so become yet other stories; so that unlike a library of books, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was much more than a storeroom of yarns. It was not dead, but alive. <p> "And if you are very, very careful, or very, very highly skilled, you can dip a cup into the Ocean," Iff told Haroun, "like so," and here he produced a little golden cup from another of his waistcoat pockets, "and you can fill it with water from a single, pure Stream of Story, like so," as he did precisely that. </p></blockquote><b>Salman Rushdie</b> is the author of eleven novels&#x2014;<i>Grimus</i>, <i>Midnight&#x2019;s Children</i> (for which he won the Booker Prize and the Best of the Booker), <i>Shame</i>, <i>The Satanic Verses</i>, <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i>, <i>The Moor&#x2019;s Last Sigh</i>, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i>, <i>Fury</i>, <i>Shalimar the Clown</i>, <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i>, and <i>Luka and the Fire of Life</i>&#x2014;and one collection of short stories: <i>East, West</i>.

S. Eliot's writing. He reveals the reasons for the remarkable commercial successes of William Shawn's <i>New Yorker</i> and William Paley's CBS. He uncovers the connection between Larry Flynt's <i>Hustler</i> and Jerry Falwell's evangelism, between the atom bomb and the Scholastic Aptitude Test. He locates the importance of Richard Wright, Norman Mailer, Pauline Kael, Christopher Lasch, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine. And he lends an ear to Al Gore in the White House as the Starr Report is finally presented to the public. <br><br>Like his critically acclaimed bestseller, <i>The Metaphysical Club, American Studies</i> is intellectual and cultural history at its best: game and detached, with a strong curiosity about the political underpinnings of ideas and about the reasons successful ideas insinuate themselves into the culture at large. From one of our leading thinkers and critics, known both for his "sly wit and reportorial high-jinks [and] clarity and rigor" (<i>The Nation</i>), these essays are incisive, surprising, and impossible to put down.<br></p><p><b>Louis Menand</b> is Distinguished Professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>.<br><b>American Studies</b><br><b>William James and the Case of the Epileptic Patient</b><b>1</b><b>I</b>n 1901, when he was fifty-nine, William James delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh. James was an international academic celebrity. <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>, which appeared in 1890 and which had taken him twelve years to write, had been quickly recognized as the leading summation of developments in a field transformed by the introduction of laboratory methods and by the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin. An abridged edition for students, <i>Psychology: Briefer Course,</i> popularly known as "Jimmy," appeared in 1892; by the time of the Gifford Lectures, it had sold nearly fifty thousand copies.The Gifford lectureship was a two-year appointment. James returned to Edinburgh for the second set of lectures in 1902, and that year the lectures were published as <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience.</i> The <i>Varieties</i> has probably been, over the years, James's most popular book, read even when his functionalist psychology had been superseded by Freudianism and behaviorism, and his pragmatist philosophy was in eclipse. It is composed primarily of casehistories, collected from all around the world and organized by category--"Conversion," "Saintliness," "Mysticism," and so on. It looks, in other words, like a psychology textbook, and that is because it is a psychology textbook. The <i>Varieties</i> is not a study of religion; it is, as the subtitle states, "a study in human nature."James regarded the investigation of religious experience as a branch of abnormal psychology. He did not think that by treating the subject in this manner he was debunking religion; he thought that by treating it in this manner he was taking religion seriously. His approach reflected the holistic empiricism of which he was possibly the greatest nineteenth-century exponent: people have religious experiences, just as people have the experience of seeing tables or feeling cold. We assume that having the experience of seeing tables has something to do with there being tables in the world, and that feeling cold has something to do with a change in the temperature. Not everyone has visions or receives mystical revelations; but some human beings do. Those experiences are as psychologically real as any other state of consciousness, and since consciousness has evolved for the purpose of helping us to cope with our environment--since consciousness is not epiphenomenal, but is an active player in life--there must be something in the universe to which the religious feeling "belongs." "God is real," as James put it, summing up what he took to be the common-sense intuition about religion, "since he produces real effects."1When he published the lectures, James put the sixth and seventh together in a chapter called "The Sick Soul." "The Sick Soul" is an examination of morbidity--pessimism, disillusionment, anhedonia, and various types of melancholy, one of which James calls "panic fear," and as an illustration of which he offers the following case:Here is an excellent example, for permission to print which I have to thank the sufferer. The original is in French, and though the subject was evidently in a bad nervous condition at the time of which he writes, his case has otherwise the merit of extreme simplicity. I translate freely."Whilst in this state of philosophic pessimism and general depression of spirits about my prospects, I went one evening into a dressing-room in the twilight to procure some article that was there; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear of my own existence. Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an epileptic patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black-haired youth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all day on one of the benches, or rather shelves against the wall, with his knees drawn up against his chin, and the coarse gray undershirt, which was his only garment, drawn over them enclosing his entire figure. He sat there like a sort of sculptured Egyptian mummy, moving nothing but his black eyes and looking absolutely nonhuman. This image and my fear entered into a species of combination with each other. <i>That shape am I</i>, I felt, potentially. Nothing that I possess can defend me against that fate, if the hour for it should strike for me as it struck for him. There was such a horror of him, and such a perception of my own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a mass of quivering fear. After this the universe was changed for me altogether. I awoke morning after morning with a horrible dread at the pit of my stomach, and with a sense of the insecurity of life that I never knew before, and that I have never felt since. It was like a revelation; and although the immediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me sympathetic with the morbid feelings of others ever since. It gradually faded, but for months I was unable to go out into the dark alone."In general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how other people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so unconscious of that pit of insecurity beneath the surface of life. My mother in particular, a very cheerful person, seemed to me a perfect paradox in her unconsciousness of danger, which you may well believe I was very careful not to disturb by revelations of my own state of mind. I have always thought that this experience of melancholia of mine had a religious bearing."On asking this correspondent to explain more fully what he meant by these last words, the answer he wrote was this:"I mean that the fear was so invasive and powerful that if I had not clung to scripture-texts like 'The eternal God is my refuge,' etc., 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,' etc., 'I am the resurrection and the life,' etc., I think I should have grown really insane."2As everyone now knows, the business about this being translated from the French was a pretense. In 1904, the <i>Varieties</i> was itself translated into French, and the translator, a man named Frank Abauzit, wrote to James requesting, understandably, the original text for this passage. "The document," James wrote back, " ... is my own case--acute neurasthenic attack with phobia. I naturally disguised the <i>provenance</i>! So you may translate freely."3 Abauzit was a friend of the Swiss psychologist Th�odore Flournoy, who was a friend of James's: they shared an interest in psychic phenomena--spiritualism, mediums, trances, and so on. James died in 1910; a year later, Flournoy published a little book called <i>La Philosophie de William James,</i> in which he quoted the passage in the <i>Varieties</i> about the vision of the epileptic and cited James's letter to Abauzit confessing the deception. And that is how it became known that the story is autobiographical.Edwin Holt, who had published <i>The Principles of Psychology,</i> and William James, Jr., James's son, put out an English edition of Flournoy's book in 1917, but they removed the material about the vision of the epileptic patient: neither the quotation from the <i>Varieties</i> nor the reference to James's letter appears in it. In 1920, though, the story was quoted and identified as James's own in <i>The Letters of William James,</i> edited by his oldest son, Henry, and it has turned up in virtually every account of James's life ever since. It has been the cause of endless biographical mischief; for although the vision of the epileptic has an important place in the story of James's thought, it does not have an important place in the story of James's life.This may seem counterintuitive. James called the story, in his letter to Abauzit, "my own case," after all, and there is no reason to believe that he made <i>that</i> up. It is the story of a kind of crisis, andbiographies tend conventionally to be structured as crisis-and-recovery narratives, in which the subject undergoes a period of disillusionment or adversity, and then has a "breakthrough" or arrives at a "turning point" (or, in the case of religious figures, undergoes a conversion experience) before going on to achieve distinction. The vision of the epileptic is an obvious candidate for such a crisis in James's life, and most biographers have elected it to the office. But that is the wrong place to put it.In the standard narrative of James's life, the vision of the epileptic is paired with a second experience, which is made to represent James's recovery or breakthrough. This is what can be called the Renouvier episode. Information about it also first surfaced in the 1920 edition of James's <i>Letters</i>. In this case the source is a diary James kept from 1868, when he was twenty-six and studying in Germany, until 1873, when he accepted an offer to join the Harvard faculty. The entry for April 30, 1870, reads as follows. (The reference in the second sentence is to the second of the <i>Essais de critique g�n�rale,</i> entitled <i>L'Homme</i> [1859], by the French philosopher Charles Renouvier; "Bain," later on, is Alexander Bain, a British psychologist who was a friend and follower of John Stuart Mill.)I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life. I finished the first part of Renouvier's second "Essais" and see no reason why his definition of Free Will--"the sustaining of a thought <i>because I choose to</i> when I might have other thoughts"--need be the definition of an illusion. At any rate, I will assume for the present--until next year--that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will. For the remainder of the year, I will abstain from the mere speculation and contemplative <i>Gr�blei</i> [in this context, "grubbing among subtleties"] in which my nature takes most delight, and voluntarily cultivate the feeling of moral free...</p><h2>The Complete book of Drawing- Essential skills for every artist.</h2><p>The Complete book of Drawing- Essential skills for every artist.</p><p></p><h2>Faith and Philosophy of Zorastrianism</h2><p>Zoroastrianism was founded by Zarathushtra Spitama.

Shortly after his arrival in the United States in 1973, he drew crowds to Los Angeles's Ma Maison, where he was chef and part owner. He now owns five spectacular restaurants in California, each one a fantastic creation designed by his wife and partner, Barbara Lazaroff. Spago, their first adventure in restaurateuring, has been a Los Angeles phenomenon since it opened in 1982. Their second restaurant, Chinois on Main, opened in 1983 and features inventive and interpretive Chinese-French cuisine. San Francisco boasts Postrio, whose menus are inspired by the local Italian and Asian communities. In 1990 the Puck-Lazaroff duo opened Eureka Brewery. and Restaurant, where Puck serves up his celebrated pizzas along with homemade breads and charcuterie. Their latest adventure, opened in August 1991, is Granita, which offers Puck's interpretation of the flavors and dishes of the Mediterranean.<br><br>In addition to Adventures in the Kitchen, Wolfgang Puck is the author of The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook, which Craig Claiborne calls "a modem classic," and Wolfgang Puck's Modern French Cooking.The indefatigable Puck has just opened his fifth restaurant; here is a delightful sampling of the dishes that have made his earlier ventures so popular.

There are some "fancy" dishes here, a few requiring advance preparations or expensive ingredients, but most are perfectly suited to home cooks; the attractive assortment of simple but imaginative sauces and condiments, for example, would add zest to many meals, and the majority of the desserts are more homey than anything else.

Philippe's obsession with the girl's safety morphs into something sinister and grotesque as she grows into a beautiful teen. A young man named Darius, visiting Philippe with a business proposition, encounters Angelica and intuits their secret -- he decides to rescue her, but the attempt goes awry and he flees England by sea.<br><br>This contemporary story mirrors the ancient legend of Antiochus, whose love for the daughter of his dead wife was discovered by the adventurer Appolinus of Tyre. The tale appeared in many forms through the ages; Apollinus becoming the swashbuckling Pericles in Shakespeare's eponymous play. In <i>The Porpoise</i>, as Angelique comes to terms with a life imprisoned on her father's estate, Darius morphs into Pericles, voyaging through a mythic world. In a bravura feat of storytelling, Haddon recounts his many exploits in thrilling fashion, mining the meaning of the old legends while creating parallels with the monstrous modern world Angelica inhabits.

She would not be allowed on a commercial flight but they have been staying with friends who own a vineyard in Bellevue Champillon and one of the other guests, Viktor, has a Piper PA-28 Warrior which he intends to fly back to Popham the following morning. His Land Rover is waiting at the airfield and it will be the simplest thing in the world to drop her at the Winchester house en route to the south coast. Her husband, Philippe, does not like placing Maja in the care of another man, let alone one he has met only two days previously, but the jigsaw falls so serendipitously into place that refusal is almost impossible. He will drive to Paris, leave the car at the apartment, take the Eurostar to London and be back in Winchester a day later.<br><br> Besides, Maja enjoys small planes. Travel has become too easy. You fall asleep in Istanbul and wake up in Beijing. She likes to watch the miles tick by&#x2014;river deltas, irrigation circles, clouds spooling into exis�tence downwind of peaks. She retains a vivid memory of flying over Oslofjord as a girl, island after island, summerhouses, quays, boats, the sun&#x2019;s reflection skimming the water, some revelation which lay just beyond words about the relation between scale and escape and the surface of the earth. In addition, the morning sickness which persisted unnaturally late into her pregnancy has finally faded; she is experi�encing the fabled glow and eager to indulge the freedom that comes with it before she devotes her life to a very small and very demanding human being.<br><br> Philippe&#x2019;s anxiety is justified. Viktor has a Private Pilot&#x2019;s Licence but no Instrument Rating. This wouldn&#x2019;t matter were he travelling with only his nine-year-old son, Rudy. They would head off early and if the weather or other circumstances were to change he could either postpone the flight till the following day or divert to one of his alter�nates if they were already airborne. But Maja wakes late and takes a long breakfast and packs slowly and has mislaid a coral necklace which, she insists, can be couriered to the UK if and when it is found, but which becomes the object of a painstaking and fruitless search of what is a very large house. Lunch has come and gone by the time she is ready to leave. Were Maja less attractive Viktor would feel no com�punction about inconveniencing her but, having been underwhelmed by her performances on screen, he is surprised to find himself in the company of a woman who makes him fifteen again&#x2014;thick blonde hair, blue, blue eyes, cartoon-pretty, engagingly shambolic, just this side of plump. There is a scar on her cheek, courtesy of a rook which flew in through her bedroom window when she was ten years old. Viktor&#x2019;s infatuation is enjoyable but mildly alarming for a man who is used to having a courtroom, indeed any room, in the palm of his hand.<br><br> The necklace will be found six months later by the gardener, Bruno, tarnished and grubby in a stand of poplars at the very edge of the property where the Beaufours rarely venture, let alone their guests. The only explanation they will be able to find is that some animal, drawn to the bright colour, has dragged it from the poolside, across the grass and into the trees before realising the pointlessness of the effort. They consider sending it to Winchester but cannot find the appropri�ate words for the accompanying letter, so it is laid quietly at the back of a drawer where it remains for many years.<br><br> Viktor rings the airfield to check the weather one final time before they leave the house. The report is not reassuring but he accepts it as a given that they are going to fly. Far from irritating him, he finds to his surprise that the delay has made Maja more endearing. He will not allow himself to appear anxious or ill-prepared in her eyes, so he dons those metaphorical robes which bestow a radiant confidence in the rightness of his own pronouncements, and the clear sky suggests that the weather is as susceptible as any jury to the force of his personality.<br><br> They walk out onto the tarmac and Rudy climbs into the plane straight away. Maja watches while Viktor performs the external checks, her visible enjoyment of the process reigniting some of the excitement he once felt himself before every flight. He climbs into the cabin through the single door, sits himself in the pilot&#x2019;s seat then helps her in. He leans across her lap to pull the door shut, shows her how the seat belt works and gives her a headset. They refuel then park up into the wind. He puts the brakes on, checks the fuel is drawing from the emptier tank, switches to the fuller and runs through the power checks. Magnetos, carburettor, trim, full and free movement, hatch and harness. They taxi to the runway and wait for a Hawker 600 to take off, bank right and dissolve into the blue.<br><br> They have not left the ground but Rudy is already asleep in the back seat, lullabied by the rumble and bounce. He is ill at ease in the company of most other children but he is utterly self-sufficient, so this holiday has been, for him, a little heaven during which he has had unrestricted access to a pool, a well-stocked refrigerator with dou�ble doors and a set of thirty-two Caran d&#x2019;Ache coloured pencils with which to continue writing and drawing his cartoon epic <i>The Knights of Kandor. </i>His fondest memory is that of swimming in the rain, having the vacated pool area entirely to himself, the pebbled fizz of the surface and the blue silence under. He goes to a boarding school where he is bullied by the other boys in a way that is too unspecific and too nebu�lous to complain about but which eats away at him, and there are only three more days of holiday left, so he has made the most of his limited time in Bellevue, going to bed late and rising early. Consequently he is exhausted. But he will not be returning to school. In two hours he will be dead.<br><br> &#x201c;Prunay tower. Golf Alpha Sierra at the hold and ready for departure.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Golf Alpha Sierra. Clear to take-off, runway zero one. Wind zero two zero degrees. Five knots.&#x201d;<br><br> Viktor has become lax recently but because Maja is sitting next to him he goes through the emergency protocols, reciting the mantra in his head as they accelerate along the runway. &#x201c;If I have an engine failure on the ground, I close the throttle and come to a halt. If I get an engine failure when I&#x2019;m just airborne but have sufficient room I close the throttle and land back on the runway. If I can&#x2019;t land on the runway I pick the safest area within thirty degrees left and right of the centre line and land in it.&#x201d;<br><br> Thirty miles per hour, forty, fifty . . . They take off and Viktor turns on track as they climb. He&#x2019;ll head north-west to Le Touquet then north along the coast to Cap Gris-Nez before crossing the Chan�nel to the Dover beacon. They level out at six thousand feet and Maja starts talking about riding a horse called Bombardier on the South Downs&#x2014;the Clarendon Way, Ashley Down, Beacon Hill . . . It&#x2019;s superficial chatter but she seems satisfied with a few well-placed noises of agreement and he likes the sound of her voice. Finally she stops fighting the roar of the engine and gives herself over to looking down at the landscape so that he is free to turn every now and then and imagine what she looks like naked.<br><br> Five thousand feet below it&#x2019;s a jumbled parquet of fields, half ploughed, half green, patches of forest over Saint-Gobain and Noyon, the fat snake of the Somme looping down towards Amiens. The sky is cloudier now, the blue fading, the air a little bumpier. He radios Lille Information for a heads-up. A few clouds at a thousand feet, broken cloud at fifteen hundred, overcast at five. Not perfect but they&#x2019;re head�ing towards Le Touquet anyway so there are no significant decisions to be made and Maja is talking again, about her husband&#x2019;s shortcom�ings this time, in a way which is sad and funny and surprisingly kind, so that Viktor feels drawn into a circle of confidence from which he has been excluded all week, a sensation so intensely pleasurable when combined with their physical closeness that he pays too little attention to the slowly deteriorating weather. Over Abbeville the cloud thickens unexpectedly. He loses visual contact with the ground and finds that his forward visibility has been reduced to the point where he can no longer distinguish the horizon. He knows precisely what he should do at this point&#x2014;carefully execute a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn and get out of what is a potentially disastrous situation as swiftly as he can. If Maja were noticeably concerned then this is precisely what he would do, but far from understanding the danger they are now in, she seems entranced.<br><br> &#x201c;You can imagine it&#x2019;s Turkey down there. Or Finland. Very Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry.&#x201d;<br><br> It is the most foolish thing he has ever done. Their safety&#x2014;her safety, Rudy&#x2019;s safety&#x2014;is more important than any other consideration, but there is some caveman part of his brain which is profoundly averse to being seen as less than competent, by anyone, let alone by a woman, and least of all by a woman he finds this attractive. The very act of turning over these thoughts in his mind has postponed the evasive action he should have taken by five, then ten, then fifteen seconds and convinced him that since he&#x2019;s on track he will hold his course and, fingers crossed, soon emerge from the other side of the cloud.<br><br> There is an American study everyone quotes during PPL training which says that the average life expectancy of a pilot who flies into cloud with no instrument training is ninety seconds. It had always seemed to him like a tactical exaggeration. <i>Keep out. Here be monsters</i>. Or a measure perhaps of the number of idiot farmers in rural Kansas who used crop-dusters like quad bikes. It is the speed with which he must read and react to the instruments which shocks him, and the dif�ficulty of ignoring the messages coming from his inner ear.<br><br> Maja gazes out of the window, unperturbed.<br><br> It is less than three minutes since they entered the cloud. He is shockingly tired and starting to feel dizzy, his brain so desperate for some fixed point to contradict all these deceptive signals of lift and twist and fall and yaw that he is starting to hallucinate dark shapes ahead. The aircraft pitches and banks. He over-corrects. He needs to lose height. Maybe he can get out from under the cloud cover. A glimpse of the ground is all he needs. He loosens the throttle a little and gently pushes the yoke forwards. Two thousand feet, a thousand feet, eight hundred.<br><br> Were he not concentrating so hard on keeping the plane level and straight he might realise the elementary mistake he is making. The altimeter is set to sea level. He is not over the sea. He is over the land. Four minutes. Five. The cloud is not clearing. There is a very real pos�sibility that they are going to crash. He is unconcerned about his own death, but he cannot bear the thought that he will kill his own son, he cannot bear the thought that he will kill a beautiful woman and her unborn child.<br><br> In his dream Rudy is playing with his imaginary friend, Babu. They are back at Bellevue. It is night-time and they have taken tri�angles of La Vache Qui Rit from the fridge and made themselves big tumblers of grenadine and turned on the pool lights so that the water is a turquoise slab of liquid light swaying in the dark.<br><br> Maja looks across and sees tears rolling down Viktor&#x2019;s face. He says, in an oddly formal voice, &#x201c;I really am so very, very sorry about this.&#x201d; She is sick with fear for perhaps ten seconds then the fog in front of the plane darkens for the merest moment before they strike the side of a grain silo. They are travelling at seventy miles per hour. The silo is empty so they rip through the corrugated iron. The Perspex wind�screen splits and pops out of its frame, the snapped edge taking Vik�tor&#x2019;s head clean off. They hit the far wall of the silo, rip through that in turn then plough, nose first, into the hard earth. The wheels collapse, the plane pitches forward and the engine block is punched backwards, crushing Maja&#x2019;s legs.<br><br> By chance a German doctor, Raphael Bhatt, is driving slowly along a small country road between Gapennes and Yvrench when he sees a green starboard wing light descending to the left of the car. The fog is so thick that he has no idea whether the plane is a Cessna or an Airbus. He hits the brakes for fear that the plane is going to veer across the road, but the light shoots ahead, lower than tree height now, and vanishes. He does not know the area well but he is fairly sure that there are no airfields nearby. He thinks he hears an explosion of some kind but it is possible that he has imagined it. He slows to a crawl and waits for the glow of flames, but there is only the road dissolving into the whiteness ahead. He wonders whether he really saw it, the way one does after extraordinary events which leave no mark on one&#x2019;s surroundings.<br><br>He picks up speed. After a few hundred metres he takes a lefthand turning onto a dirt track which leads to a dilapidated farm-house. A rusted tractor. A stack of old tyres. He suspects that he has come to the wrong place, that the plane landed somewhere else or gained altitude and is now five miles away. Nevertheless he gets out of the car. The only thing he can hear is the fog- muffled grunting of many pigs, the smell of whose shit is almost overpowering. The door of the farmhouse opens, a triangle of light cuts across the muddy yard and a portly woman trots towards him&#x2014; bun, floral apron, slippers&#x2014; shouting, <i>&#x201c;Venez! Venez!&#x201d; </i>as if she were relieved to find that he has finally arrived. She beckons him round the side of the farmhouse whose entire gable wall consists of black plastic sheeting held in place by a grid of wooden battens. An intruder floodlight comes on as they jog beneath it. The woman&#x2019;s husband stands facing them, immobile, pointing a beam of torchlight to his left like a bored usherette at the cinema. They turn the corner of a barn.</p><h2>The Duchess of Devonshire&#39;s Ball</h2><p>Depicts the fancy dress ball hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria</p><p></p><h2>The Genesis Wave Book Three (Star Trek: the Next Generation)</h2><p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the U.S.S.

Original.</p><p>John Vornholt is the author of several Star Trek novels including two of the bestselling four-volume Next Generation/Deep Space Nine DOMINION WAR sequence.<p>Chapter One<br> </p><p> She was the only one left of her species, and now they were trying to kill her. They wanted what she carried, and she knew she could save herself if she left it behind. Like her, it was the only one of its kind left. </p><p> The disruptor beam streaked past her crouching body, charring the corrugated tin wall and burning a hole in the vacant building. For an instant, the dusty alley was illuminated by blazing beams and molten metal. She clutched the bulky chrome box to her torso, knowing she could not disguise it from them. Her pursuers knew her true identity, and they were wearing environmental suits to protect themselves from her spores. No doubt, they were only firing to keep her pinned down. She counted three of them, and she assumed them to be Romulans, judging by their weapons and their knowledge. </p><p> A red fog drifted across the two slivered moons of Torga IV, giving the dingy alley a patina of exotic mystery. They could have rushed her, but they feared her. Feared what she could do with the box. </p><p> It was so strange being known, being exposed, when she had </p><p> operated for years undercover. She and the other Seedlings had infiltrated every nook of the Federation, but it was never to cause disruption. It was always to gather information -- to find out how the meat creatures could help them escape their dying world. Their roots had found nourishment in the garden of Starfleet. With the Genesis technology, they had discovered a way to prepare new homes and propagate their species at the same time. </p><p> All of that had ended three days ago, when their world was invaded and their base destroyed. After living among the meat creatures -- impersonating them -- the Seedling could appreciate the irony. The repository of all data on Genesis had once been a lone human being, and now it was the awkward silver box in her appendages. </p><p> If the Romulans had tracked her down, it meant they had ransacked the home base, deciphering the records. There was no other way for them to know about her -- that she had been entrusted with a portable device for a new experiment. No matter what, she had to resist giving the emitter to the Romulans, who were ruthless and unscrupulous. She either had to destroy it or give it to someone who would do no harm. Genesis could no longer benefit her species, but perhaps it could benefit someone. </p><p> The Seedling gazed up into the sky of Torga IV, where the blood-red night clouds had parted to reveal a sliver of stars. Somewhere up there were worlds full of her kind, but she was sworn never to go to them. They were new worlds, unsullied by past corruptions. If the meat creatures would allow, her species could have a fresh start -- without the temptation of humanoid hosts. </p><p> However, a rebirth was not to be for the Seedling, who knew too much and would corrupt them with her knowledge. She was doomed to perish no matter what else should happen. </p><p> A figure in a black environmental suit darted from an abandoned hovercraft to a dumpster, coming a few meters closer to her position in the alley. They were careful with their disruptor fire, because they didn't want to hit the box; but they wouldn't hesitate to kill her if they had a clear shot. That's why they were getting into position. </p><p> If she could draw their fire, decided the fugitive, she had to make them hit her precious box. If she couldn't save it from them, she had to destroy it. The alley was open behind her, but it was a long run to the walkway. The Seedling did not move swiftly, especially carrying the bulky device, which was nearly a meter tall and half a meter wide on each side. </p><p> At that moment, her salvation arrived in the form of a loud and rowdy crew of Bajoran miners and their consorts. They came weaving down the dusty walkway, toasting, drinking, and singing. The Seedling instantly called out in her most helpless voice. When they didn't stop, she screamed again and again until the unruly party halted on the sidewalk and peered into the dark alley. </p><p> There was a chance the miners were all about to be slaughtered, but the Romulans were like her species, she reasoned. They preferred stealth and guile to brute force and messy scenes. </p><p> The Bajorans came stumbling down the alley, and it took them a while to locate her and focus their eyes upon the pleasing Bajoran shape she had become -- at least to those within range of her spores. This subterfuge was second nature to the Seedling by now, and she instantly roused their concern and helpfulness. </p><p> "What's wrong with you?" asked one brawny male. His nose ridges rippled, and she sensed that he was attracted to her. </p><p> "Are you injured?" said another, kneeling beside her. <i>I remind him of an instructor he had in the orphanage. Such a broken, pathetic life he has endured.</i> </p><p> The miner took her arm and gingerly helped her sit up. The Seedling feigned dizziness for a moment as she absorbed more of their thoughts. </p><p> "Where did she come from?" sniffed one of the females to her </p><p> female friend. Their antagonism was a side effect she could do nothing about, so she ignored them and concentrated on the males. </p><p> "They tried to rob me," she rasped. </p><p> "Who?" snapped several Bajorans at once. </p><p> She pointed behind her at the narrow alley, where dim light faded into mist, shadow, and abandoned machines. The brawny one instantly ran down the thoroughfare, stomping and making his presence known. Her pursuers had been lurking there, but they were certainly gone now. </p><p> "Don't see them!" he called. </p><p> "It's okay," said the gentle one. "Let us get you some brestanti ale -- that will fix you up." </p><p> "Thank you," she replied with a smile. "Don't let me forget my luggage." She touched the shiny metal box, and he gallantly picked it up. </p><p> As they strode from the alley, the Seedling glanced over her shoulder at the dark passage between the corrugated buildings. She hadn't brought herself more than a few minutes of respite, and her pursuers were probably already on the roofs, planning their next move. </p><p> "What's the matter?" asked the gentle one. "You afraid they're still out there?" </p><p> "Yes." With a pleasant smile, she enhanced her similarity to the teacher he had loved at the age of ten. </p><p> "My name is Wislow. And yours?" </p><p> "Arden," she answered, choosing the identity she had used the most here. </p><p> "Pretty name," said the Bajoran male with a simpering smile. </p><p> When they reached the sidewalk, Arden gripped his arm and another male's, trying to keep herself surrounded by their flesh. She looked around and saw cheap industrial buildings lit by garish neon and halogen -- an instant city built on a dead planet. At least Torga IV had been dead until the discovery of cormaline deposits and the importation of thousands of impoverished Bajoran workers. </p><p> A string of small two-seater hovercraft swerved down the street, and pedestrians had to scatter. The majority of residents were Bajoran, but other races loitered on the dusty sidewalks. Down one alley, a contingent of Klingon miners were fighting <i>targs,</i> in contradiction to the law. From a low-slung balcony, females were soliciting males to enter a casino. Torga IV was a brutal, corrupt place, inhabited by the dregs of the quadrant. It had been a perfect place for Arden's canceled experiment, and now it would be a fitting place for her death. </p><p> "We're here!" said the gruff miner, grabbing her by the shoulders and trying to push her into a dimly lit tavern. She willed him to remember a lecture his grandmother had given him about the treatment of females, and he instantly released her. </p><p> "No. Please, not here." She appealed to Wislow. "What I want is someplace spiritual -- like a temple or a chapel." </p><p> "We've got them," answered the miner, "but you don't want to go there. They've been slammed with refugees from the Genesis Wave. Every morning they come to the commissary, looking for food we're throwing out." </p><p> "Even the bars are crowded," said one of the females with a wave of her hand, "and it's the middle of the night." </p><p> "We've got to celebrate surviving the wave!" said the brawny one, trying to hustle them through the door. </p><p> Arden remained steadfast as she concentrated on the sensitive Bajoran. "Wislow, I could use some help getting to the nearest temple." </p><p> "All of you go inside," he ordered confidently. "I'll escort the lady to the...which one?" </p><p> "The Shrine of the Prophets on Aurora Avenue is the closest," answered one of the females. "I've got friends working there, and I better hear from them that you showed up!" </p><p> The others laughed. <i>An odd reaction,</i> thought the Seedling, considering that billions of their fellow meat creatures had perished in the last few days, and billions more were homeless. But Torga IV had been spared, and the sleepy backwater had turned into a bustling city hosting an impromptu festival. Such were the recuperative powers of the meat creatures, who were to be envied. If she could find the right one to trust, she would give up her secret. But not to the Romulans, whom she had grown to detest. </p><p> Arden thought she saw someone in a black hood and suit moving among the convivial crowd. She tugged on Wislow's shoulder and said persuasively, "Let's go now."<br> </p><p> The bawling and mewling of the children never stopped, and most of them weren't even Bajorans. Prylar Yorka recoiled from the noise and the stench and sunk back into the vestibule atop the staircase. His elegant, richly appointed temple had been turned into a glaring warehouse for humanoid suffering. They were hungry, disoriented, grief-stricken, and sick...some very sick. He had called in the auxiliary volunteers, and Starfleet had contributed food and medical supplies; but they were still overwhelmed. </p><p> Plus the wretched smell had returned. They were taxing the sewage system, which was never designed to support this many residents; nor was it built to last this long. Who knew that the haphazard mining colony would last a decade and have its population doubled in a matter of hours? </p><p> Yorka stroked the wispy gray hair atop his head and considered bolting back to his private chambers, but he couldn't hide. This was what he was trained to do -- step in where needed and help the poor and afflicted. He pulled his maroon robes around his stout figure and tried to look officious and unruffled, when he felt out of his depth. He was nothing more than a prylar, a monk, but this sect respected him as a former vedek in the assembly. Yorka was their leader in all but name and rank. </p><p> He disdained titles now, feeling that ambition had caused the ills of mainstream Bajoran religion; and the Vedek Assembly disdained him, not recognizing his sect. For food, they had to depend upon local resources, but all of the replicators in town were churning out ale and appetizers for revelers and well-funded refugees. When he really needed help from the powers above him, none was forthcoming. </p><p> The aging Bajoran tried to put the worries out of his mind; he had to lead his acolytes and volunteers through this tragedy. The old lion had to muster the confidence needed to inspire them, even though he felt nothing but dread. Starfleet will return to relieve us, he told himself, just as they promised. Even so, they were disturbingly vague on when that might be. </p><p> <i>I could pray to the Prophets, but they -- and the leaders of my faith -- have abandoned me here. I have tried to shine the light of the Orbs, but no one has shown me any grace.</i> </p><p> "Prylar!" he heard someone yell. </p><p> Yorka broke out of his troubled reverie and glanced down the metal staircase, where Acolyte Bowmyk came charging toward him, his yellow robes dirty and blood-splattered. "Sir, you've got to come," said the young Bajoran, twisting his thin hands nervously. "We've had another one of those mysterious deaths -- we can't figure out why." </p><p> "Call the coroner," said Yorka, stomping down the stairs and brushing past him. </p><p> "We have, but they can't be here until dawn. That won't be for hours." The acolyte chased after his master, a worried look on his pinched face. </p><p> "What does the doctor think?" grumbled Yorka. </p><p> "The doctor has left for the day." </p><p> "What?" The burly monk stopped in his tracks, surrounded by refugees, overflowing the pews, sitting in the threshold of the sanctuary. His young assistant stared at him, and he knew he had to be forceful yet calm. This madness could not go on for long. </p><p> "What did the doctor say before he left?" asked Yorka evenly. </p><p> "He couldn't figure out what had killed him, but he said it wasn't anything contagious. There were some unusual tricorder readings, but no clear cause of death." </p><p> Yorka nodded sagely and managed a smile. "You see, there's no reason for concern, if it's not contagious. Take the bodies to the storage room." </p><p> "Where the food is?" asked Bowmyk, aghast. </p><p> "There's precious little of that," muttered Yorka. He pointed to a blood spot on the acolyte's satin tunic. "And change your clothes. Put on something more practical, if you're going to assist the sick." </p><p> "Yes, Master." The acolyte bowed and hurried off. </p><p> Yorka was immediately besieged by Ferengi, and he gritted his teeth. No one was more difficult to mollify than a suddenly impoverished Ferengi. A middle-aged businessman with three wives, who were wearing blankets at Yorka's insistence, shook his fist with such anger that his ear lobes wiggled. </p><p> "You've got to get us back to Ferenginar!" he demanded. "You don't know who I am -- you don't understand! I've got to file reports -- insurance forms -- " </p><p> The words were just a babble in Yorka's ears, because he already knew his reply. "I have no transportation to furnish, and you're free to leave or to stay in our house of worship. If you want to remain in our care, you must behave yourselves and abide by our rules. We'll do our best to feed and shelter you." </p><p> "That's not what they promised us! That's not what they promised us on the ship!" insisted the Ferengi. </p><p> "This isn't the ship," answered Yorka calmly. "Normally we're not a refugee station -- we're a temple offering outreach to the Bajoran community here. May I suggest that you pray to the Prophets? We're having services in half an hour." </p><p> "This is outrageous!" sputtered the Ferengi, stomping on the floor and wiping away real tears with his knuckles. "I lost my whole fortune -- my factories, my latinum...I lost everything." </p><p> Yorka raised an eyebrow. "You still have your life. And your wives." Behind him, three females looked at one another as if that wasn't a certainty. </p><p> "All I need is a few strips of latinum to help us get home," begged the Ferengi. "Perhaps you -- " </p><p> "Look around you, Sir," snapped Yorka. "Do we look like we are hoarding extra latinum? I recall two Rules of Acquisition, which I believe a Ferengi in your situation ought to consider deeply." </p><p> The distraught merchant blinked at him with surprise, and even his wives drew closer to hear the words of the Bajoran religious figure. </p><p> "Rule number two-hundred-thirty-six: You can't buy fate," began Yorka. "And rule number twenty-two: A wise m...</p></p><h2>Stack the Deck Revisited: Updated Patterns from Stack the Deck!</h2><p><p>Thousands of quilters around the world have discovered Karla Alexander's Stack the Deck technique, and the overwhelming response is--they love it!

It is a common misconception for spirituality to be viewed as movement toward the light instead of delving into, identifying, and integrating repressed aspects of our psyche. The consequences of this omission are visible every day in our addictive culture, its spiritual practices, and the high price that we all pay by depriving ourselves of this untapped reservoir of energy.</p><p><p><strong>Abdi Assadi</strong> is an author, healer, and spiritual counselor.</p>Shadows on the Path is not a self-help book. Nor is it one man's spiritual diatribe. It is a glimpse into the depths of what it means to face one's wounding and to hold the weight of it until it becomes weightless. It is a guide through the process of healing. This is a book that spoke to me on every level and has been a constant ever since. --<b>Sheryl Crow</b>, singer-songwriter<br><br>Shadows on the Path is word-bomb planted beneath the altar in the church of spiritual complacency, a grenade tossed into the fortified bunker of the ego, and a surgical laser to burn the clouds from the eyes of the unseeing. It is a dangerous book, only to be read with caution and by those ready and willing to wake up from the long sleep. --<b>Sting</b>, singer-songwriter</p><h2>Labyrinths</h2><p>Gathers stories about other worlds, paradoxes, and philosophical puzzles, and essays about literature</p><p>If Jorge Luis Borges had been a computer scientist, he probably would have invented hypertext and the World Wide Web. <p> Instead, being a librarian and one of the world's most widely read people, he became the leading practitioner of a densely layered imaginistic writing style that has been imitated throughout this century, but has no peer (although Umberto Eco sometimes comes close, especially in <i>Name of the Rose</i>). </p><p> Borges's stories are redolent with an intelligence, wealth of invention, and a tight, almost mathematically formal style that challenge with mysteries and paradoxes revealed only slowly after several readings. Highly recommended to anyone who wants their imagination and intellect to be aswarm with philosophical plots, compelling conundrums, and a wealth of real and imagined literary references derived from an infinitely imaginary library.</p>Jorge Luis Borges (1890-1982), Argentine poet, critic, and short-story writer, revolutionized modern literature.

A Cultural History of the Harlem Renaissance</h2><p>Lavishly illustrated with sepia-tone photographs, reproductions of historical documents, and full-color paintings, &#34;Harlem Stomp!&#34; is both a historical exploration and a lively celebration of the Harlem Renaissance.</p><p>Laban Carrick Hill has taught Literature and Writing at Columbia university, Fordham University, and currently teaches at St. Michael's College in Vermont. He has published his poetry and articles in a number of periodicals including American Letters &amp; Commentary, Denver Quarterly, and Onion River Review, and has written twenty middle grade novels for Hyperion and Bantam.<br><br>Acclaimed poet, essayist, and lecturer Nikki Giovanni has many published collections of her poetry, including Black Feeling, Black Talk and Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea: Poems and Not-Quite Poems. Her honors include the NAACP Image Award for Literature in 1998, and the Langston Hughes award for Distinguished Contributions to Arts and Letters in 1996.<br>Grade 7 Up-Hill explains the violence, frustration, and dreams of economic opportunity that led to the African-American migration to the North at the beginning of the 20th century. He describes the sense of pride, responsibility, and rights engendered by participation in World War I and the white resentment that resulted in such violence that James Weldon Johnson "dubbed the summer of 1919 the `Red Summer'" in response to the bloodshed. The author discusses why blacks settled in Harlem and how it became the "Mecca of the New Negro," attracting the likes of Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer, and Claude McKay. Also highlighted are publications such as the National Urban League's Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life, which not only supplied forums for these writers but also attempted to generate income for them and provide a sense of racial identity. Music, theater, and the visual arts are also covered. The book contains aspects of everyday culture, too, such as the role of churches, funeral processions, and rent parties. Numerous quotes from speeches, poems, articles, and other works are included. The volume is a visual feast, packed with contemporary photographs, reproductions, magazine covers, and posters, and enhanced by an interesting graphic design. Together, the words and images bring this extraordinary period to life. Pair it with James Haskins's The Harlem Renaissance (Millbrook, 1996), which remains the more in-depth textual overview.<br><i>Joanne K.

Each song, sound and picture that made the final cut has a story to tell.</p><p>The Golden Record is a 90-minute playlist of music from across the globe, a sound essay of life on Earth, spoken greetings in multiple languages, and more than 100 photographs, all painstakingly chosen by Sagan and his team to create an aliens' guide to Earthlings. The final playlist contains music written and performed by well-known names such as Bach, Beethoven, Chuck Berry and Blind Willie Johnson, as well as music from China, India and more remote cultures, such as a community in Small Malaita in the Solomon Islands. </p><p>Through interviews with all of the key players involved with the record, this book pieces together the whole story of the Golden Record. It addresses the myth that the Beatles were left off of the record because of copyright reasons and will include new information about US president Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s role in the record, as well as many other fascinating insights that have never been reported before. It also tells the love story between Carl Sagan and the project&#x2019;s creative director Ann Druyan that flourishes as the record is being created.</p><p>The Golden Record is more than just a time capsule.

Featuring static painted scenes and passages of text written in brief, declarative sentences, the flat spreads between each pop-up cover a range of topics from "Crafts and Trades" and "Homes in the City" to knightly training and daily life for both the upper and the lower classes. The former gets more play, however, as a knight named Sir Hugo functions as tour guide, injecting bland comments ("I enjoy the music and feasting at the king's banquet") while living the knightly life by participating in a tourney and various battles. The 3-D models are hard to open fully, and the castle in particular is fitted with big, clumsy connecting tabs. For quality of design and presentation, this doesn't match Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart's <i>Castle</i> (Scholastic, 2006), but the urban setting does add an unusual angle to a title that deserves consideration for displays and casual browsing.&#x2014;<i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rosenthal, whose life and world change drastically as AIDS has its impact on gays and nongays alike</p><p>In this witty first novel, Feinberg contrasts pre-AIDS 1980 with post-AIDS 1986, illuminating the changes that have come about in the gay community. In 1980, B.J. Rosenthal's biggest concern is finding a steady boyfriend, as he goes from one sex partner to another, but in 1986 his attention is focused on AIDS anxiety and the painful death of friends. Unlike the recent spate of somber novels dealing with AIDS, Feinberg's work mixes generous doses of humor with an increasing sense of pathos, bringing to mind the plays of Harvey Fierstein. To evoke the mood of each year, Feinberg injects a distracting string of pop culture references, but overall, this is an engrossing, honest novel. Highly recommended.James E.

In <i>Charles Fort: The Man Who Invented the Supernatural</i>, the acclaimed historian of stage magic Jim Steinmeyer goes deeply into the life of Charles Fort as he saw himself: first and foremost, a writer.<br><br>At the same time, Steinmeyer tells the story of an era in which the certainties of religion and science were being turned on their heads. And of how Fort&#x2014;significantly&#x2014;was the first man who challenged those orthodoxies not on the grounds of some counter-fundamentalism of his own but simply for the plainest of reasons: they didn&#x2019;t work. In so doing, Fort gave voice to a generation of doubters who would neither accept the &#x201c;straight story&#x201d; of scholastic science nor credulously embrace fantastical visions. Instead, Charles Fort demanded of his readers and admirers the most radical of human acts: Thinking.</p><p>'I am the first disciple of Charles Fort... henceforth, I am a Fortean" <p>Since Ben Hecht wrote this line in reviewing The Book of the Damned, Charles Fort has been an inspiration to the disaffected and curious, to &#x2018;alternative&#x2019; modern culture and to anyone seeking significance in chaos. </p><p>Fort provides the impetus for public interest in mysterious phenomena - he coined the word teleportation, gathered accounts of spontaneous human combustion, monsters, poltergeists, and what became known as UFO's. His legacy extends to conspiracy theories, science fiction and fantasy, graphic novels and film. He has been called &#x2018;prophet of the paranormal&#x2019; as well as &#x2018;patron saint of cranks&#x2019;, and today The Fortean Times is dedicated to &#x2018;Fortean reportage&#x2019;. Yet Fort was always more concerned with the mechanics of writing than with acolytes &#x2013; invited to become a member of the new &#x2018;Fortean society&#x2019; in 1931, Fort, true to form, refused.

What began as a counterinsurgency operation targeting 350 local rebels resulted in the deaths of roughly 30,000 uninvolved civilians, 10 percent of the island's population.</p><p>Su-kyoung Hwang's <i>Korea's Grievous War</i> recounts the civilian experience of anticommunist violence, beginning with the Cheju Uprising in 1948 and continuing through the Korean War until 1953. Wartime declarations of emergency by both the U.S. and Korean governments were issued to contain communism, but a major consequence of their actions was to contribute to the loss of more than two million civilian lives. Hwang inventories the persecutions of left-leaning intellectuals under the South Korean regime of Syngman Rhee and the executions of political prisoners and innocent civilians to "prevent" their collaboration with North Korea. She highlights the role of the United States in observing, documenting, and yet failing to intervene in the massacres and of the U.S. Air Force's three-year firebombing campaign in North and South Korea.</p><p>Hwang draws on archival research and personally conducted interviews to recount vividly the acts of anticommunist violence at the human level and illuminate the sufferings of civilian victims. <i>Korea's Grievous War</i> presents the historical background, political motivations, legal bases, and social consequences of anticommunist violence, tracing the enduring legacy of this destruction in the testimonies of survivors and bereaved families that only now can give voice to the lived experience of this grievous war and its aftermath.</p></p><p>Su-kyoung Hwang teaches Korean studies at the University of Sydney."Su-kyoung Hwang offers not just an invaluable work of historical recovery but also a work of relentless moral and scholarly bravery.

He is the author of three previous Jack McColl novels,&nbsp;<i>Jack of Spies</i>,<i> One Man's Flag</i>, and <i>Lenin&#x2019;s Roller Coaster</i>; the thriller&nbsp;<i>The Red Eagles</i>; and six books in the John Russell espionage series, set in WWII Berlin. He lives with his wife, an American acupuncturist, in Guildford, England.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> The Harrow courtroom was in a shabby condition; like so much else it was still waiting for a postwar recovery. The large expanses of wood paneling looked like they hadn&#x2019;t been polished for years, which was somewhat surprising given the number of people outside yearning for gainful employment.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The railing in front of Jack McColl was shiny enough, presumably greased by the sweating palms of previous defendants. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;d stood in a dock, but he&#x2019;d never been alone in one before, and for some reason the experience felt less stressful. Perhaps because he had only himself to worry about.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was glad his mother hadn&#x2019;t come down from Scotland. She had visited him in Pentonville a week or so earlier, and he had obviously convinced her that there was little point. He had refused her offer to pay for a better lawyer for much the same reason. Moral support was always nice, but she didn&#x2019;t have that much money to spare, and both of them knew it would have been wasted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere fact that the authorities had gone for a jury trial suggested, at least to McColl, that the outcome was a foregone conclusion, and that the Crown&#x2019;s chief concern was to maximize his sentence. The jury, of course, might prove awkward, but nothing in the faces of its members suggested any sympathy with his case. The judge, a white-haired man in his sixties, had been palpably hostile from the outset. According to one newspaper that McColl had seen, the judge was known as &#x201c;the Met&#x2019;s best friend,&#x201d; some accolade when London&#x2019;s police force was clearly spoiled for choice in that regard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And some choice when the alleged crime concerned the serious injuring of a policeman. The officer, PC Owen Standfast&#x2014;even the name seemed like an accusation&#x2014;was still, ten weeks later, in too frail a state to attend the court. Or so it was claimed. McColl had his doubts, but admitted he might be doing the man an injustice. It was, after all, his instant aversion to PC Standfast that had set his fist on its face-bound trajectory.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police constable had been well enough to recall and describe the events in question, and the middle-aged detective inspector now entering the witness box was armed with the interview transcript. He began by explaining the reasons for PC Standfast&#x2019;s nonappearance, and then announced, apropos of nothing, that the constable had decided on doctor&#x2019;s advice to take early retirement. When McColl&#x2019;s state-provided counsel protested that this statement might be prejudicial, the judge reluctantly agreed, and advised the jury to forget they had heard the offending words.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inspector started reading Standfast&#x2019;s testimony, his voice rather loud for the mostly empty courtroom, his tone suggesting a penchant for amateur dramatics. PC Standfast had first observed the vehicle&#x2014;a Ford Model T&#x2014;coming toward him on Preston Road at around four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. It had been traveling in the center of the highway at what he considered an excessive speed. Only a few seconds later it had abruptly swerved to the left and crashed through the plate-glass window of number 146, the Eternal Rest Funeral Parlour. PC Standfast had hurried toward the scene&#x2014;a distance of about a hundred yards&#x2014;worried that someone might be badly hurt, but on reaching the spot had found two men in the automobile&#x2019;s front seats laughing hysterically. The man behind the wheel, half of whose face was covered by one of those tin masks commonly worn by soldiers who&#x2019;d suffered facial disfigurement in the war, was so taken by the humor of the situation that he was rhythmically beating his hands on the steering wheel.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All true, McColl thought, aware of the stares of several jurors. His and Nate Simon&#x2019;s sudden confrontation with a window display of coffins had, at the time, seemed a joke of almost cosmic proportions. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I see you still find this amusing,&#x201d; the judge commented, noticing McColl&#x2019;s involuntary smile.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You had to be there,&#x201d; McColl replied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge gave him a contemptuous look and invited the inspector to continue. According to PC Standfast, he had been about to order the two men out of the automobile when he noticed that the driver, Nathaniel Simon, had no legs. The vehicle had been adapted for his use, hand levers bolted to the foot pedals in what appeared a highly slapdash manner.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mr. Simon chose to end his own life in police custody, I believe,&#x201d; the judge noted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;lud,&#x201d; the inspector said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;One might consider him the second victim,&#x201d; the judge went on, looking at the jury.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One could if one wanted to influence the verdict, McColl thought. Though only a fool would deny that Nate had been a victim.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking it unlikely that a man with no legs would step out of the car, PC Standfast had asked the man in the passenger seat to do so.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The defendant, Jack McColl?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;lud.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC Standfast had then asked Mr. McColl to help him get the driver out of the car. At which point Mr. McColl had punched PC Standfast in the face, causing him to fall backward and&#x2014;as he discovered much later&#x2014;to hit his head on the edge of the roadside curb. &#x201c;PC Standfast was in a coma for five weeks,&#x201d; the detective added helpfully.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was dismissed with fulsome thanks and the lack of any opportunity for the defense to question or challenge the absent witness blithely noted. Two other witnesses were duly heard and confirmed the basic outlines of the incident&#x2014;neither had been close enough to hear the exchange of words. By the time the second man left the stand, it was almost noon, and the judge was apparently hungry. The case for the defense would be heard that afternoon. <br>&nbsp; <br><br> <b>McColl was escorted back down </b>to the basement for his own feast&#x2014;a chunk of yesterday&#x2019;s bread with a slice of ham, washed down with a decent mug of tea. It was an improvement on the fare at Pentonville, to which he assumed he would soon be returning. He was resigned to a lengthy sentence, and much of the time was inclined to think he deserved one, if not for this particular crime. He had the feeling that things were finally catching up with him, that his ham-fisted search for atonement had been finally deemed insufficient by some nebulous higher authority.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was often the case at such moments, his thoughts went back to that day in Moscow, almost three years before. The anguished look on the young boy&#x2019;s face when McColl had told him he couldn&#x2019;t take him to England. Eleven-year-old Fedya, whom McColl had chanced across in a far-off village while on his way to Moscow, and whom he&#x2019;d taken with him partly for the camouflage that a child in tow would provide. Fedya, who had refused to take no for an answer, followed McColl from the orphanage, and then been caught in the middle when Cheka agents chasing McColl had recklessly opened fire. His old enemy Aidan Brady, then serving with the Moscow Cheka, had probably fired the fatal shot, but McColl had felt responsible. He had brought the boy to Moscow and stupidly put him at risk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That heartbreaking day in the summer of 1918 had been only the first of several&#x2014;in the months that followed his brother Jed had been taken by the Spanish flu, and Caitlin Hanley, the Irish-American love of McColl&#x2019;s life, had decided that the Russian Revolution meant more to her than he did. Her decision to stay on in Moscow had effectively ended their long on-off affair, and a subsequent letter had formalized the break. His career with the Secret Service had already ended after he&#x2019;d sabotaged a plot by the &nbsp;ervice&#x2019;s Russian allies to poison Moscow&#x2019;s food supply.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl and his mother had helped each other through their months of grief over Jed. In truth, she&#x2019;d been in much better shape than McColl had, and her continued immersion in the postwar radical politics of Glasgow&#x2019;s Clydeside had provided a focus that his own life lacked. Then in the spring of 1919, he&#x2019;d received a letter from London. Long before the war, in what seemed another age, McColl had met and married Evelyn Athelbury, and gone on to work for her brother Tim, a designer and manufacturer of luxury automobiles. It was the opportunities implicit in hawking these vehicles around the world that had first persuaded Mansfield Cumming, the head of Britain&#x2019;s new Secret Service, to enlist McColl as a part-time spy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already aware that Evelyn had died in the postwar flu epidemic, he had learned from the letter that her brother had recently succumbed to one of the more aggressive cancers. Before dying, Tim had advised his younger sister Eileen&#x2014;the letter&#x2019;s author and his sole beneficiary&#x2014;that she should seek McColl&#x2019;s advice on the future of the firm. Would he be willing to visit her in London and do as her brother had suggested?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl had been reluctant, but his mother had persuaded him that the change would do him good. Eileen, an attractive widow in her late thirties with a traumatized eleven-year-old son, had asked him if he could take a week or two to decide on which was the sensible course&#x2014;selling the firm outright or finding a new man to manage it for her. The business, as McColl soon realized, was nothing like its prewar self&#x2014;the days of small automobile manufacturers were rapidly drawing to an end, and Athelbury&#x2019;s was now little more than an upscale garage that specialized in servicing luxury cars. But the buildings were sound, the equipment mostly up-to-date, and the Swiss Cottage location a good one for the trade in question.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl had taken on its renaissance, hiring a one-armed mechanic named Sid whose skills were far greater than his own and making his home on the premises. He liked Eileen, and when she suggested they share the office cot, his body didn&#x2019;t get the argument that it probably should have. Over the next six months, they made love once or twice a week, and it was only when she suggested marriage that he realized how serious she was about him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn&#x2019;t face the responsibility, for her or her son, who sometimes even looked like Fedya, if only in McColl&#x2019;s imagination.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had built her a thriving business, and she let him go without any rancor. McColl had learned a lot from the one-armed mechanic and soon found another job at a garage in Wembley. With someone else doing all the paper work, he had more time for the disabled veterans&#x2019; group, which Sid had introduced him to, and spent much of his spare time ferrying men with missing limbs around London. On several occasions his passengers were bound for demonstrations outside Parliament or one of the ministries, and twice he found himself involved in skirmishes with the police.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for a passenger on one occasion, it occurred to him that a car could be adapted for disabled use. He arranged to meet Sid for lunch at a pub on the Finchley Road, and the two of them had enjoyed a long and liquid discussion of the possibilities. In the eight months since, they&#x2019;d experimented with all sorts of bespoke adaptions for the myriad forms of maiming suffered in the war, often in vain but sometimes with heartwarming success. The vehicle that Nate Simon had driven through the funeral parlor window had been one of their simpler jobs, and McColl was still at a loss as to what had gone wrong. He suspected that Nate&#x2014;not the sanest of men since losing half his face and limbs&#x2014;had done it deliberately, but now he would never know. Nate was beyond questioning, by McColl or the jury upstairs.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;I would like to take </b>you through Police Constable Standfast&#x2019;s statement to the police,&#x201d; the defense attorney began.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl nodded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He said that the car was traveling at excessive speed in the middle of the road. Do you agree?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;In the middle of the road, perhaps. There was, as far as I remember, no other vehicle in sight. At excessive speed? I would guess we were traveling at around twenty-five miles per hour, which few drivers would consider excessive in this day and age.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I think we can agree that the automobile took a sudden turn to the left, before mounting the pavement and crashing into the funeral parlor?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can you explain why that happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It certainly had nothing to do with the modifications we had made to the car. They were still in perfect working order.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; his counsel asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I used them myself to drive the constable to hospital.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what do you think happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl hesitated. He was reluctant to point the finger at Nate Simon, because of how it might reflect on other disabled drivers, but the truth was the truth. &#x201c;I think Nate&#x2014;Mr. Simon&#x2014;had a moment of madness. He saw the sign above the funeral home&#x2014;&#x2018;the best care for your loved ones&#x2019;&#x2014;and something just snapped.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Were you &#x2018;laughing hysterically&#x2019; when PC Standfast arrived on the scene?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We were. It just seemed so appropriate somehow, after everything that happened in the war, to find ourselves literally in death&#x2019;s lap. It wasn&#x2019;t as if anyone had been hurt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Quite. So what happened next?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mr. Simon took off his mask, something he often did when confronted by figures of authority.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;With the intention of upsetting the person in question,&#x201d; the judge interjected, with only the slightest hint of inquiry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl took it in his stride. &#x201c;He liked to make people aware of the sacrifices he and others had made for their country.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But a provocative act, nonetheless,&#x201d; the judge insisted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; McColl said dryly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge considered another verbal intervention, but opted instead for simply shaking his head.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How did PC Standfast react?&#x201d; the defense counsel asked McColl.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He blanched. Which was not an unusual reaction&#x2014;Mr. Simon&#x2019;s face was quite shocking at first sight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And did he ask you to help him get Mr. Simon out of the automobile?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;In a manner of speaking. He said: &#x2018;Get this monster out of the car.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Those were the exact words he used?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Coming of Conan: The Cimmerian</h2><p>Here are timeless tales featuring Conan the raw and dangerous youth, Conan the daring thief, Conan the swashbuckling pirate, and Conan the commander of armies.

With all the bravado of a young man on his own for the first time, the scrawny 14-year-old travels parallel to the expedition, not revealing himself until he's confident he will be accepted as a member. His literacy is attributed to education by Catholic priests, but his perspective and voice are not consistently in character. For example, he proudly enthuses about the "naming of America" by the Corps, but with his Native American heritage he would have been aware that there were Indian names for the many places the expedition "discovered." In other instances, he is given greater awareness than is credible for a mixed-heritage frontier lad. Lasky's ample talent is constricted here by the dictum of the series. She uses the inherent drama and well-documented account of Lewis and Clark's journey as the backbone for the story. While Gus brings an engaging young person's perspective to history, it can be jarring when he is inserted into well-known occurrences of the expedition, e.g., having him rescue Sacajawea's baby in the flash flood at the Great Falls of the Missouri. The story is followed by a historical note sketching the outline of the Corps of Discovery journey, complemented by period illustrations and photographs of expedition paraphernalia. It has been noted that this series is historical fiction, not history; this caution seems particularly relevant with The Journal of Augustus Pelletier.<br><i> Nancy Collins-Warner, Neill Public Library, Pullman, WA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Jupiter Myth (A Marcus Didius Falco Novel)</h2><p>For Falco, a relaxed visit to Helena&#39;s relatives in Britain turns serious at the scene of a downtown murder.

This time, a visit to in-laws in the backwater of Londinium, Britannia, leads to murder, intrigue, and a diplomatic crisis. The humor marking the earlier Falco adventures seems muted here, possibly because narrator Christian Rodska ignores much of it. He reads accurately, if not with much variety, in a London accent and slightly strident timbre. Fortunately, his approach--not too light, not too heavy--lets much of the book's charm and color shine through.

Sometimes they canbe benefactors and helpers; ofttimes, tricksters; but always, creatures of sublime beauty and wonder. Here, in a sparkling collection, are Michael Hague's favorite fairy poems, illuminated by pictures from this master painter of fantasy. His fanciful artwork has never looked more otherworldly or beautiful.</p></p><p><p>Michael Hague has illustrated more than thirty children's classics, including memorable editions of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>, <em>Peter Pan</em>, <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, and <em>The Secret Garden</em>. He is also the artist of several bestselling books by his wife, Kathleen, including <em>Alphabears</em>, <em>Numbears</em>, and <em>Ten Little Bears</em>. The father of three grown children and the grandfather of four, Michael has a ready audience for all of his work. </p>Kindergarten-Grade 5&#x2013;Filled with the stunning illustrations we've come to expect from Hague, this oversize collection is divided into four thematic chapters: "Where Fairies Dance," "Fairy Justice," "The Road to Fairyland," and "Fairy Helpers." Within each section are poems of varying length, all of which have language as rich and varied as the art. Poets represented include Shakespeare, Rachel Field, Walter de la Mare, Sir Walter Scott, and Annie R. Rentoul. Each selection creates a world in which fairies, elves, goblins, and other fantastical creatures coincide easily with the children who see them and believe in them. Similar in style to Cicely Mary Barker's <i>The Complete Book of the Flower Fairies</i> (Penguin, 1997), Hague's beautiful illustrations portray a much more realized world that exists among the treetops, deep within the earth and roots, and in the stars above us. This is a world with tiny creatures flitting among green leaves, enormous gnarled trees, and frothy waves; these beings, both beautiful and fearsome, beckon to children on every page.&#x2013;<i>Jane Marino, Bronxville Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Riverhead Books will publish this collection in 2005.</p>By copping the title of William Empson's classic of literary criticism, Australian writer Perlman (<i>Three Dollars</i>) sets a high bar for himself, but he justifies his theft with a relentlessly driven story, told from seven perspectives, about the effects of the brief abduction of six-year-old Sam Geraghty by Simon Heywood, his mother Anna's ex-boyfriend. Charismatic, unemployed Simon is still obsessed with Anna nine years after their breakup&#x2014;to the dismay of his present lover, Angelique, a prostitute. Anna's stockbroker husband, Joe, is one of Angelique's regulars, which feeds Simon's flame. When Angelique turns Simon in to the cops, he claims he had permission to pick Sam up; his fate hinges on whether Anna will back up his lie. Most of the perspectives are linked to Simon's shrink, Alex Klima, who writes to Anna and counsels Simon, Angelique and Joe's co-worker, Dennis. The most successful voices belong to Joe, who's spent his career on the edge of panic, and Dennis, whose bitter rants provide a corrective to Klima's unctuous psychological omniscience. Perlman, a lawyer, aims for a literary legal novel&#x2014;think Grisham by way of Franzen&#x2014;and the ambition is admirable though the product somewhat uneven. Simon's obsessions, his self-righteousness and his psychological blackmail, give him a perhaps unintended creepiness, and the novel, as big and juicy as it is, may not offer sufficient closure. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the Minuit purchase until pollution finally destroyed the beds in the 1920s, New York was a city known for its oysters, especially in the late 1800s, when Europe and America enjoyed a decades-long oyster craze. In a dubious endorsement, William Makepeace Thackeray said that eating a New York oyster was like eating a baby. Travellers to New York were also keen to experience the famous New York oyster houses. While some were known for their elegance, due to a longstanding belief in the aphrodisiac quality of oysters, they were often associated with prostitution. In 1842, when the novelist Charles Dickens arrived in New York, he could not conceal his eagerness to find and experience the fabled oyster cellars of New York City&#39;s slums. &#34;The Big Oyster&#34; is the story of a city and of an international trade.

His employer, Holland, would soon be in its golden age, offering the world Rembrandt, the microscope, and the stock exchange, but not, as Hudson and his sponsors had hoped, a river through North America leading to China.<br><br> A water route to Chinese trade replacing the long, arduous Silk Road was a great dream of the Renaissance. The only alternative ever found was in 1499 when Vasco da Gama sailed from Portugal and went around Africa to the Indian Ocean. All of the westward voyages of exploration had ended in failure, with endless landmasses standing in the way between Europe and China. Cabot was stopped by Canada in the north, Verrazano was stopped by the United States farther south, Columbus by Central America in the middle, and Magellan showed that it was a hopelessly long way around South America to the south. Only one idea still held any possibility and that was a passage through arctic waters.<br><br> And so Hudson was essentially an arctic explorer. In fact, he was a failed arctic explorer. On his first voyage for the British he sailed straight north, attempting to travel beyond the ice and down the other side of the globe. The plan was geographically astute but meteorologically absurd and he was stopped by ice. At the point he could go no farther, his seventy-foot wooden vessel was only six hundred miles short of Robert E. Peary&#x2019;s 1909 achievement, reaching the North Pole. His second voyage, heading northeast over Russia, was also stopped by ice. At this point his British sponsor, the Muscovy Company, dropped him.<br><br> A new idea came along. In the early seventeenth century, Captain John Smith, the ruggedly handsome legendary adventurer famous for his conquests both military and sexual, was the great promoter of European settlement in North America. He charted the coastline, reported on his findings, and pitched North America to any Englishman who would listen. He was to play a role in the promoting of Britain&#x2019;s two leading North American colonies, Virginia and Massachusetts. Hudson knew Smith and they corresponded in 1608, by which time four-fifths of Smith&#x2019;s 1607 Virginia settlers had already died. There was a growing belief that North America was uninhabitable in the winter. But Smith&#x2019;s contagious enthusiasm never faltered. Not only did he believe in North American settlement&#x2014;this entire debate taking place as if no one was already living there&#x2014;but his maps and letters to Hudson promoted an alternative to the theory that a water route to China could be found north of Canada&#x2014;the so-called Northwest Passage. Smith&#x2019;s theory was that somewhere north of Virginia a major river connected the Atlantic to the Sea of Cathay.<br><br> This is a case of people hearing only what they want to hear. Smith&#x2019;s Chinese sea was presumably the Pacific Ocean, but rivers are not known to flow from one sea to another. Smith&#x2019;s theory was based on statements from northern tribes who trapped for fur. They talked of an ocean that could be reached from a river. They probably said nothing about Cathay, China, which was an obsession of Europeans, not North Americans. It seems likely that the North Americans were talking about how they could travel up the Hudson and follow the Mohawk tributary and with a short land portage&#x2014;for a canoe&#x2014;arrive at the Great Lakes. Standing on the shore of Lake Erie, one can have the impression of being on the coast of a vast sea. Furthermore, the currents of the Hudson are so multidirectional, the salty ocean water travels so far inland, that according to Indian legend, the first inhabitants came to the Hudson in search of a river that ran two ways, as though it flowed into seas at both ends. Whether such early Indian explorers existed, the Europeans came looking for exactly that.<br><br> Hudson, the out-of-work explorer, had something to sell: a possible new passage to China. The Muscovy Company had listened and voted against the project. But Britain&#x2019;s new and fast-growing competitor, Holland, was interested. The Vernenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC, known in English as the Dutch East India Company, hired him. The Dutch were not interested in new theories from John Smith or Henry Hudson. They hired Hudson to search for the northeastern passage, a route through the ice floes north of Russia. Hudson had no faith in this northeastern theory, but the VOC gave him a commission with a new ship, and so he took it and sailed north until well out of the view of Dutchmen. Then he picked up a westerly gale and crossed the Atlantic, thousands of miles in the opposite direction of his orders, and reached the North American coast off Newfoundland.<br><br> More than a century after John Cabot&#x2019;s voyage, this was a well-known route. Hudson then followed the coastline south to Cape Hatteras and the mouth of the Chesapeake within miles of his friend Smith at Jamestown but, sailing in a Dutch vessel, did not visit the British settlement. Perhaps he needed to locate Smith&#x2019;s Jamestown to find his bearing on Smith&#x2019;s maps. Then he began exploring the coastline for a river to China.<br><br> In this search he became the first European to enter Delaware Bay. But seeing the shallow waters, shoals, and bars at the mouth of the Delaware, Hudson felt certain that this was not a river great enough to cut through North America to China. He continued on, viewing the forest lands of an unknown continent off the port side, seemingly uninhabited, with only an occasional bird chirp for counterpoint to the rolling surf on sandy beaches and the creaks in the Half Moon&#x2019;s rigging.<br><br> Then, rounding a flat, sandy, narrow peninsula, today accurately labeled Sandy Hook, Hudson and his men, almost as if falling through a keyhole, found themselves in another world. The wide expanse of water, one hundred square miles, lay flat, sheltered by the bluffs of Staten Island and the rolling hills of Brooklyn. Sandy Hook on the port and the shoals of Rockaway Peninsula on the starboard, an ideal barrier furnished with several channels, protected the opening. When they looked into the water, they could see large fish following them.<br><br> This was the place. From all directions they saw rivers pouring into the bay. If there were a chasm in the heart of North America opening up a waterway all the way to China, this is what it would look like.<br> Hudson identified three &#x201c;great rivers.&#x201d; They were probably Raritan Bay, which separates New Jersey and Staten Island, the opening to the Upper Harbor, and the Rockaway Inlet on the Brooklyn&#x2013;Queens shore of Long Island. He had not yet sailed through the narrow opening between Staten Island and Brooklyn&#x2014;not yet seen the Upper Bay, the Hudson River, the Harlem River, and the East River that connects with Long Island Sound. He had not yet seen the lush, green, rocky island of ponds and streams in the middle of the estuary.<br><br> Hudson sent a landing party ashore on Staten Island. It was late summer and the plum trees and grapevines were bearing fruit. Immediately upon landing, as though Hudson&#x2019;s crew had been expected, as though invited, people dressed in animal skins appeared to welcome them. These people in animal skins saw that the leader of the people who arrived in the floating house wore a red coat that sparkled with gold lace.<br><br> In what would become a New York tradition, commerce instantly began. The Europeans in red had tools, while the skin-clad Americans offered hemp, beans, and a local delicacy&#x2014;oysters. The Europeans thought they were getting much better value than they were giving, but the Americans may have thought the same thing.<br><br> Hudson and his men had no idea with whom they were trading. They reported that the people in skins were friendly and polite but not to be trusted. These people the Europeans distrusted called their land Lenapehoking, the land of the Lenape. The Lenape thought they knew their visitors. They were a people they called in their language shouwunnock, which meant &#x201c;Salty People.&#x201d; The grandparents of the Lenape who saw Hudson may have seen an earlier Salty Person, the Italian, Giovanni da Verrazano, sailing the coast with his crew for Francis I, king of France, in 1524. Verrazano had chosen to moor his ship off Staten Island, farther up than Hudson, in the narrow opening that bears his name and where Staten Island is now connected to Brooklyn by a bridge. Verrazano could see the second interior bay with its wide rivers and well-placed island and described the bay as &#x201c;a pleasant lake.&#x201d; He named it Santa Margarita after the sister of his patron, Francis. &#x201c;We passed up with our boat only into the said river, and saw the country very well peopled. The people are almost like unto the others, and clad with feathers of fowls of divers colors. They came toward us very cheerfully, making great shouts of admiration, showing us where we might come to land most safely with our boat.&#x201d;<br><br> But soon shifting winds forced the Europeans, with great reluctance, to return to their ship and sail on. This was probably the first sighting of Salty People by the inhabitants of the harbor, although their grandparents may also hav...</p><h2>Cautionary Verses / New Cautionary Verses (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This series offers a superb collection of th e world&#39;&#39;s greatest children&#39;&#39;s books and their classic illust rations in handsome, full cloth hardcover editions. &#39;</p><p>Hilaire Belloc was born in France and educated at Newman&#39;s Oratory School and at Balliol College, Oxford. From 1906 to 1910 he was Liberal MP for Salford and literary editor of the Morning Post. As well as writing books of verse and novels, he also wrote on religious, social and political topics.Adult/High School-Tales is written in the style of a picture book, with sprightly little rhymes that speak of the foibles of children and the horrible consequences thereof. First penned nearly a century ago, the sort of story that Belloc parodies continues to be written today and read to youngsters, but readers who are more sophisticated will better appreciate these tales of disproportionate punishment. Children are whimsically eaten by lions or consigned to life as a bootblack for their sins-or, by contrast, a boy who fires a loaded gun at his sister is reprimanded sternly. Gorey's artfully antiquated style exactly fits Belloc's writing and brings this edition to life-a single pen-and-ink line shows the sister's satisfaction at hearing her brother called to task. The previously unpublished illustrations meticulously convey texture, such as the clothing of the myriad physicians called in to help poor Henry King who swallowed string, and the expressions of the self-satisfied adults seem so earnestly and seriously drawn as to make the whole that much more humorous. The art is refined and genteel-never gory.

It includes the first complete publication of Simple Simon, the detective series featuring Crowley&#39;s most memorable fictional creation, the mystic-magician-philosopher-psychoanalyst-detective Simon Iff. The idealised Crowley in old age, Simon Iff is wise, knowing and unfailingly humorous as he applied psychoanalysis, Taoism and his own religious philosophy of Thelema to divine the depths of human nature and solve a wide array of crimes and mysteries. The six Scrutinies of Simon Iff stories are set in France and England, anchored by Iff&#39;s beloved Hemlock Club. The twelve Simon Iff in America stories afford Crowley&#39;s penetrating insights into America as he found it during his residence from 1914 to 1919. His three Simon Iff Abroad stories take the reader to tribal North Africa, inaccessible Central Africa and to the high seas. The two Simon Iff Psychoanalyst stories were among the earliest tales to use the new science of psychoanalysis to solve mysteries. Also included is Crowley&#39;s other major short fiction series, the eight stories of his legendary Golden Twigs, which were inspired by Sir J.G. Frazer&#39;s encyclopedic study of myth and religion in history, The Golden Bough.</p><p>Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), who claimed to be the re-incarnation of Dr. John Dee among others, lived in England from 1875 through 1947.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Murakami lived abroad until 1995. That year, two disasters struck Japan: the lethal earthquake in Kobe and the deadly poison gas attacks in the Tokyo subway. Spurred by these tragic events, Murakami returned home. The stories in <i>After the Quake</i> are set in the months that fell between the earthquake and the subway attack, presenting a world marked by despair, hope, and a kind of human instinct for transformation. A teenage girl and a middle-aged man share a hobby of making beach bonfires; a businesswoman travels to Thailand and, quietly, confronts her own death; three friends act out a modern-day Tokyo version of <i>Jules and Jim</i>. There's a surreal element running through the collection in the form of unlikely frogs turning up in unlikely places. News of the earthquake hums throughout. The book opens with the dull buzz of disaster-watching: "Five straight days she spent in front of the television, staring at the crumbled banks and hospitals, whole blocks of stores in flames, severed rail lines and expressways." With language that's never self-consciously lyrical or show-offy, Murakami constructs stories as tight and beautiful as poems. There's no turning back for his people; there's only before and after the quake. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>&#x201c;Ushers the reader into a hallucinatory world where the real and surreal merge and overlap, where dreams and real-life nightmares are impossible to tell apart.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;His characters are so persuasive, and the storytelling so spacious. . . .

He is a columnist for the Washington Post, an author, is a guest commentator on NPR, and does color commentary for United States Naval Academy football games. He is also a frequent contributor to The Tony Kornheiser Show. During a radio broadcast of the football game between the Naval Academy and Duke University on October 1, 2005, Feinstein blurted an obscenity over-the-air in response to what he perceived to be a bad call on the field. He immediately removed himself from the rest of the broadcast, except to return at the end to apologize on the air. Although he offered his resignation to the Naval Academy, they rejected it because of his contrition and have invited him to continue to participate in future broadcasts. Feinstein was a sports writer for the The Chronicle while enrolled at Duke University, where he graduated in 1977. One of Feinstein&#39;s nicknames is &#34;Junior&#34;, despite not having the suffix in his name. The name was given by Tony Kornheiser because of the similarities in his temper to John McEnroe. Feinstein sometimes fills in as a guest host on The Jim Rome Show. Rome considers Feinstein to be one of the most intelligent people he&#39;s interviewed on the show, and occasionally teases him about an over-the-phone interview that was interrupted by Feinstein&#39;s daughter.*Starred Review* Through 16 books in his genre-defining, year-in-the-life style, Feinstein avoided tackling pro football, feeling that the legendary lack of access granted the media by the NFL's powerful owners and general managers made his approach impossible. That changed when fortysomething Steve Bisciotti bought the Baltimore Ravens, and Feinstein was able to convince him, as well as Ravens coach Brian Billick and general manager Ossie Newsome, to do the unthinkable: allow a writer complete access to the team and its management throughout an entire season. The 2004 NFL season looked to be a good one for the Ravens, who had won the Super Bowl in 2001 and seemed primed to return to the top. It didn't turn out that way, which gives Feinstein's account an extra dimension of tension, on top of the fly-on-the-wall fascination of sitting in on coaches' strategy meetings and listening as decisions are made on who to start and who to cut. To most fans, who mainly see football players encased in helmets and pads, it's hard even to project the human side of their lives; Feinstein offers us this opportunity, showing the day-to-day rigors of the marginal player, hoping only to avoid being cut. The specter of injuries, an ominous inevitability in football, gets a human face, too, as the Ravens suffer debilitating blow after blow. Football has never seemed as personal as it does here, in one of Feinstein's most involving books. Best-sellerdom is a foregone conclusion. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Dave Delano, the protagonist of this lively thriller, is an American who's educated himself in prison--serving a sentence for a manslaughter he didn't commit. Newly fluent in Russian, he's intrigued by the idea of redistributing wealth, particularly the Mafia's. His plan is to hijack a transatlantic transport ferry/yacht being used to smuggle drug money and to divert the dollars into his very own bank in the former Soviet Union. It all seems flawless until he meets another Grand Duke passenger who's looking to score: Kate Fury, a gorgeous FBI agent who's been tracking cocaine from Colombia to Miami to the European playgrounds of the rich and expecting the biggest collar of her career. What happens when they cross paths is the stuff of a funny, violent, and oddly romantic caper. The plot twists fast enough to satisfy even die-hard Elmore Leonard fans and turns on double dealing, false identities, and misunderstood motives, without letting the humor get in the way of the action. <i>--Jane Adams</i>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Fundamentals of Composition (ENGLISH edition)</h2><p>This is the ENGLISH edition.

Finally, here is an accessible but authoritative series that every Christian can turn to: The Baker History of the Church. In the first volume of this series, readers explored the first three hundred years of church history using the most recent biblical research and historical scholarship. Now, A Public Faith covers the years AD 312 - 600, explaining how the church defended itself against unorthodox views and clarified its definitions of Jesus Christ. Bringing the story into the present, this highly readable series shows how the worship, ministry, and theology of the early church have developed into forms still recognized today.</p><p>The Baker History of the Church is a multivolume series by world-renowned historians and theologians. Each comprehensive volume offers an evenhanded and readable assessment of the main strands of Christianity within its period. A Public Faith covers the period AD 312-600. These centuries saw the official favoring of the Christian faith in the Roman Empire and the expansion of Christianity in western Europe as well as in the Mediterranean region, Asia, and Africa. This era also witnessed the fragmentation of the political world in which the church began. Examining the challenges and opportunities generated by change, consolidation, and growth, Ivor J. Davidson assesses the complex but fascinating ways in which Christianity developed during these dramatic times.

After the horrors of the war, Victor and Eva&#x2019;s return to their Dresden home seems like a fairytale. Victor tries to resume his distinguished academic career and joins East Germany&#x2019;s Communist Party. In 1951, Eva dies; a year later, aged 70, Victor marries a student an unlikely but successful love match. But with the growing repression of the Communist Party, and the memory of those who did not survive, Victor&#x2019;s achievements ring hollow. Politics, he comes to believe, is, above all, the choice of the lesser evil.&#x201d; A masterpiece both of Holocaust literature and memoir.</p><p>Born in 1881, Victor Klemperer studied in Munich, Geneva and Paris. He was a journalist in Berlin, taught at the University of Naples and received a DSM during WWI as a volunteer in the German army. He was subsequently a professor of romance languages at the Dresden Technical College until he was dismissed as a consequence of Nazi laws in 1935. He survived the Holocaust and the war and taught again as an academic until his death in 1960.This third and final volume of the diaries of Klemperer, a German-Jewish professor of philology who survived the Nazis because his wife was Christian, lacks the inherent drama of his life under the Nazis, related in the first two, highly acclaimed volumes, and many readers will be mystified by the political twists and turns of East German communism. Nonetheless, Klemperer was an acute observer of life's complexities, and the diary becomes quite a good read. In 1945, he is amazed that he has survived, but the conditions of life are still wrenching. He is suspicious of all the former acquaintances who shunned him in the Nazi years and now fawn over him. As a privileged academic in Communist East Germany, Klemperer attends endless, mind-numbing meetings, but also receives a number of appointments, a good salary and a cherished automobile. He publishes his most important work,<i> LTI,</i> a study of Nazi language. As someone who had suffered so acutely under the Nazis, he believes communism is "the lesser evil," yet he is anguished by the parallels between Nazism and communism. The diary is a poignant document about life under communism and the political choices that so many Europeans faced after WWII. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This remarkable story of hardship and suffering was long lost and only recently discovered by the author. On Christmas Eve, 1896, the New York World reported her arrival.

Helga&#39;s adventure and its sad conclusion is well captured in this beautifully designed book. An excellant selection for a book club.In 1896, a Norwegian immigrant and mother of eight children named Helga Estby was behind on taxes and the mortgage when she learned that a mysterious sponsor would pay $10,000 to a woman who walked across America. <br>Hoping to win the wager and save her family's farm, Helga and her teenaged daughter Clara, armed with little more than a compass, red-pepper spray, a revolver, and Clara's curling iron, set out on foot from Eastern Washington. Their route would pass through 14 states, but they were not allowed to carry more than five dollars each. As they visited Indian reservations, Western boomtowns, remote ranches and local civic leaders, they confronted snowstorms, hunger, thieves and mountain lions with equal aplomb. <br>Their treacherous and inspirational journey to New York challenged contemporary notions of femininity and captured the public imagination.

He attended Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in Kent, England, on scholarship. Baker acted in repertory theaters around Britain until the late 1960s when he joined up with the National Theatre.

Gresham Machen published in the earlier &#39;Christianity Today&#39; from January 1931 to February 1933. Students at Westminster Seminary have made profitable use of these Notes on Galatians 1:1 - 3:14 by following them, with minor inconveience, through bound periodical volumes; but for many others who might greatly benefit from them, they have long been inaccessible. Here you will find a master exegete opening up important and essential meterial to help undertsand the import of the great Apoostle on this vital portion of Scripture. &#34;Machen wrote on Galatians to inform his students and to help Sunday School teachers. It is written with delightful clarity and incidentally introduces us to what Machen did very well, teach the New Testament to students at Princeton and Westminster Seminaries. It is wonderfully lucid; a pleasure to read; a model for anyone who preaches the Bible.&#34; - Geoff Thomas</p><p></p><h2>Fire in My Belly: Real Cooking</h2><p>Step into the kitchen with beloved chef and 2016 James Beard Award nominee for Best Chef Southeast, Kevin Gillespie, whose deep commitment, passion, and skill shine throughout this approachable cookbook.

Often, they leave the "big" money matters to the men in their lives, or they put off making important financial decisions that could affect their lifestyles down the road.<br><br>Now, in <b>Smart Women Finish Rich</b>, David Bach finally gives women the tools and the program they need to create rich futures. A renowned financial advisor who has coached thousands of people looking for financial security, Bach has developed a proven system for women that can make them better financial planners than men.<br><br>Bach has found that women tend to be naturally great investors when they learn to tap into their values. He has discovered that while men tend to focus on earning money for "things"--cars, boats, golf gear, etc.--and frequently switch stocks in their portfolios, women who prioritize their "values"--security, freedom, and education--are able to commit easily to a long-term savings and investment plan to build futures they really want.<br><br>Whether you're working with a few dollars a week, a significant inheritance, or a savings account that's been earning just 3 percent, the <b>Smart Women Finish Rich</b> approach toward saving and investing can provide a huge payoff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure your financial future and achieve your dreams by following these seven steps:<br><br>1. Learn the facts and myths about your money.<br>2. Put your money where your values are.<br>3. Figure out where you stand financially... and where you want to go.<br>4. Use the power of the latt� factor to create massive wealth on just a few dollars a week.<br>5. Practice Grandma's three-basket approach to financial security.<br>6. Learn the nine biggest mistakes investors make and how to avoid them.<br>7. Follow the twelve commandments of attracting greater wealth.<br><br>These seven easy steps will transform your relationship with money, and <b>Smart Women Finish Rich</b> will put you in control of your finances and your future.</p><p>David Bach's <i>Smart Women Finish Rich</i> is a homage to the financial wisdom of his grandmother; it's also an excellent foundation for women who are starting to get their financial lives in order. Bach's approach to money management is rooted in years of investment seminars for women and his work as senior vice president of investments at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. During that time he recognized that "people rarely know what is truly driving them emotionally when it comes to money." In response, Bach has written a guide to money management for women based on his belief that "financial planning is as much an emotional issue as it is an intellectual one." Are you considering your values in your work and investing? What part of your daily work is driven by your goals in life? Is your latte habit preventing you from accumulating substantial wealth? Bach addresses tax strategies, wills, insurance, retirement plans, and investments in a highly accessible manner. <i>Smart Women Finish Rich</i> ably bridges the gap between simple saving strategies and preparing for widowhood and financial independence. <i>--Brad Doll</i>Praise for SMART WOMEN FINISH RICH: <p>"Smart Women Finish Rich inspires women to start planning today for a secure financial future.

Tracy Hickman lives in Utah.</p>CHAPTER<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Keeper?&#x201d; Sigurd asked, peering down into the hold.<br>&#x201c;Dead,&#x201d; said Skylan.<br>His comrades stared at him in shocked silence. Then some of the men glanced grimly at the ogre ships with their triangular sails that were approaching them cautiously, wary, no doubt, of the reputation of the Vindrasi dragonships.<br>Other men watched Raegar sailing after them in his new dragonship, <i>Aelon&#x2019;s Triumph,</i> that he had ordered built along the same lines as the fabled dragonships of his cousins. Raegar&#x2019;s ship was dedicated to the God of the New Dawn, Aelon. His dragon, Fala, was dedicated to the new god, as well. Both of them were traitors to the Vindrasi and the Old Gods, the true gods.<br>&#x201c;So what do we do now?&#x201d; Sigurd demanded, breaking the silence.<br>&#x201c;We stand together,&#x201d; said Skylan.<br>Sigurd snorted. &#x201c;You mean we die together.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better than dying alone,&#x201d; said Skylan. &#x201c;Like Keeper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How did our Keeper die?&#x201d; asked Legate Acronis, frowning. He had known the ogre godlord a long time and although they were nominally slave and master, the two had long been friends. &#x201c;He had a cracked head, nothing for an ogre with their thick skulls.&#x201d;<br>Skylan&#x2019;s gaze flicked to Aylaen. Worn out after her battle with the Vektia dragon, she was sitting on the deck, slumped back against the bulkhead. He and Aylaen had fled Sinaria disguised as the military escort for Legate Acronis and they were both wearing the segmented armor worn by the Sinarian soldiers, as well as the breastplate and the leather skirt that was too big for her slender waist. Aylaen had removed the helm, claiming that she couldn&#x2019;t see properly. Her legs were bare from her thighs to her tightly laced boots. Skylan was surprised her stepfather, Sigurd, hadn&#x2019;t berated her for exposing her body in such an unseemly manner. Perhaps Sigurd had given up the fight to salvage his wayward daughter&#x2019;s honor. She had, after all, just saved his life. Skylan hoped Aylaen was asleep.<br>She wasn&#x2019;t. Hearing the news of Keeper&#x2019;s death, she opened her eyes wide and pushed herself to her feet.<br>&#x201c;Keeper&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d; she said in dismay. &#x201c;How did he die? What happened?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How he died doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Skylan said in flat, dry tones. &#x201c;What matters is how <i>we</i> die. If Raegar captures us, he will take us back to Sinaria and slavery.&#x201d;<br>Skylan held out his arm, still bloody from where the blessed sword of Vindrash had slashed through the tattoo that had branded him a slave. &#x201c;For myself, I choose the ogres.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The brutes will board our ship to find one of their godlords dead,&#x201d; Erdmun pointed out. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll think we killed him. They&#x2019;ll butcher us.&#x201d;<br>Skylan sighed. Erdmun could always be counted on to take a negative view of the situation. Though Skylan had to admit, in this instance there wasn&#x2019;t much positive.<br>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;re going to just sit here and wait for death,&#x201d; Sigurd said, scowling.<br>&#x201c;We will not sit here. We will pray,&#x201d; Aylaen said. &#x201c;We will turn to our gods.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Our gods have been such a big help to us up to now,&#x201d; Erdmun sneered.<br>Aylaen angrily rounded on Erdmun.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re still alive,&#x201d; she said, her green eyes flashing. She pointed back to the city, to the smoke that blacked the sky and the orange flames that burned so fiercely not even the torrential rains could douse them. &#x201c;The people in that city cannot say as much. We are alive and we are free. We have our ship and we have our dragon and we have each other.&#x201d;<br>The men were listening to her. She was wet and bedraggled, her face smeared with grime and soot, her red curls plastered to her head. She was a mess, but to Skylan she was beautiful. He had never loved her more than he loved her now, and he had loved Aylaen all his life.<br>&#x201c;Our gods fight for their survival even as we fight for ours,&#x201d; Aylaen continued. &#x201c;They have given us what help they can. The rest we must do for ourselves.&#x201d;<br>The men were impressed. Aylaen turned to face the carved figurehead of the dragon that proudly graced the prow of the <i>Venjekar</i>. Kahg&#x2019;s eyes glittered red. The dragon had refused to fight Raegar&#x2019;s dragon, Fala, saying he would not fight one of his own kind, no matter that she served a treacherous god. Kahg had not abandoned them, however. The dragon was with them, sailing the dragonship, imbuing the ship with his spirit.<br>Aylaen began praying to Vindrash, the dragon goddess, thanking her for her blessings, for her help in saving them from a Vektia dragon. Skylan was proud of her, proud of her courage, her strength. She had become a Bone Priestess reluctantly, led to the decision by a lie that held more truth for her than she wanted to admit.<br>&#x201c;Vindrash,&#x201d; Aylaen said in conclusion, gazing up at the heavens tinged with smoke. &#x201c;We need a miracle.&#x201d;<br>Skylan said his own prayer. He did not pray to Vindrash. Now that the Dragon Goddess had given him the secret to the Five Vektia dragons, Skylan hoped she was done with him, that she had punished him enough and there would be no more horror-ridden dragonbone games played night after dreadful night with the draugr of his dead wife, Draya. Skylan had worked hard to make amends for his past misdeeds. Aylaen was a Bone Priestess now. She and Vindrash could commune and leave Skylan out of it. He clasped his hand over his amulet, the silver hammer he wore around his neck.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a miracle, Torval. I need a favor. I need time,&#x201d; Skylan said beneath his breath. &#x201c;Anything that will gain me more time. Do that, and we can handle the rest.&#x201d;<br>His prayer dispatched, Skylan looked with concern at his warriors. They had escaped Sinaria aboard the <i>Venjekar,</i> hauling the ship overland until they reached the river and then launching it. They were wearing the traditional armor of the Torgun, &#x201c;barbaric armor,&#x201d; the Sinarians termed it&#x2014;leather tunics, padded leather vests, and chain mail, newly made for the Para Dix games. Some wore swords, others carried axes, depending on their preference. Skylan, as a Sinarian soldier, carried a standard-issue sword; a weapon neither good nor bad.<br>Sigurd&#x2019;s head was bowed in prayer, but Skylan thought he was only pretending. Sigurd cast darting glances at the ogre ship from out of the corner of his eye. Grimuir, his friend and ally (allied in their dislike of Skylan), was watching Raegar&#x2019;s ship. Acronis, former Legate of the doomed city of Sinaria, did not bow his head. Skylan knew he did not believe in gods, in any gods. His only beloved daughter had died yesterday. His beautiful home had been burned to the ground. His city was still in flames; the smoke from the burning buildings crept over the water, stinging the throat and eyes. He had lost everything except his life and he must hold that life very cheap right now, for he had tried to kill himself. Small wonder he turned his back on the gods, who had turned their backs on him. He was dressed in his ceremonial Sinarian armor, his finely made sword at his side. He gazed out across the restless sea and scratched his grizzled chin.<br>Bjorn seemed to pray in earnest; Erdmun prayed, Skylan was sure, because he was hedging his bets. Farinn, the youngest of them all, looked as if he prayed fervently through lips that trembled.<br>Farinn is afraid of death, Skylan realized. And he imagines he is alone in his fear. I must remember to give him some task to keep him occupied.<br>The ship was quiet, the only sounds the waves slapping against the hull and the murmurs of men praying. Wulfe, the fae child, son (so he claimed) of the daughter of the Faerie Queen, sidled up to Skylan and announced in a loud voice, &#x201c;Treia murdered Keeper.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; Skylan clapped his hand over Wulfe&#x2019;s mouth, but he was too late. Aylaen turned to stare at the boy in shock.<br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; She looked at Skylan. &#x201c;What does he mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just talking. He doesn&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; Skylan said, gripping Wulfe by the arm.<br>&#x201c;I do, too,&#x201d; said Wulfe defiantly. &#x201c;Treia poisoned him. I&#x2019;ll tell you how. She gave him a potion and told him it would help&#x2014;Ouch!&#x201d;<br>Wulfe glared at Skylan indignantly and rubbed his head. &#x201c;You hit me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because you tell tales,&#x201d; Skylan said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t pay any attention to him, Aylaen. He&#x2019;s crazy. He thinks he talks to dryads&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does he also think he can turn himself into a man-beast?&#x201d; Aylaen retorted. &#x201c;Because he can.&#x201d;<br>Skylan opened his mouth and closed it. There was no denying that. They had both been witness to the startling transformation. One moment a scrawny boy of about eleven years had been standing before them and the next moment he was a yellow-eyed, sharp-fanged wolf.<br>&#x201c;Tell me the truth about Keeper, Skylan,&#x201d; said Aylaen.<br>&#x201c;He died,&#x201d; said Skylan. &#x201c;He just died.&#x201d;<br>Aylaen shook her head and then she vanished. Wulfe vanished. The mast behind Skylan vanished. The dragonhead prow above him vanished. Fog, thick, gray, greasy smoke-tinged fog rolled down from the heavens and engulfed them in a blinding cloud.<br>Skylan could see nothing for the thick mist that floated before his eyes. He knew he was standing on the deck of his ship only because he could feel it solid beneath his feet. He couldn&#x2019;t see the deck, he couldn&#x2019;t see his feet. He had to hold his hand close to his face to see it. He was reminded of the terrifying journey he had made on the ghost ship, haunted by the draugr of his dead wife, Draya. He wondered if he was the only person on board the <i>Venjekar</i>; he had to swallow twice before he could force his voice to work.<br>&#x201c;Aylaen!&amp;#...</p><h2>Trip Trap</h2><p><p>On a rainy night in San Francisco, just before Thanksgiving in 1959, Jack Keroauc, Lew Welch, and Albert Saijo piled into Welch's car and set off on a cross-country trip, headed for New York City and then on to Keroauc's mother's home on Long Island.</p><p><i>Trip Trap</i> is a record of that journey, notes from the road by three of the central figures of the Beat Movement as they shared booze and coffee and peanut butter sandwiches, talking and singing and versifying while the country slipped by out the window. Here are the haiku that Keroauc, Saijo, and Welch jotted down in notebooks, along with a recollection of the trip written by Saijo in 1973, a section from Welch's unfinished novel that describes the trip and the return, and Welch's early 1960 letters to Keroauc that continue the bond forged during those days on the road together.</p><p>Jack Kerouac (1922-1969) was a principal actor in the Beat Generation, a companion of Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady in that great adventure. His books include <i>On the Road</i>, <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, <i>Mexico City Blues</i>, <i>Lonesome Traveler</i>,<i> Visions of Cody</i>,<i> Pomes All Sizes</i> (City Lights), <i>Scattered Poems</i> (City Lights), and <i>Scripture of the Golden Eternity</i> (City Lights).</p><p>Lew Welch (1926-1971?) was an American poet and active participant in the Beat generation literary movement. From 1965 to 1970, he taught a poetry workshop. His works, which were published by City Lights/Grey Fox, include <i>Trip Trap: Haiku on the Road</i>, <i>Selected Poems</i>, and <i>Ring of Bone</i>.</p><p>Albert Saijo (1929-2011) was a Japanese-American poet and active participant in the Beat Generation literary movement. He and his family were imprisoned, along with many other Japanese-American families, as part of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. During this time he wrote about his internment experience for his high school newspaper. After joining the US Army and studying at University of Southern California, he became friends with Jack Keroauc and other influential Beat Generation figures. His famous works include <i>The Backpacker</i> (1972) and <i>Outspeaks: A Rhapsody</i> (1997). A collection of his works from the 80s and 90s, <i>Woodrat Flat</i>, was published posthumously in 2014.</p><br></p><p></p><h2>Shroud for a Nightingale</h2><p>Hailed as &#x201c;mystery at its best&#x201d; by <i>The New York Times</i>,<i> Shroud for a Nightingale </i>is the fourth book in bestselling author P.D. James&#x2019;s Adam Dalgliesh mystery series.<br><br>The young women of Nightingale House are there to learn to nurse and comfort the suffering. But when one of the students plays patient in a demonstration of nursing skills, she is horribly, brutally killed. Another student dies equally mysteriously, and it is up to Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard to unmask a killer who has decided to prescribe murder as the cure for all ills.</p><p><b>P.D.

She spent thirty years in various departments of the British Civil Service, including the Police and Criminal Law Departments of Great Britain's Home Office.

She lives in London and Oxford.<b>Chapter One: Demonstration of Death</b><br><br>I<br><br>On the morning of the first murder Miss Muriel Beale, Inspector of Nurse Training Schools to the General Nursing Council, stirred into wakefulness soon after 6 o'clock and into a sluggish early morning awareness that it was Monday, 12th January, and the day of the John Carpendar Hospital inspection. Already she had half-registered the first familiar sounds of a new day: Angela's alarm silenced almost before she was conscious of hearing it; Angela herself padding and snuffling about the flat like a clumsy but benevolent animal; the agreeably anticipatory tinklings of early tea in preparation. She forced open her eyelids, resisting an insidious urge to wriggle down into the enveloping warmth of the bed and let her mind drift again into blessed unconsciousness. What on earth had prompted her to tell Matron Taylor that she would arrive shortly after 9 A.M. in time to join the third-year students' first teaching session of the day? It was ridiculously, unnecessarily early. The hospital was in Heatheringfield on the Sussex/Hampshire border, a drive of nearly fifty miles, some of which would have to be done before daybreak. And it was raining, as it had rained with dreary insistence for the past week. She could hear the faint hiss of car tyres on the Cromwell Road and an occasional spatter against the window-pane. Thank God she had taken the trouble to check the map of Heatheringfield to find out exactly where the hospital lay. A developing market town, particularly if it were unfamiliar, could be a time-wasting maze to the motorist in the snarl of commuter traffic on a wet Monday morning. She felt instinctively that it was going to be a difficult day and stretched out under the bedclothes as if bracing herself to meet it. Extending her cramped fingers, she half-relished the sharp momentary ache of her stretched joints. A touch of arthritis there. Well, it was to be expected. She was forty-nine after all. It was time she took life a little more gently. What on earth had led her to think she could get to Heatheringfield before half past nine?<br><br>The door opened, letting in a shaft of light from the passage. Miss Angela Burrows jerked back the curtains, surveyed the black January sky and the rain-spattered window and jerked them together again. "It's raining," she said with the gloomy relish of one who has prophesied rain and who cannot be held responsible for the ignoring of her warning. Miss Beale propped herself on her elbow, turned on the bedside lamp, and waited. In a few seconds her friend returned and set down the early morning tray. The tray cloth was of starched embroidered linen, the flowered cups were arranged with their handles aligned, the four biscuits on the matching plate were precisely placed, two of a kind, the teapot gave forth a delicate smell of freshly made Indian tea. The two women had a strong love of comfort and an addiction to tidiness and order. The standards which they had once enforced in the private ward of their teaching hospital were applied to their own comfort, so that life in the flat was not unlike that in an expensive and permissive nursing home.<br><br>Miss Beale had shared a flat with her friend since they had both left the same training school twenty-five years ago. Miss Angela Burrows was the Principal Tutor at a London teaching hospital. Miss Beale had thought her the paradigm of nurse tutors and, in all her inspections, subconsciously set her standard by her friend's frequent pronouncements on the principle of sound nurse teaching. Miss Burrows, for her part, wondered how the General Nursing Council would manage when the time came for Miss Beale to retire. The happiest marriages are sustained by such comforting illusions and Miss Beale's and Miss Burrow's very different, but essentially innocent, relationship was similarly founded. Except in this capacity for mutual but unstated admiration they were very different. Miss Burrows was sturdy, thick-set and formidable, hiding a vulnerable sensitivity under an air of blunt common sense. Miss Beale was small and birdlike, precise in speech and movement and threatened with an out-of-date gentility which sometimes brought her close to being thought ridiculous. Even their physiological habits were different. The heavy Miss Burrows awoke to instantaneous life at the first sound of her alarm, was positively energetic until teatime, then sank into sleepy lethargy as the evening advanced. Miss Beale daily opened her gummed eyelids with reluctance, had to force herself into early morning activity and became more brightly cheerful as the day wore on. They had managed to reconcile even this incompatibility. Miss Burrows was happy to brew the early morning tea and prepare breakfast and Miss Beale washed up after dinner and made the nightly cocoa.<br><br>Miss Burrows poured out both cups of tea, dropped two lumps of sugar in her friend's cup and took her own to the chair by the window. Early training forbade Miss Burrows to sit on the bed. She said: "You need to be off early. I'd better run your bath. When does it start?"<br><br>Miss Beale muttered feebly that she had told Matron that she would arrive as soon as possible after nine o'clock. The tea was blessedly sweet and reviving. The promise to start out so early was a mistake but she began to think that she might after all make it by 9:15.<br><br>"That's Mary Taylor, isn't it? She's got quite a reputation considering she's only a provincial matron. Extraordinary that she's never come to London. She didn't even apply for our job when Miss Montrose retired." Miss Beale muttered incomprehensibly which, since they had had this conversation before, her friend correctly interpreted as a protest that London wasn't everybody's choice and that people were too apt to assume that nothing remarkable ever came out of the provinces.<br><br>"There's that, of course," conceded her friend. "And the John Carpendar's in a very pleasant part of the world. I like that country on the Hampshire border. It's a pity you're not visiting it in summer. Still, it's not as if she's matron of a major teaching hospital. With her ability she easily could be; she might have become one of the Great Matrons." In their student days she and Miss Beale had suffered at the hands of one of the Great Matrons but they never ceased to lament the passing of that terrifying breed.<br><br>"By the way, you'd better start in good time. The road's up just before you strike the Guildford by-pass."<br><br>Miss Beale did not inquire how she knew that the road was up. It was the sort of thing Miss Burrows invariably did know. The hearty voice went on:<br><br>"I saw Hilda Rolfe, their Principal Tutor, in the Westminster Library this week. Extraordinary woman! Intelligent, of course, and reputedly a first-class teacher, but I imagine she terrified the students."<br><br>Miss Burrows frequently terrified her own students, not to mention most of her colleagues on the teaching staff, but would have been amazed to be told it. Miss Beale asked:<br><br>"Did she say anything about the inspection?"<br><br>"Just mentioned it. She was only returning a book and was in a hurry so we didn't talk long. Apparently they've got a bad attack of influenza in the school and half her staff are off with it."<br><br>Miss Beale thought it odd that the Principal Tutor should find time to visit London to return a library book if staffing problems were so difficult, but she didn't say so. Before breakfast Miss Beale reserved her energy for thought rather than speech. Miss Burrows came round the bed to pour out the second cups. She said:<br><br>"What with this weather and with half the training staff off sick, it looks as if you're in for a pretty dull day."<br><br>As the two friends were to tell each other for years to come, with that cosy predilection for re-stating the obvious which is one of the pleasures of long intimacy, she could hardly have been more wrong. Miss Beale, expecting nothing worse of the day than a tedious drive, an arduous inspection, and a possible tussle with those members of the Hospital Nurse Education Committee who took the trouble to attend, dragged her dressing-gown around her shoulders, stubbed her feet into her bedroom slippers and shuffled off into the bathroom. She had taken the first steps on her way to witness a murder.<br><br>II<br><br>Despite the rain, the drive was less difficult than Miss Beale had feared. She made good time and was in Heatheringfield just before 9 o'clock in time to meet the last surge of the morning rush to work. The wide Georgian High Street was blocked with vehicles. Women were driving their commuter husbands to the station or their children to school, vans were delivering goods, buses were discharging and loading their passengers. At the three sets of traffic lights the pedestrians streamed across the road, umbrellas slanted against the soft drizzle. The young had the spruce, over-uniformed look of the private-school child; the men were mostly bowler-hatted and carrying briefcases; the women were casually dressed with that nice compromise between town smartness and country informality, typical of their kind. Watching for the lights, the pedestrian crossings and the signpost to the hospital, Miss Beale had only a brief chance to notice the elegant eighteenth-century guildhall, the carefully preserved row of timber-fronted houses and the splendid crocketed spire of Holy Trinity church, but she gained an impression of a prosperous community which cared about preserving its architectural heritage even if the row of modern chain stores at the end of the High Street suggested that the caring might well have begun thirty years earlier.<br><br>But here at last was the signpost. The road to the John Carpendar Hospital led upward from the High Street between a broad avenue of trees. To the left was a high stone wall which bounded the hospital grounds.<br><br>Miss Beale had done her homework. Her briefcase, plump on the back seat of the car, contained a comprehensive note on the hospital's history as well as a copy of the last General Nursing Council Inspector's report and the comments of the Hospital Management Committee on how far it had been possible to implement the inspector's optimistic recommendations. As she knew from her researches, the hospital had a long history. It had been founded in 1791 by a wealthy merchant who had been born in the town, had left it in youthful penury to seek his fortune in London, and had returned there in his retirement to enjoy patronizing and impressing his neighbours. He could have purchased fame and ensured his salvation by succouring the widows and fatherless or by rebuilding the church. But the age of science and reason was succeeding the age of faith and it had become fashionable to endow a hospital for the sick poor. And so, with the almost obligatory meeting in a local coffee house, the John Carpendar Hospital was born. The original house, of some architectural interest, had long since been replaced, first by a solid Victorian monument to ostentatious piety and then by the more functional gracelessness of the twentieth century.<br><br>The hospital had always flourished. The local community was predominantly middle-class and prosperous, with a well-developed charitable sense and too few objects on which to indulge it. Just before the Second World War a well-equipped private patients' wing had been added. Both before and after the advent of the National Health Service it had attracted wealthy patients, and consequently eminent consultants, from London and further afield. Miss Beale reflected that it was all very well for Angela to talk about the prestige of a London teaching hospital, but the John Carpendar had its own reputation. A woman might well think there were worse jobs than being Matron of a developing district general hospital, well thought of by the community it served, agreeably placed and fortified by its own local traditions.<br><br>She was at the main gates now. There was a porter's lodge on the left, an ornate doll's house in tessellated brick, a relic of the Victorian hospital, and -- on the right -- the doctor's car park. Already a third of the marked plots were occupied by the Daimlers and the Rolls. It had stopped raining and the dawn had given way to the grey normality of a January day. The lights were full on in the hospital. It lay before her like a great ship at anchor, brightly lit, latent with activity and power. To the left stretched the low glass-fronted buildings of the new out-patient department. Already a thin stream of patients was making its dispirited way to the entrance.<br><br>Miss Beale drew up alongside the inquiry hatch of the lodge, wound down the car window, and announced herself. The porter, ponderous and uniformed in self-importance, deigned to come out to present himself.<br><br>"You'll be the General Nursing Council, Miss," he stated grandiloquently. "What a pity you decided to come in this gate. The Nurse Training School is in Nightingale House, only 100 yards or so from the Winchester Road entrance. <br><br>We always use the back entrance for Nightingale House."<br><br>He spoke with reproachful resignation, as if deploring a singular lack of judgement which would cost him dear in extra work.<br><br>"But presumably I can get to the school this way?"<br><br>Miss Beale had no stomach for a return to the confusion of the High Street or intention of circling the hospital grounds in search of an elusive back entrance.<br><br>"Well you can, Miss." The porter's tone implied that only the wilfully obstinate would try, and he settled himself against the car door as if to deliver confidential and complicated directions. They proved, however, remarkably simple. Nightingale House was in the hospital grounds at the rear of the new out-patient department.<br><br>"Just take this road to the left, Miss, and keep straight on past the mortuary till you get to the resident medical quarters. Then turn to the right. There's a signpost where the road forks. You can't miss it."<br><br>For once this notoriously unpropitious assertion seemed justified. The grounds of the hospital were extensive and well wooded, a mixture of formal garden, grass, and clumped unkempt trees which reminded Miss Beale of the grounds of an old mental hospital. It was rare to find a general hospital so well endowed with space. But the several roads were well signposted and only one led to the left of the new out-patient department. The mortuary was easily identified, a squat, ugly little building tactfully sited among the trees and made more sinister by its strategic isolation. The medical officers' residence was new and unmistakable. Miss Beale had time to indulge her usual, frequently quite unjustified, resentment that Hospital Management Committees were always more ready to rehouse their doctors than to provide adequate accommodation for the nurse training school, before noting the promised sign. A white painted board pointed to the right and read "Nightingale House, Nurse Training School."<br><br>She changed gear and turned carefully. The new road was narrow and winding, banked high on each side with sodden leaves so that there was barely room for the single car. Everywhere was dampness and desolation. The trees grew close to the path and knitted themselves above it, ribbing the dark tunnel with their strong black boughs. From time to time a gust of wind brought down a spatter of raindrops on the car roof or flattened a falling leaf against the windscreen. The grass verge was scarred with flower beds, regular and oblong as graves and spiked with stunted bushes. It was so dark under the trees that Miss Beale switched on her side lamps. The road shone before her like an oiled ribbon. She had left the car window down and could smell, even above the inevitable car smell of petrol and warm vinyl, a sweet fu...</p><h2>Superman Is Jewish?: How Comic Book Superheroes Came to Serve Truth, Justice, and the Jewish-American Way</h2><p><b>As brilliant as it is witty, Harry Brod&#x2019;s surprisingly insightful expos� delves into the secret identities of the world&#x2019;s most famous superheroes.</b><br><br><b>Many of us know that the </b>superheroes at the heart of the American comic book industry were created by Jews. But we&#x2019;d be surprised to learn how much these beloved characters were shaped by the cultural and religious traditions of their makers. <i>Superman Is Jewish? </i>follows the &#x201c;people of the book&#x201d; as they become the people of the comic book. Harry Brod reveals the links between Jews and superheroes in a penetrating investigation of iconic comic book figures. <br><br>With great wit and compelling arguments, Brod situates superheroes within the course of Jewish- American history: they are aliens in a foreign land, like Superman; figures plagued by guilt for not having saved their families, like Spider-Man; outsiders persecuted for being different, like the X-Men; nice, smart people afraid that nobody will like them when they&#x2019;re angry, like the Hulk. Brod blends humor with sharp observation as he considers the overt and discreet Jewish characteristics of these well-known figures and explores how their creators&#x2014;including Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby&#x2014; integrated their Jewish identities and their creativity. <br><br>Brod makes a strong case that these pioneering Jews created New World superheroes using models from Old World traditions. He demonstrates how contemporary characters were inspired by the golem, the mystically created artificial superhuman of Jewish lore. And before Superman was first drawn by Joe Shuster, there were those Jews flying through the air drawn by Marc Chagall. As poignant as it is fascinating, this lively guided tour travels from the Passover Haggadah&#x2019;s exciting action scenes of Moses&#x2019;s superpowers through the Yiddish humor of <i>Mad </i>to two Pulitzer Prizes awarded in one decade to Jewish comic book guys Art Spiegelman and Michael Chabon. <br><br><i>Superman Is Jewish? </i>explores the deeper story of how an immigrant group can use popular entertainment media to influence the larger culture and in the process see itself in new, more empowering ways. Not just for Jewish readers or comic book fans, <i>Superman Is Jewish? </i>is a story of America, and is as poignant as it is fascinating.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>***<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>A surprising question, one that takes a certain amount of chutzpah to even raise. To add even a bit more chutzpah, this book considers questions about the Jewishness of more superheroes than just Superman, and offers answers that will surprise many. You mean Spider-Man is Jewish too? Well, actually, yes, but in a very different way than Superman is. And, as we&#x2019;ll see, the shift between them reflects the evolution of Jewish life in America itself in the generation between the two, the generation that gets us from World War II and the &#x201c;Golden Age&#x201d; of comics to the 1960s and the &#x201c;Silver Age&#x201d; of comics. The historical turning points of those tumultuous years and others, like the powerful 1950s crusade against comics for supposedly causing juvenile delinquency, turn out to be central to our story because these events, and their great impact on American Jews, appear on comic book pages themselves, and behind the scenes in their production. For it turns out that the history of Jews and comic book superheroes, that very American invention, is the history of Jews and America, particularly the history of Jewish assimilation into the mainstream of American culture.</p><p><b>Harry Brod</b> is a professor of philosophy and humanities at the University of Northern Iowa. He has appeared on CNN, <i>Today</i>, <i>Geraldo</i>, and other TV and radio programs, and his articles have been published in many journals and popular magazines. He is the father of two children and still has his old comic book collection.<b>1</b><br> <br><b>SUPERMAN AS SUPERMENTSH</b><br> <br>How the Ultimate Alien Became the Iconic All-American<br> <br>Superman is one of the most well-known fictional figures in the world. We all know who he is. Or at least we think we do. In the timeless words of the 1950s TV series, he&#x2019;s &#x201c;a strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.&#x201d; But those who are used to the current scope of Superman&#x2019;s powers&#x2014;where he&#x2019;s capable of performing such feats as flying into a blazing sun, freezing a lake with his super breath or lifting mountains&#x2014;may be surprised to learn that in his original comic book incarnation his powers were much less expansive: &#x201c;He could hurdle skyscrapers, leap an eighth of a mile, raise tremendous weights, run faster than a streamline engine, and nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin.&#x201d;<br> <br>For those reading comics in 1938, Superman was much more than just a new super character. He inaugurated the entire genre of comic book superheroes. Prior to this, heroes of adventure comic strips or books had been detectives, cops, cowboys, pirates, magicians, soldiers, etc. No one had seen a costumed figure with superpowers before.<br> <br>At the time, &#x201c;comics&#x201d; meant the comic strips found in newspapers. Comic books, to the extent they existed at all, were mostly just reprints of the newspaper strips bound together. But all that changed when magazine distributor and publisher Jack Liebowitz was looking for a lead player for a different type of comic book that would feature stories that appeared first in this bound form.<br> <br>These new comic books were part of a new fusion of words and pictures that was in the air in the 1930s. &#x201c;Talking pictures&#x201d; (instead of silent films) had just appeared, with <i>The Jazz Singer</i> premiering in 1927. <i>Steamboat Willie,</i> Disney&#x2019;s first cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse, came out the next year, and was the first animated short film with a sound track that was entirely synchronized. <i>Life</i> magazine, with its new and distinctive brand of photojournalism, premiered in 1936, and was a great success&#x2014;appearing in <i>Life</i> became synonymous with having made it into the American cultural mainstream. Advertising was taking off, with ever more elaborate illustrations in magazines and roadside billboards.<br> <br>In that context, comic books are clearly the runt of the litter. The comics industry came out of the streets of Lower Manhattan, mostly from Jews and Italians who were one step away from the immigrant experience and two steps away from social respectability. Poor Jews from immigrant backgrounds ended up finding their way into this ragged end of publishing, what we might call rag, or <i>shmate,</i> publishing, since the Yiddish word <i>shmate</i> has the same dual meaning as the English word <i>rag,</i> meaning, literally, a throwaway piece of cloth and, by extension, a junky, throwaway publication. Businessmen like Liebowitz and Harry Donnenfeld, who came to be behind Superman&#x2019;s publication, also published girlie magazines and pulp fiction with names like <i>Spicy Detective Stories.</i> And more than a few of them had mob connections.<br> <br>As Al Jaffee, later of <i>Mad</i> magazine fame, put it, &#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t get into newspaper strips or advertising; ad agencies wouldn&#x2019;t hire a Jew. One of the reasons we Jews drifted into the comic-book business is that most of the comic-book publishers were Jewish. So there was no discrimination there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Comics historians offer other theories linking the predominance of Jews in the early comics industry to the Jewish attraction to communicative media more generally. Gerald Jones notes that of all the immigrant cultures of the period, the Jews were the most literate population. Trina Robbins attributes Jewish communicative skills to the need to be able to talk yourself out of getting beaten up. Journalist Jay Schwartz writes of the founding generation of comics creators: &#x201c;They came from homes where Yiddish was shouted across the dining room table, along with at least one other language. That&#x2014;plus English lessons outside the home and Hebrew to boot&#x2014;made for multilingual youngsters keen on the Sock! Zoom! Bam! power of language.&#x201d;<br> <br>These Jewish comic book creators forged a road into American culture in much the same way the Jewish immigrants who became the founding moguls of the American film industry did, with Lower Manhattan as their Hollywood. Motion pictures came out of cheap nickelodeon and peep show entertainments whose primary audience was single men, mostly working class, and largely immigrants. A good deal of the content was pretty lurid for its time&#x2014;not unlike the girlie magazines or the pulps. It was primarily the Jewish entrepreneurs who became the movie moguls&#x2014;men like Adolph Zukor, William Fox, Carl Laemmle, and Samuel Goldwyn&#x2014;who had a vision of the greater commercial possibilities if it could be transformed into more socially acceptable mass family entertainment. Likewise with the comics. Personally marginalized out of the mainstream by their foreign backgrounds, the publishers and artists created an alternate, idealized version of America, with larger-than-life idols soaring above the audiences below on the movie screen, on the comics page, and above all in their imaginations. Their strategy of assimilation by idealization worked. As audiences accepted the idealized images these Jews created, these new cultural icons became the vehicles through which these marginalized Jews were able to enter the cultural mainstream. Shut out of the centers of American culture, they created new cultural forms to bring America to them.<br><br>In this period of the birth of comic books, the team of Jerry Siegel as writer and Joe Shuster as artist had been working together on trying to create successful comic strips since they met at Glenville High School in Cleveland, a school with a large Jewish population, reflecting the surrounding neighborhood. Now twenty-three, they&#x2019;d had earlier success placing some strips, most notably one chronicling the adventures of their character Slam Bradley, who, as his name suggests, was a tough slugger of a detective, as well as others including <i>Federal Men, Henri Duval, Radio Squad, Spy,</i> and <i>Dr. Mystic: The Occult Detective</i>. The strip they were peddling now was just too different from what any newspaper was running to find any takers. But it turned out to be just the thing for this new idea of a comic book with new stories.<br> <br>Among their new hero&#x2019;s powers, the notion of being impervious to bullets had a powerful personal dimension for Jerry Siegel. Jerry&#x2019;s father, Mitchell (originally Mikhel Segalovich of Lithuania), had worked as a sign painter for a time, and encouraged his son&#x2019;s artistic interests. But eventually Mitchell had to give up his more artistic side for the more secure living of running a secondhand-clothing store. Mitchell Siegel died as a result of a nighttime robbery at his store, although stories vary as to whether his death was caused directly by the bullets that were fired or as a result of a heart attack brought on by the event. Whatever the actual facts, the story that many in the family were told and believed was that he was murdered and died from a gunshot wound. Siegel never spoke about it publicly, but the earliest version of Superman that we know about appeared shortly thereafter, illustrated with a drawing of Superman swooping in to stop an armed robbery.<br> <br>Joe Shuster&#x2019;s father, meanwhile, had arrived in Toronto from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where the family had had a cinema and hotel. In Toronto he found work as a movie theater projectionist. The family then moved to Cleveland when Joe was nine. Of the two, Jerry was the more outgoing and assertive, while Joe was more shy and retiring. Both were physically small, and uninterested in physically rough competitive sports. Joe was severely nearsighted, and tried to make up for being physically slight by getting into the bodybuilding fad that was popular at the time. They met while working on their school newspaper, <i>The Torch</i>. But the school paper wasn&#x2019;t enough for them, and they became active in the new world of the mimeographed and then mailed pages that came to be called the &#x201c;fanzines&#x201d; of the science-fiction pulp magazines. Through this they first met other science-fiction fans, some of them later becoming men who would play major roles in the early comics field.<br> <br>It was in one sense natural to find Jews making illustrated books. The biblical admonition against making graven images or idols had caused a lack of much of a real visual arts tradition among European Jews. In contrast to literature and music, the visual arts were relatively underdeveloped. One of the few outlets for Jewish visual artists was the illustrated book, which was deemed kosher in the culture of the people of the book. This art had thrived particularly in illustrating the Passover Haggadah, the book that guides the service at the celebratory, highly ritualized Passover meal. The Haggadah, what I&#x2019;ll call in this context the first &#x201c;graphic novel,&#x201d; tells a story in both words and pictures, so that those sitting at the table who are too young to read can follow along. The story is the tale of Moses, sent off in a small vessel by his parents to save him from the death and destruction facing his people. He is then raised among people to whom he really is an alien, but who do not suspect his secret identity, and he grows up to become a liberator and champion of the oppressed, with the aid of miraculous superpowers displayed in some truly memorable action scenes. Sound at all familiar?<br> <br>Who knows what lurked in the memories of young Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster when they created their tale of immigrant refugee baby Kal-El&#x2019;s arrival on Earth? Can it really be coincidental that Kal-El&#x2019;s original Kryptonian name spoken with a Hebrew pronunciation sounds like the Hebrew words for &#x201c;all is God&#x201d; or &#x201c;all for God&#x201d;? Is it just chance that he is sent from an old world, Krypton, that is about to explode, to a new one, Earth (which could readily be seen as standing for Europe, on the verge of self-destruction, and America, with its promise of new life, especially in those 1930s)? And is the name of his home planet really a secret invitation to decode Superman&#x2019;s encrypted secret identity as a crypto-Jew (Jews who, since the days of the Spanish Inquisition, have publicly given up their faith to escape persecution, but who remain Jews in their private lives and personal allegiance)?<br> <br>Traditional comics lore gives the major credit for Siegel and Shuster&#x2019;s finally securing publication for <i>Superman</i> to an ex-schoolteacher named Maxwell Charles Ginsberg, who changed his name to Gaines when he went into business as a salesman peddling cheap goods in various and sundry enterprises because Gaines sounded better than Ginsberg, meaning it sounded less Jewish. Among other things, Gaines became a comics packager and producer, obtaining material from writers and artists and selling it to publishers. He had Siegel and Shuster&#x2019;s submission of their <i>Superman</i> strip, but it was editor Sheldon (Shelly) Mayer, himself even younger than Siegel and Shuster, who saw its potential and selected it.<br> <br>The boys had mixed feelings when they received the offer. After multiple rejections, they were pleased that this work was finally being accepted. But they were disappointed that it was appearing in a mere comic book, not being placed with a syndicate for newspaper distribution, the holy grail for aspiring artists like themselves, because that was how you acquired both artistic recognition and financial reward. To fit the new format, Siegel and Shuster literally cut up the strips they had drawn for the newspapers and pasted their work into the page format of the new comic book. The comics page format was so new then that when the layout departed from the linear strip format to even a small degree, some artists inserted arrows leading from one panel to the next or even numbered the panels because they didn&#x2019;t think the reader would be able to follow the sequence. If you scan the sequence of those panels today you&#x2019;ll find they still embody the rhythm of a strip: four panels per day, with the fourth stopping at the best mini-cliffhanger they could muster. Then restart at that point the next day, count four, stop. The rhythm broke on Sundays, when there was more space. But then it was back to the same rhythm. Repeat until done.<br> <br>Siegel and Shuster worked frantically on a tight deadline, cutting and pasting their strips into a book. And so in June 1938 the cover of the first issue of <i>Action Comics</i> came to feature a man wearing a blue costume with a red and yellow emblem on his chest and a red cape flowing behind him, heaving a car over his head and smashing it into a hillside. Thus was the world introduced to the adventures of Superman.<br><br>But Superman was far more than this superpowered character. Once inside the comic book, the reader discovered another, less heroic character, Superman&#x2019;s alter ego, Clark Kent, a mild-mannered and timid reporter. And here is the question that brings us to the heart of our examination of these Jewish men and the comic book superheroes they created: Why? What in the logic of the story or, as we shall come to see, in the psyches of its creators, motivated the introduction of the Clark Kent role?<br> <br>In contrast to most of the other costumed superheroes who were to follow in Superman&#x2019;s wake, in the Superman saga it is the superman who is real, and the alter ego, Clark Kent, who is fictitious. Think for a moment of other familiar superheroes: Batman, for example, also has a secret identity, Bruce Wayne, who is a real person who existed long before the costumed Batman came into being. Likewise for Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Superman is the inverse of what would later become that standard model. Especially when one considers the nerdy nature of Clark Kent&#x2019;s personality, one has to ask, Why on Earth would Superman want to perpetrate this masquerade?<br> <br>The answer is that the psychology of Siegel and Shuster&#x2019;s imaginary world only worked if, at the same time that we the readers knew who Superman really was, we also knew that in the world of the story people saw him only as Clark&#x2014;a timid, socially inept, physically weak, clumsy, sexually ineffectual quasi intellectual who wore glasses and apparently owned only one blue suit. In other words, the classic Jewish <i>nebbish</i> (roughly: &#x201c;nerd&#x201d;). But little did they know! Jewish men had only to tear off their clothes and glasses to reveal the surging superman underneath, physique fully revealed by those skintight blue leotards, and flaunted by that billowing cape. Listen to Jerry Siegel describe his early inspirations:<br> <br>As a high school student, I thought that someday I might become a newspaper reporter and I had crushes on several attractive girls who either didn&#x2019;t know I existed or didn&#x2019;t care I existed. It occurred to me: What if I was real terrific? What if I had something special going for me, like jumping over buildings or throwing cars around or something like that? Then maybe they would notice me.<br> <br>But why does Superman want Lois Lane to fall in love with his false self, nebbish Clark, rather than with who he really is, a Superman? Renowned Jewish cartoonist Jules Feiffer had an answer. Feiffer writes that this is Superman&#x2019;s joke on the rest of us. Superman sees &#x201c;mortal men&#x201d; as the world sees Clark, which is essentially how the anti-Semitic world sees Jewish men. His wish for Lois to fall in love with Clark is then the revenge of the Jewish nerd for the world&#x2019;s anti-Semitism. I would add that it also reflects the same verdict on humanity found in Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>A Midsummer-Night&#x2019;s Dream,</i>...</p><h2>Complete Works of William Shakespeare</h2><p>This single-volume edition of the complete works of William Shakespeare includes commissioned introductions to each of the plays and poems by a team of academics, including John Jowett and Philip Hobsbaum, with a textual introduction by the Shakespearean scholar Alec Yearling explaining the significance of the Alexander edition.

To do so, they hired an intensely private, bohemian physicist who was also an ardent socialist. Patrick Blackett was a former navy officer and future winner of the Nobel Prize; he is little remembered today, but he and his fellow scientists did as much to win the war against Nazi Germany as almost anyone else. As director of the World War II antisubmarine effort, Blackett used little more than simple mathematics and probability theory&#x2014;and a steadfast belief in the utility of science&#x2014;to save the campaign against the U-boat. Employing these insights in unconventional ways, from the washing of mess hall dishes to the color of bomber wings, the Allies went on to win essential victories against Hitler&#x2019;s Germany.<br> <br> Here is the story of these civilian intellectuals who helped to change the nature of twentieth-century warfare. Throughout, Stephen Budiansky describes how scientists became intimately involved with what had once been the distinct province of military commanders&#x2014;convincing disbelieving military brass to trust the solutions suggested by their analysis. Budiansky shows that these men above all retained the belief that operational research, and a scientific mentality, could change the world. It&#x2019;s a belief that has come to fruition with the spread of their tenets to the business and military worlds, and it started in the Battle of the Atlantic, in an attempt to outfight the Germans, but most of all to outwit them.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p>Stephen Budiansky is a journalist and military historian. His previous books include&nbsp;<i>Air Power, Battle of Wits, The Bloody Shirt,</i>&nbsp;<i>Her Majesty's Spymaster,</i> and <i>Perilous Fight</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Preface<br><br> From 1941 to 1943, a small group of British and American scientists, almost entirely without military experience or knowledge, revolutionized the way wars are run and won.<br><br> Applying the basic tools of their trade&#x2014;a thoroughly scientific mind--set backed by little more than simple mathematics and probability theory&#x2014;they repeatedly demonstrated to disbelieving admirals and generals ways to double or triple the effectiveness of the faltering Allied campaign against the German U--boats. In the grim fight for control of the Atlantic during those years of uncertainty, the scientists&#x2019; unconventional insights achieved the near--miraculous in a battle crucial to the larger struggle to defeat Hitler&#x2019;s Germany.<br><br> The scientists who beat the U--boats never numbered more than a hundred in all, a fraction of the thousands who worked to achieve the two far better known triumphs of science in the war: the breaking of the German Enigma cipher and the making of the atomic bomb. Yet they were a collection of scientific talent the likes of which probably has never been seen before or since, certainly the oddest such collection ever assembled in one place: among them were physicists, chemists, botanists, physiologists, geneticists, insurance actuaries, economists, mathematicians, and astronomers. Six would win the Nobel Prize, in physics, chemistry, or medicine. Most were far to the left in their politics: some of the best were out-and-out Marxists, and more than a few had been committed pacifists who had come to see the defeat of the Nazis as a cause that overrode their abhorrence of war. Many were almost caricatures of the sort of unmilitary, awkward, overly intellectual civilians that military men routinely viewed with undisguised contempt.<br><br> That they were there when they were so desperately needed was the extraordinary result of a confluence of events and circumstances that I have set out to describe in the following pages: the onrush of devastating reality after decades of complacency toward the submarine menace, a political awakening of scientists brought about by the Great Depression and the rise of fascism, struggles within the militaries of Britain and the United States that pitted tradition against technical innovation and social change, and the appearance in the right place of a few unconventional political and military leaders who respected science&#x2014;-and of a few phenomenally accomplished scientists of great moral courage and unshakable intellectual integrity.<br><br> Patrick Blackett, a British physicist, ex&#x2013;naval officer, future Nobel winner, and ardent socialist, stood at the forefront of those scientists of penetrating insight and courage. It is no exaggeration to say that few men did more to win the war against Nazi Germany than Patrick Blackett. Certainly, few who did as much as he did have been so little remembered. Partly that is because he was a difficult, private, and inner--directed man whose political views and personality did not age well in the postwar world. Most people today&#x2014;-myself included&#x2014;-will find his uncritical admiration for Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union and his doctrinaire social Marxism painfully naive, at best. But it is worth remembering that that same na�vet� was the source of an idealism that we can only wish there was more of today: whatever else, Patrick Blackett was fired by a sense of justice, righteousness, and self--sacrificing courage that drove him&nbsp;to serve his country, and the cause of civilization itself, at the time of their utmost need.<br> <br>As director of the antisubmarine analysis effort for the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy during World War II, Blackett not only helped win that battle, and the war, but in so doing founded the new science of operational research; it has been an indispensable part of military training and planning ever since, a revolution in the application of science to the art of warfare.<br><br> It is far from clear that he or any of his colleagues from those perilous and heroic days of the scientific war against the U--boats would have the chance to make such an original contribution today. The bureaucratic machinery of war has become too vast and cumbersome to leave room for the gifted improvisation and iconoclastic thinking that Blackett and his colleagues brought to bear; today&#x2019;s routine incorporation of science in military affairs, which they themselves helped to bring about, has ironically sharpened the lines between military and civilian expertise; and science itself has become ever more narrow, specialized, and competitive, to the point that few scientists with the intensity to achieve discoveries worthy of a Nobel Prize have time left to think about much else.<br><br> Which is our loss, and which makes their story all the more worth telling.<br><br>Chapter 1<br><br> An Unconventional Weapon<br> <br>On the evening of november 19, 1918, eight days after the armistice that ended the war to end all wars, a train from London pulled into the depot at Parkeston Quay, just outside the East Anglia port town of Harwich, and a mob of reporters, photographers, and newsreel cameramen spilled out onto the platform. Harwich had seen its ups and downs as a small North Sea port. In the Middle Ages the town prospered shipping bales of wool to the continent and importing French wines. In the seventeenth century, its dockyards served as an important supply and refitting base for the Royal Navy during the Dutch Wars; Samuel Pepys, the secretary to the Board of the Admiralty and keeper of the vain and ingenuous diaries that remain the most revealing account of life in Restoration England, represented the town in Parliament; and Harwich&#x2019;s thriving private shipyards may, or may not, have built the merchant ship <i>Mayflower,</i> which carried the Pilgrim Fathers to America.<br> <br>A slow decline in the nineteenth century&#x2014;-the royal dockyards closed in 1829&#x2014;-was abruptly reversed in the 1880s when the Great Eastern Railway Company developed a large new port on reclaimed land a mile up the River Stour from the town center. The railway was rerouted to a new station from which passengers could transfer directly to ferries that took them on to Gothenburg, Hamburg, and the Hook of Holland; there were freight yards, a hotel, and rows of terraced housing for workers. With the coming of war in 1914 the Royal Navy requisitioned the entire port&#x2014;-quays, hotel, workshops, and all&#x2014;-and a force of destroyers and light cruisers and the 8th and 9th Submarine Flotillas moved in to guard the northern approaches to the English Channel.<br><br>And so Harwich, with its men who knew submarines and its facilities for handling them and its proximity to Germany&#x2019;s North Sea naval bases, was chosen as the place where an unprecedented event in the history of naval warfare was to take place on the morning of November 20, 1918. The terms of capitulation the German government had agreed to were extraordinary and humiliating, a measure of the desperation that the swift collapse of Germany&#x2019;s military situation had left her leaders facing. Fourteen articles of the Armistice dealt with the German navy. In addition to disarming all her warships and agreeing to have 10 battleships, 6 battle cruisers, 8 light cruisers, and 50 destroyers &#x201c;of the most modern type&#x201d; interned in neutral or Allied ports, Germany was to surrender outright &#x201c;all submarines at present in existence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with armament and equipment complete.&#x201d;&nbsp;Article 22 continued:<br>&nbsp;<br>"Those that cannot put to sea shall be deprived of armament and equipment and shall remain under the supervision of the Allies and the United States. Submarines ready to put to sea shall be prepared to leave German ports immediately on receipt of wireless order to sail to the port of surrender, the remainder to follow as early as possible. The conditions of this Article shall be completed within fourteen days of the signing of the Armistice."<br><br> Along with the horde of reporters, British submarine officers and men had been summoned from every port to be on hand to take charge of the enemy boats as they arrived. Accommodations at Parkeston, which included three moored depot ships, were packed far beyond capacity that evening of the 19th. The one &#x201c;lady reporter&#x201d; in the group was chivalrously offered the hotel billiard table as a bed for the night.<br> <br>A heavy fog shrouded the harbor the next morning as the destroyers <i>Melampus</i> and <i>Firedrake</i>, carrying the boarding parties and their attendant pack of press hounds, got under way at 7 a.m. heading for the point where the surrender was to take place; it was the southern end of the shipping channel known as the Sledway, about eight miles east--northeast of Harwich. A British airship droned out of the mist and passed to the north, quickly vanishing again in the fog. Then a few minutes before 10 a.m. a British light cruiser suddenly came into sight in the distance, then two German transports flanked by more British warships.<br> <br>And then there they were: a line of unmistakable, long thin hulls breaking the dark surface of the water, topped by domed conning towers, proceeding in straggling order. Two airships and three flying boats kept a continuous watch over the procession, passing and repassing low over the enemy boats as they came on slowly toward the rendezvous point. Lieutenant Stephen King--Hall, a British submarine torpedo officer, groped to find words to capture the incredulity he felt as he witnessed the scene from aboard the <i>Firedrake</i>: the dangerous and reclusive predator he and his comrades had hunted and feared and loathed, now meekly chivvied along like a few tame sheep. &#x201c;Try and imagine what you would feel like,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;if you were told to go to Piccadilly at 10 a.m. and see twenty man--eating tigers walk up from Hyde Park Corner and lie down in front of the Ritz to let you cut their tails off and put their leads on&#x2014;-and it was really so.&#x201d;<br> <br>A signal was given to the transports to anchor, and one by one the line of twenty U--boats joined them under the guns of the British destroyers. Motor launches came alongside the <i>Firedrake</i> and the <i>Melampus,</i> and the British boarding crews, two or three officers and fifteen men for each U--boat, scrambled aboard. Not sure what to expect, the officers all carried sidearms. &#x201c;We were prepared for any eventuality except that which actually took place,&#x201d; recalled King--Hall. &#x201c;We were not prepared to find the Huns behaving for once as gentlemen.&#x201d;<br> <br>King--Hall&#x2019;s boarding of <i>U--90</i> went by the book, with punctilious correctness. The German officers saluted; the salutes were duly returned; the German captain presented the signed terms of surrender&#x2014;-all equipment intact and in working order, all ballast tanks blown, torpedoes on board but disarmed, no booby traps&#x2014;-and the submarine&#x2019;s officers seemed almost pathetically eager to be helpful, offering explanations of the operation of the boat and its gear. The same scene was being repeated all along the line. &#x201c;My Hun,&#x201d; remarked one of the British officers back in Harwich that evening, &#x201c;might have been trying to sell me the boat, the blighter tried to be so obliging.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the submarines raised anchor the British crews ran up the white flag for the final transit into port. A strict order had been issued by the port commander that there would be no cheering or other demonstrations, and as the captured U--boats passed the ships in the harbor, crowded with spectators, they were greeted by silence. By 4 p.m. they were moored to buoys at the head of the harbor (at what &#x201c;the reporters now say we call &#x2018;U--boat Avenue,&#x2019; &#x201d; King--Hall sarcastically noted); a motor launch came alongside and the Germans, who had meanwhile changed into civilian garb that made them look more like peacetime caricatures of German tourists, green felt hat and all, than officers of a fierce and proud militarist state, were told to gather their belongings and get aboard. The launch took them to one of the British destroyers, which delivered them to the German transports for the trip back home, without ever having set foot on British soil.<br> <br>Over the next eleven days the scene was repeated in daily succession as ninety--four more U--boats surrendered at Harwich, all without incident. Some of the German sailors inquired pathetically of the boarding crews if they thought they might be able to find work as merchant seamen in China or Japan, if Germans were now unwelcome anywhere closer to home. Two refused to return to Germany and insisted on staying in England, where they hoped to find &#x201c;work and good food.&#x201d; Many of the surrendering boats were commanded by junior and plainly nervous young officers, their regular captains apparently having refused to make the humiliating voyage; others flew the red flag of the revolutionaries who had seized parts of the German fleet in the waning days of the war, their captains elected by the crews and holding commissions signed by the Sailors&#x2019; and Soldiers&#x2019; Committee; in other boats the crews sullenly refused to obey orders of their regular officers except when it was clear that the order would be backed up by the British officer on board. Most, especially the older men who were members of the naval reserve and had been merchant sailors before the war, seemed simply relieved that it was over, and bade farewell to their boats with dry eyes and no apparent regrets.<br> <br>In December 1918 the Allied Naval Commission discovered 62 additional seaworthy U--boats and another 149 still under construction at German bases and yards and ordered the immediate surrender of any that could sail or be towed and the destruction of the rest. The German government was warned that failure to turn over all of its U--boats intact would be answered by the Allies with the permanent occupation of its island naval base of Heligoland. The captured fleet, 176 boats in the end, was parceled out among the victors, most going to Britain and France, with token specimens awarded to the other Allies; Italy received 10, Japan 7, the United States 6, Belgium 2.<br> <br>One of the behemoths of the German U--boat fleet&#x2014;-the &#x201c;super--submarine&#x201d; <i>Deutschland</i>, originally constructed as a blockade-runner with a cargo capacity of 750 tons&#x2014;-was scheduled to be broken up. But at the urging of members of Parliament it was instead towed to the Thames in October 1919 and exhibited to raise money for the King&#x2019;s Fund for Sailors. &#x201c;Poetic justice,&#x201d; one member of Parliament declared with satisfaction.<br><br> But the real satisfaction to those who had battled this new undersea menace had come four months earlier, with the German signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919. Among its hundreds of detailed military stipulations, specifying everything from the maximum number of officers permitted in the headquarters of a cavalry division (15) to the number of rounds of ammunition that could be stocked per rifle or carbine (400), was Article 191, which declared: &#x201c;The construction or acquisition of any submarine, even for commercial purposes, shall be forbidden in Germany.&#x201d; In the course of the war Germany&#x2019;s submarines had sunk over 5,000 Allied merchant vessels, totaling 12 million tons of shipping. No one before the war had imagined that the submarine, barely more than an inventor&#x2019;s crackpot dream a few years earlier, would have been capable of bringing Gr...</p></p><h2>Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative</h2><p>This book proves that Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, as well as Eczema, can be alleviated, controlled and even healed in a natural way; that is, without the use of drugs, steroid creams, tar baths or even ultra-violet light. <p>The book views psoriasis, as well as eczema, as originating in the intestinal tract. Looked at from the inside out, rather than from the outside in, a whole new approach to the disease evolves. This concept identifies the problem as a build up of toxins (poisons) in the system which make their way out through the skin, but does not originate in the skin. Dr. Pagano defines psoriasis as the external manifestation of the body's attempt to throw off internal toxins. </p><p>Because of thin, porous, intestinal walls these toxic elements "seep" through the walls of the intestine (now referred to as "The Leaky Gut Syndrome"), causing a pollution of the lymphatic and blood circulatory system. </p><p>The body then attempts to rid itself of these toxins by expelling them through the sweat glands. Dr. Pagano further emphasizes that a proper DIET and adequate ELIMINATIONS are a major part of the solution. This book proves the efficacy of this theory by documented case histories, patient affidavits and striking before and after photographs.</p></p><p><b>Say goodbye to the pain, scales, itching, and self-consciousness&#x2014;-naturally</b><p>No more drugs, steroid creams, tar baths, or ultraviolet treatments!

A mission to cheer up the lonely, thin, increasingly despondent Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador, who had to move away from his house next door to Madeline's in Paris. In their efforts to cheer him up, and for a birthday surprise, Miss Clavel and the girls buy him a retired horse. All is fine until the horse gallops off at the sound of the trumpet to take his place at the head of the queen's Life Guards (his occupation before retiring). As readers whoosh through busy London scenes, we forget the horse has had nothing to eat all day. Upon his return to Pepito's home, he eats everything in sight: "The gardener dropped his garden hose. / There wasn't a daisy or a rose. / 'All my work and all my care / For nought! Oh, this is hard to bear.'" Meanwhile, as the horse is passed out from exhaustion and overeating, Pepito's mother says he has to go. And so Madeline and the others take the horse home with them to Paris, where "They brushed his teeth and gave him bread, / And covered him up / and put him to bed."

His construction business is failing, his family has grown into an overpopulated mini-dukedom beset with insurrection and rivalry, and he is done in with grief: due to the accidental death of a daughter and the stillbirth of a son, he has come to doubt the capacity of his own heart. Brady Udall, one of our finest American fiction writers, tells a tragicomic story of a deeply faithful man who, crippled by grief and the demands of work and family, becomes entangled in an affair that threatens to destroy his family&#x2019;s future. Like John Irving and Richard Yates, Udall creates characters that engage us to the fullest as they grapple with the nature of need, love, and belonging.<br><br> Beautifully written, keenly observed, and ultimately redemptive, <em>The Lonely Polygamist</em> is an unforgettable story of an American family&#x2015;with its inevitable dysfunctionality, heartbreak, and comedy&#x2015;pushed to its outer limits.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong>: <em>EmNephiHelamanNaomiJosephinePaulineNovellaParleyGale...</em> When times get tense--and they often do--for Golden Richards, the title patriarch of Brady Udall's <em>The Lonely Polygamist</em>, he turns to a soothing chant of the names, in order, of his 28 children. (It's also practical, when he needs to sort out just which toddler is showing him a scab, and which teen is asking if he can come to her 4-H demo.) While <em>Big Love</em> seeks the inherent soap opera in a man with many wives, Udall finds the slapstick: Golden's houses are the sort of places where the dog is often wearing underwear and a child or two likely isn't. But Udall doesn't settle just for jokes (though the jokes are excellent). Golden may be hapless, distracted, and deceitful, but he is large-hearted and so is his story. There's menace and more than a full share of tragedy there, as well as unabashed redemption and a particular sympathy for the loneliest members of this crowded family. With a fresh and faultless ear for American vernacular, Udall's big tale of beset manhood effortlessly earns its comparisons to tragicomic family classics from <em>The Corrections</em> to John Irving. <em>--Tom Nissley</em>Brady Udall is the author of New York Times bestseller The Lonely Polygamist, The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint, and Letting Loose the Hounds.

Unaccompanied except for native guides, she plunged boldly into forbidding jungles, often the first European&#x2014;and almost always the first white woman&#x2014;ever to arrive. Undaunted by tales of ferocious cannibals, she made friends with the tribes she met and collected priceless samples of flora and fauna. Along the way she fought off crocodiles with a paddle and hit a leopard over the head with a pot. When she fell into a trap lined with sharp sticks, she was saved by her voluminous crinolines&#x2014;for she always dressed like a lady. <i>Travels in West Africa&nbsp;</i>is a book as vivid and unforgettable as the extraordinary woman herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The charm of West Africa is a painful one: it gives you pleasure when you are out there, but when you are back here it gives you pain by calling you . . .

The plane bulged with young Marine Corps faces. Private First Class Richard Chan was the only one I knew very well. We had been together since Parris Island, the Marine Corps boot camp.<br><br>Chan had been born in Red China. His father and mother smuggled him out as an infant. He wasn&#x2019;t your average Marine. Besides being Chinese-American, he had his pre-med degree from the University of Tennessee with a minor in ministry. He could have been playing doctor in New York, but he joined the Corps because he felt that he owed the country a debt for taking him in. Corny as it might sound, he also wanted to be the best, a Marine, a feeling we all shared.<br><br>We couldn&#x2019;t get away from each other. Bunkies at Parris Island, bunkies at ITR (Infantry Training Regiment) School, bunkies at jungle warfare school in Camp Pendleton, California. Now we sat beside each other on a plane landing in Da Nang.<br><br>The blistering sun stung my eyes as I reached the first step of the drab gray departing ramp. I tried to be ready to duck. Scuttlebutt had it that one planeload of Marines had gotten hit on the runway, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear any gunshots, just some moronic sergeant screaming, &#x201c;Move it! Move it! Move it!&#x201d; By the time I reached the bottom of the ramp, my eyes adjusted enough to see a hot blue sky without a single cloud. A sleek, impressive camouflaged Phantom jet whined to a stop nearby. Thundering artillery echoed across the airstrip. The Marine in front of me whistled. &#x201c;Man! They mean business.&#x201d; God, I thought, this is the real thing. I&#x2019;m in a war. I mumbled a quick prayer, something I hadn&#x2019;t done since I was fourteen.<br><br>A skinny-looking helicopter floated down one hundred meters to our right. Its camouflaged body bristled with rockets and machine guns. The roar of another camouflaged Phantom streaking down a runway snatched my eyes as it sprang off the ground and climbed sharply above the steep green mountains surrounding Da Nang.<br><br>We double-timed over to a processing area. It was a couple of hundred yards away, but by the time we stopped, I was dripping wet. The pilot of the Braniff had said it was 119 degrees. I&#x2019;d thought he&#x2019;d been joking.<br><br>The Tet Offensive was in full swing, and the battle for Hue City had covered the front page of every newspaper back home. On TV the house-to-house fighting looked like World War II films.<br><br>Chan stood in front of me in the alphabetical line of Marines filing past a loud dispersing officer. Each man handed him a set of orders which he grabbed quickly and stamped with a big rubber stamp as he screamed, &#x201c;Fifth Marines!&#x201d; I tapped Chan on the shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s everybody going to the Fifth Marines? They can&#x2019;t need this many replacements.&#x201d;<br><br>Chan looked over his shoulder with one of those &#x201c;Boy have I got news for you&#x201d; looks. &#x201c;Oh, I think they might have accommodations for us. That&#x2019;s the regiment that&#x2019;s taking Hue City.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, buddy,&#x201d; I said with a hard slap on his back. &#x201c;I can always depend on you to find a bright spot in all this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Move it! Move it! Move it!&#x201d; shouted the sergeant.<br><br>A moment later the big rubber stamp came down on my orders like the authority of God. &#x201c;Fifth Marines!&#x201d;<br><br>We marched to a large dusty tent that was surrounded by a four-foot wall of sandbags. As a darkly tanned corporal called out names, each man stepped into the tent. Inside, a corporal with a huge black mustache handed me an M16 rifle, five magazines, and two bandoliers of ammunition. One of the men got a rifle with a bullet hole through the stock. When they gave the same guy a helmet with a bullet crease on the side, he nearly came unraveled.<br><br>Twenty minutes later we were herded into a waiting C-130 for a short flight north to a place called Phu Bai. The flight would have been more comfortable with seats or windows and without rifles sticking in my ear. One guy said we were flying over the South China Sea to avoid potshots. I wanted to be mentally ready for people shooting at me, but I could tell already there was a fine line between ready and panic.<br><br>Phu Bai was the base camp for the Fifth Marines. It didn&#x2019;t look like a dangerous place. One part even looked fairly civilized, with groups of tin-roofed houses made of wood and screen. Sandbag bunkers dotted the camp, and everything was colored beige over green from the dust of tanks, trucks, and jeeps rolling through the dirt streets. I soon found out that the civilized part of Phu Bai belonged to the Army. The Marine area was all tents. As usual, the Army was equipped far better than the Corps&#x2014;a constant source of irritation to Marines.<br><br>Phu Bai sat fifteen miles from Hue City. Just a quick truck ride north on Highway 1 would take me to Hue. Another little longer ride would take me to a place called Khe Sanh.<br><br>We were taken to a large tent where an old, crusty-looking master gunnery sergeant with a giant silver handle- bar mustache screamed, &#x201c;Attention!&#x201d; The chattering tent went silent.<br><br>&#x201c;I am Master Gunnery Sergeant O&#x2019;Connel. I will help you in your indoctrination on the Fifth Marine Regiment.&#x201d; The old sergeant gave his great mustache a slow proud twirl and turned to a large blackboard behind him. &#x201c;This is the most decorated regiment in the United States Marine Corps.&#x201d; He spoke as he wrote &#x201c;French Forteget&#x201d; at the top of the blackboard. &#x201c;Some of you may remember hearing about the Belleau Woods in boot camp. The Fifth took the woods in twenty-four hours of hand-to-hand combat. You will wear on your dress uniform the French Forteget. We are the only Marines in the Corps allowed to wear any item other than Marine Corps issue. The Fifth Marines have taken Guadalcanal; New Guinea; New Britain; Peleiu; Okinawa; Tientsin, China; Pusan; Inchon, in Seoul, Korea; and the Chosin Reservoir. Now it&#x2019;s Hue City.&#x201d; He put his hands on his hips, standing with his boots more than shoulder-width apart. He beamed with pride as he stuck out his barrel-shaped chest. &#x201c;We have the highest kill ratio in Vietnam. The colonel does not intend for that to change. Unless we are given permission to invade the North we shall continue fighting under the rules now in effect. You will not kill people who are not in uniform unless you are fired upon by them. You will kill anyone in a North Vietnamese Government . . .&#x201d;<br><br>As the indoctrination continued I became more confused. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if this guy was saying this crap because it was procedure or if we were really supposed to wait to be fired upon before returning fire.<br><br>Thoughts of all kinds scrambled through my mind like a blender. I felt scared and excited and lonely at the same instant, but mostly excited. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to write the first letter home and tell everyone all about it. I didn&#x2019;t know a bloody thing about it yet, but I knew I had to keep a few girls worried to make sure I got a lot of mail.<br><br>After the indoctrination, we were led to a small firing range where we got a chance to make sure our weapons worked, a small item I hadn&#x2019;t given a thought to.<br><br>A sunburned sergeant began shouting. &#x201c;The first ten in column spread out facing the targets at the ready position. Feet spread! Rifles at the ready! Move it! Count off!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nine!&#x201d; I shouted as my turn came to jog into a position facing ten large black-and-white bull&#x2019;s-eyes staked to the side of a fifty-foot-long by ten-foot-tall mound of dirt. The targets looked about one hundred meters away, just inside the barbed-wire perimeter surrounding Phu Bai.<br><br>&#x201c;Lock and load!&#x201d; I checked my magazine and flicked my rifle off safety.<br><br>&#x201c;Step two of the prone position! Drop to the knees holding rifle securely! Drop to your stomach breaking your fall with the butt of the rifle!&#x201d; I dropped to my stomach and took aim at the bull&#x2019;s-eye straight ahead.<br><br>&#x201c;Aim and fire!&#x201d; shouted the sergeant, and I did. Nothing! I squeezed the trigger again. My weapon sent out a harmless klick amidst the continuous firing from the other nine rifles. My stomach churned as I looked past the targets to the unfriendly mountains beyond.<br><br>The sergeant quickly found me a rifle that worked, but the broken firing pin left me with serious doubts. &#x201c;Check your boots,&#x201d; my stomach said.<br><br>Now that my confidence was thoroughly shaken we were led back to a row of large dusty tents. A voice shouted to get in a formation, so we did. A truckload of Marines drove by, covering us with a solid layer of dust. The men in the truck howled with laughter at us. Some shouted friendly insults about our stateside utilities. We stuck out like big green thumbs. Every person we&#x2019;d seen so far was dressed in jungle utilities. The men in the truck looked hard. Their jungle clothes were tattered and torn. The men hadn&#x2019;t shaved in a long time, their skin was dark from the jungle sun, and they looked lean and mean like Marines are supposed to look. We looked like fat, happy kids, clean-shaven, with side-walled haircuts and spit-shined stateside boots.<br><br>A small snappy corporal began shouting our names in alphabetical order. Once we were all accounted for, we filed into the first in the long row of tents. Once inside, a tough-looking supply sergeant shouted at me, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your size, Marine?&#x201d; Like everyone else, I received a flak jacket, cartridge belt, canteens, four grenades, one pack, jungle boots, and utilities. After that we were led to different tents according to the platoons and companies we had been assigned. Unbelievably, Chan and I were together again&#x2014;same company, same platoon.<br><br>Inside our tent were two rows of cots. At the end of one row, dwarfing the small cot he slept on, rested a...</p><h2>The Mystic Cookbook: The Secret Alchemy of Food</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provocative and insightful, this eclectic, inspiring, and beautiful book will open your eyes to the remarkable link between nourishment and spiritual awakening.

French Bulldogs and author of <i>The French Bulldog</i></p><h2>The River King</h2><p>A town divided by class lines is thrown into turmoil by a mysterious death, which begins to unravel the lives of a fifteen-year-old girl, a young boy, and a women running from her own destiny. By the author of Local Girls. 90,000 first printing.</p><p>There are two things any reader can count on when coming to Alice Hoffman: her prose and a remarkable empathy for those who live on the fringes of society. In her 13th novel, the author turns both to good account. Set in a tony private school located in a small New England town, <i>The River King</i> traces an intricate weave of intersecting lives over the course of a year. The Haddan School, founded in 1858, has long been the scene of tragedy and wonder: during its first year a tremendous storm flooded the grounds, and more than a century later "frogs can be found in the plumbing; linens and clothes stored in closets have a distinctly weedy odor, as if each article had been washed in river water and never thoroughly dried." Then there are the glorious roses planted by Annie Howe, a villager who married the headmaster and later hanged herself; these flowers have an unusual effect on sensitive girls. "When such girls walked past the brittle canes in the gardens behind St. Anne's, they felt something cold at the base of their spines, a bad case of pins and needles, as though someone were issuing a warning: be careful who you choose to love and who loves you in return."<p> A cogent warning indeed, for as in all of Hoffman's novels, the question of whom one chooses to love and who loves in return is the crux of the matter. <i>The River King</i> revolves around triangles. First there is Betsy Chase, a young photography teacher at the Haddan School who has gotten herself engaged--almost accidentally--to a fellow faculty member, even as she is inexorably drawn to Abel Grey, a town policeman. Then there are Carlin Leander, a scholarship student, and her best friend, Gus Pierce. While Carlin is able to fit in, even attracting the interest of the most popular boy on campus, Gus is a defiant outcast, a tall skinny kid in a long black overcoat "who viewed his own life as a prison sentence and experienced his existence much as a condemned man might." Carlin's romance with the charismatic, cruel Harry McKenna creates a rupture between her and Gus, and fuels a mean-spirited practical joke with horrific consequences. In the aftermath of tragedy, each character's heart, conscience, and courage is tested in unexpected ways.</p><p> Hoffman spins her web of love and heartbreak and transcendence with a sure hand, and in the process creates characters so palpably human in all their petty flaws and small instances of heroism that one almost expects them to step out of the book and into the room. Indeed, if there is a flaw in <i>The River King</i>, it is that Alice Hoffman doesn't always trust the magic inherent in her characters, relying a little too heavily at times on somewhat precious invocations of the otherworldly. But this is a minor defect in an otherwise satisfying novel, one that will keep the reader spellbound by its emotional complexity and compelling story. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Alice Hoffman is the author of fifteen novels: <b>Blue Diary</b> (2001), <b>The River King</b> (2000), <b>Local Girls</b> (1999), <b>Here On Earth</b> (1997), <b>Practical Magic</b> (1995), <b>Second Nature</b> (1994), <b>Turtle Moon</b> (1992), <b>Seventh Heaven</b> (1990), <b>At Risk</b> (1988), <b>Illumination Night </b>(1987), <b>Fortune&#x2019;s Daughter </b>(1985), <b>White Horses</b> (1982), <b>Angel Landing</b> (1980), <b>The Drowning Season</b> (1979), and <b>Property Of</b> (1977).

National Geographic&#x2019;s <i>Book of Peoples of the World</i> propels that important quest with concern, authority, and respect. Created by a team of experts, this hands-on resource offers thorough coverage of more than 200 ethnic groups some as obscure as the Kallawaya of the Peruvian Andes, numbering fewer than 1,000; others as widespread as the Bengalis of India, 172 million strong. We&#x2019;re swept along on a global tour of beliefs, traditions, and challenges, observing the remarkable diversity of human ways as well as the shared experiences. Spectacular photographs reveal how people define themselves and their worlds. Specially commissioned maps show how human beings have developed culture in response to environment. Thought-provoking text examines not only the societies and the regions that produced them, but also the notion of ethnicity itself its immense impact on history, the effects of immigration on cultural identity, and the threats facing many groups today. Threading through the story are the extraordinary findings of the National Geographic Society&#x2019;s Genographic Project a research initiative to catalog DNA from people around the world, decoding the great map of human migration embedded in our own genetic makeup.<br><br>At once a comprehensive reference, an appreciation of diversity, and a thoughtful look at our instinct to belong, this uplifting book explores what it means to be human and alive.</p><p>Wade Davis was named one of the Explorers for the Millennium by the National Geographic Society.

Dexter Gordon hanging out at Bop City. Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane all swinging through town for gigs. Sound like a nostalgic snapshot from the New York jazz scene, or perhaps New Orleans? Nope. This particular sentimental journey describes San Francisco's Fillmore District in its heyday. The Fillmore in the 1940s and 1950s was an eclectic, integrated, and hopping neighborhood dotted with restaurants, pool halls, theaters, and shops many minority-owned and boasting two dozen active nightclubs and music joints within its one square mile. Although it has been commemorated in songs, poems, and in Maya Angelou's <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i>, few people today know of the rich history of the Fillmore and its musical legacy because it vanished abruptly and so thoroughly due to redevelopment in the 1960s. Through dozens of archival photographs and oral accounts from the neighborhood residents and musicians who experienced it at its height, <i>Harlem of the West</i> celebrates this unique and rediscovered chapter in jazz history and the African-American experience on the West Coast.</p><p>Elizabeth Pepin is a photographer, public television producer, and former manager at the historic Fillmore Auditorium. She lives in San Francisco.<br><br>Lewis Watts is a photographer and professor of art at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with a long-standing interest in African-American history in the San Francisco Bay Area.Mellow memories emerge in this consummate, tightly edited look back at an exuberant way of life in San Francisco's Fillmore District during the 1940s and '50s, when dozens of blues, R&amp;B and jazz joints flourished amid businesses run by African-Americans, Japanese-Americans and Filipino-Americans. "The entire neighborhood was a giant multicultural party throbbing with excitement and music," remembers former Fillmore Auditorium manager Pepin. Art professor Watts and TV producer Pepin faced a difficult task when they set out to document the Fillmore's musical heyday. Few photos were known, and 1960s redevelopment left vacant lots. During a 15-year period, they explored city files and tracked former residents, and the resulting oral accounts by musicians and clubgoers make these pages an evocative echo of the past. Interviews led to photographic treasure troves, and although some pictures had "aged badly," Watts repaired damaged images with digital restorations. Researching newspapers, books and magazines, the authors stockpiled a mountain of memorabilia&#x2014;including a map of neighborhood landmarks, 200 b&amp;w archival photographs, ads, clippings, handbills and posters&#x2014;presented here in a 9 1/4 x 7 3/4" format. The enthusiasm of the era bubbles forth, and fold-out endpapers of long-ago logos and signs provide a nostalgic closing coda. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Reach her via: www.ginikoch.comIN ALL THE TIME man has been on our good planet Earth, we&#x2019;ve stared at and striven for the stars, at least in some way.<p>Or so they tell me. Frankly, my experience has been that what a goodly number are doing is staring at and striving for more wealth and power. And since aliens joined us on Earth, those same people have been striving even harder to control said aliens, presumably to use them to get even more wealth and power.</p><p>I&#x2019;m talking, of course, about the first time the aliens joined us for an extended stay, in the 1960s. Not the several times in the distant, ancient, and super-distant past, when a variety of aliens did flybys and, from what we can tell, evolutionary experiments here. No one was trying to control any of them. At least as far as we know.</p><p>Nope, I mean when the gang from Alpha Four in the Alpha Centaurion solar system came to live here permanently. Okay, not all of them came. Just some of them. Religious exiles, with some sympathizers and human spouses along for the ride.</p><p>They looked enough like us that they could hide and blend in. Well, mostly blend in: all of our A-Cs, as they call themselves, are drop-dead gorgeous. Maybe it&#x2019;s the double hearts. Having two hearts makes them all speedy and strong and quick to heal, so why shouldn&#x2019;t it make them total hotties, too?</p><p>Sorry, back to the more solemn recap. The A-Cs hid and blended in, known to exist only by a few Earth governments, and those with a high enough security clearance.</p><p>But, you know, the A-Cs had jobs. Math, science, medicine, killing parasitic superbeings. Mostly done in secret, because the A-Cs also have talents that allow them to alter what humans think they see&#x2014;in more ways than one&#x2014;but only for the safety and peace of mind of the humans not in the know. Well, most of the A-Cs were trying to keep the humans safe.</p><p>Some of them, of course, made a real love connection with other megalomaniacs, and really did their best to destroy humans and their own people seemingly indiscriminately, for whatever reason looked good on the daily menu at the Evil Super-Genius Bar and Grill.</p><p>And then I came on the scene.</p><p>In the three short years since I&#x2019;ve discovered that aliens, and lots of them, were living on Earth, a lot&#x2019;s happened. I fell in love with and married one of them, we had a child, and I inherited some mutated alien genetics. I also became a superbeing exterminator and the Head of Airborne for Centaurion Division. Then, somewhat against my will, I became the Co-Head Ambassador for American Centaurion. And then, truly against my will, I ended up the wife of a Congressman and American Centaurion&#x2019;s Head Ambassador.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Fortunately, I&#x2019;m adaptable.</p><p>Of course, along the way through all of this there were a couple of alien invasions that weren&#x2019;t as friendly as the one in the 1960s. One of them, we kept off the radar. One of them, however, changed the world. But through it all, the A-Cs were there, protecting Earth and everyone living on it. Well, you know, other than the ones who weren&#x2019;t. But there are a lot fewer evil A-Cs than good ones, especially since I&#x2019;ve gotten rid of a bunch of the bad ones over the past few years.</p><p>Yet there are still those who&#x2019;d rather make a buck doing terrible things to humans and aliens alike. Those who want money and power and all the perks that come with it, espe�cially perks that let them amass more money and power.</p><p>Now, before you start to worry, I&#x2019;m not anti-business. As Oingo Boingo likes to remind us, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with capitalism. Unless said capitalists are actually evil megalomaniacal scumbags intent on destroying everyone you care about and probably the Free World As We Know It. Then they need to be taken down, in the most extreme way.</p><p>But never fear, good citizens&#x2014;Megalomaniac Girl is here!</p><p>Huh, you know, after the last three years, you&#x2019;d think I&#x2019;d be hearing a lot more clapping and cheering and lot less of the sounds of silence broken only by the quiet sound of crickets chirping. So, let&#x2019;s try this again.

I was under oath. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you?&#x201d; The Senator in charge of the hearing leaned forward. &#x201c;Is that because you killed him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I didn&#x2019;t kill him.&#x201d; Christopher White had killed him. But he&#x2019;d had to.</p><p>&#x201c;What about Leventhal Reid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope, didn&#x2019;t kill him, either.&#x201d; My husband, Jeff, had killed Reid. To save my life.</p><p>&#x201c;LaRue Demorte Gaultier&#x2014;did you kill her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Esteban Cantu killed her.&#x201d; Accidentally, of course, but that one wasn&#x2019;t on me. &#x201c;Then he was arrested.

But lots of us have tried to kill him, and you should be grateful.&#x201d; James Reader had used the first guy we thought was Ronaldo for a body shield, Jeff had beaten up the real one, but he&#x2019;d escaped, and my bet was he&#x2019;d survived the beat-down he&#x2019;d gotten during Operation Destruction, too, and was out there somewhere, waiting to strike.</p><p>The Committee didn&#x2019;t seem impressed. I didn&#x2019;t look around, but the room was huge and it seemed filled to capacity with a blur of official-looking people in politically fashion-forward suits, all of whom were giving me the Frowny Face of Displeasure.</p><p>&#x201c;The entire former American Centaurion Diplomatic Corps?&#x201d; the Senator in charge went on. &#x201c;What about them? And Howard Taft? Antony Marling and Madeline Cartwright? Ronald Yates? And Beverly, that woman who had the most boring speaking voice in the world. Did you kill all of them and many others, including Gregory from Alpha Four, and Uma from Alpha Six, and the Mephistopheles in-control superbeing?&#x201d;</p><p>Now, these were not so easy to not lie under oath about.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sort of. Well, yes, really in the case of Beverly and a bunch of the others. I didn&#x2019;t do Gregory in, though.&#x201d; Tito Hernandez had done that. &#x201c;I took out Moira from Beta Twelve, though.&#x201d; Jeff had handled her mate, Kyrellis. Just barely, but he&#x2019;d managed it. &#x201c;They were all evil and trying to destroy everyone good and the Earth. By the way, how did you know Beverly was Miz Monotone?&#x201d;</p><p>The Committee looked at me derisively. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in your dream,&#x201d; the Senator in charge said. &#x201c;And we agree that whoever thought it was a good idea for you to be in such a public position was an idiot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can we sentence her yet?&#x201d; one of the other Committee members asked. &#x201c;Or at least ruin her husband&#x2019;s budding political career?&#x201d; The rest of the Committee nodded eagerly. They were all over the idea of disgracing Representative Martini.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I wake up now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want to?&#x201d; the Senator in charge asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Am I hanging out with The Congressional Grand Inquisition when I wake up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not as far as any of us know. Today. Tomorrow? Who knows?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the story of my life.

David Skal then suggests that he will seek to "explain why the images resonated in the culture ... [and] why so much of our imaginative life in the 20th century has been devoted to peeling back the masks and scabs of civilization, to finding, cultivating, and projecting nightmare images of the secret self." Whether or not you agree with his thesis that horror is a symptom of society's ills (war, disease, poverty), you will find much of value in this thorough, highly readable history--especially the detailed accounts of the work of filmmaker Tod Browning, and of how <i>Frankenstein</i> and <i>Dracula</i> made their way from books to plays to films.

The novel continues the story begun in Volume I but brings to light that the spiritual war is still being fought by the faithful as well as the wicked on the earth. As the righteous, personified by the Rogers family, gain strength and knowledge about how to be true servants of Christ, life long lessons are learned to prepare them for the final trials that they will have to endure.

Whether one reads the end notes or not, they will not be disappointed. There is excitement from the beginning to the end! A war is raging on the earth as it once did in heaven. An angel of light has fallen from glory and wishes now to steal the souls of men. Imam Mahdi is successfully gathering his legions as the righteous experience greater spiritual gifts to prepare them for the battle of the new age. For all, the heart is the battlefield and the choices dictate alliances. Which power will win your soul? It is the end of days and all is in commotion.</p><p>Wendie L.

Liebling shows to us in his unforgettable <i>New Yorker</i> articles, brought together here so that a new generation of readers might discover Liebling as if for the first time. <br><br>Born a hundred years ago, Abbott Joseph "Joe" Liebling was the first of the great<i> New Yorker</i> writers, a colorful and tireless figure who helped set the magazine's urbane style. Today, he is best known as a celebrant of the "sweet science" of boxing or as a "feeder" who ravishes the reader with his descriptions of food and wine. But as David Remnick, a Liebling devotee, suggests in his fond and insightful introduction, Liebling was a writer bounded only by his intelligence, taste, and ardor for life. Like his nemesis William Randolph Hearst, he changed the rules of modern journalism, banishing the distinctions between reporting and storytelling, between news and art. Whatever his role, Liebling is a most companionable figure, and to read the pieces in this grand and generous book is to be swept along on a thrilling adventure in a world of confidence men, rogues, press barons and political cronies, with an inimitable writer as one's guide. <br></p><p><b> A.

It's a long tradition, amply described. The literature begins with the decorous engagements in the letters of Benjamin Franklin and Abigail Adams and leads soon enough to the earthier liaisons in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Tropic of Cancer. Much is promised to the prospective traveler: if not a passage of enlightenment or erotic adventure, then at least a taste for boiled innards and string beans done right. As Mrs. Adams wrote home, pleasure is the "business of life" in Paris--there is another way to live, in other words--and this is the lasting gift, and illusion, that every visiting American bring home in his bags.<br><br>To this day, countless children of American privilege arrive in the Latin Quarter, bent double under their backpacks and concealing a money belt holding a Eurail pass and freshly squeezed carte orange. One of the pleasures of such an indolent, never-to-be-repeated existence is the liberty it provides the student on leave from academy-drafted reading lists and deadlines that frog-march undergraduates up and down "The Magic Mountain" in the time it took Hans Castorp to catch cold. In the late seventies, while on a sojourn of my own, I bought or borrowed my books at Shakespeare &amp; Company, the destination for English-speaking waywards on the rue de la B�cherie near Notre-Dame. One afternoon, while I was browsing the "used" section, a friend pulled down a paperback by A. J. Liebling for me. I'd heard of Liebling but never read him. He was a hero to some of the "new journalists" of the sixties and seventies, who put him in a nonfiction lineage that begins with Defoe. But Liebling had died fifteen years earlier, in 1963, and almost all of his books were out of print. Sitting on the floor, I started <i>The Sweet Science</i>, with its introductory flourish:<br><br><i>It is through Jack O'Brien, the </i>Arbiter Elegantiarum Philadelphiae<i>, that I trace my rapport with the historic past through the laying-on of hands. He hit me, for pedagogical example, and he had been hit by the great Bob Fitzsimmons, from whom he won the light-heavyweight title in 1906. Jack had a scar to show for it. Fitzsimmons had been hit by Corbett, Corbett by John L. Sullivan, he by Paddy Ryan, with the bare knuckles, and Ryan by Joe Goss, his predecessor, who as a young man had felt the fist of the great Jem Mace. It is great thrill to feel that all that separates you from the early Victorians is a series of punches on the nose. I wonder if Professor Toynbee is as intimately attuned to his sources. The Sweet Science is joined onto the past like a man's arm to his shoulder.</i><br><br>I read half the book right there and the rest that night. The Rubens canvases at the Louvre were checked off in my guidebook, but for me Liebling was now Baroque. His descriptions of the postwar boxing scene at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium, the Polo Grounds, the country training camps, and the midtown gyms constitute a self-enclosed comic universe, and, in the construction and the telling, his pieces are superior even to William Hazlitt's famous account of the "Gasman" Hickman-Bill Near bout in Hungerford, Berkshire, in 1821, and Liebling's own cherished model, Boxiana, the multivolume chronicles of the Regency-era fighters, by Pierce Egan. In a style of mock high diction undercut by the homeliness of the subject, of metaphorical flight and eccentric references--a style, in other words, that pays greater homage to the verbal dandyism of Egan (and Mencken and Runyon) than to the hard-boiled approach of the tabloids--Liebling made the art of bruising and its practitioners as vivid as any country fair in Dickens.<br><br>In <i>The Sweet Science</i>--in all his books--Liebling himself, the voice and the character, is immensely appealing: he is boundlessly curious, a listener, a boulevardier, a man of appetites and sympathy. He is erudite in an unsystematic, wised-up sort of way. His sentences are snaky and digressive, and thrive on the talk of the Times Square gyms and cigar stores. The boxing pieces are populated by the champions of his time--Ray Robinson, Joe Louis, Archie Moore, Rocky Marciano--but equally present are the artisans and satraps of the ring world, the sparring partners, the cut-and-bucket men and the professorial trainers, like Whitey Bimstein, who presided over Stillman's Gym, "the university of Eighth Avenue," as firmly as Robert Maynard Hutchins ran the University of Chicago. Bimstein was a prototypical Liebling cast member, New York to the bone. Asked about his experience outside the city, Bimstein allowed, "I like the country. It's a great spot."<br><br>Besotted with <i>The Sweet Science</i>, I went back to Shakespeare &amp; Company and took the only other Liebling on the shelf, a copy of <i>The Road Back to Paris</i>, his first volume of dispatches from France during the Second World War. Combat journalism is prone to some of the same sins as sportswriting--the self-dramatizing narrative voice, the bogus pronouncements. Only the clich�s, and stakes, are different. Liebling, it was obvious, was incapable of clich�, and, if anything, he protested too adamantly his limitation as an observer of the world beyond home. He claimed innocence of high politics and the scale of evil he was about to engage: "Hitler had seemed to me revolting but unimportant, like old G�mez, the dictator of Venezuela." The only way he was prepared to imagine the German enemy was through homey, ahistorical analogy. "I did not think about Germany," he wrote. "When I was a small child I had had a succession of German governesses all indistinguishably known to me as Fr�ulein. They had been servile to my parents and domineering to me, stupid, whining, loud, and forever trying to frighten me with stories of children who had been burned to a crisp or eaten by an ogre because they had disobeyed other Fr�uleins. . . . Anybody who had had a German governess could understand Poland."<br></p><h2>God Made Sunday: And Other Stories</h2><p>A collection of short stories from the everyday lives of people in the west of Ireland, evoking a world dominated by the incessant demands of working the land and the sea.</p><p></p><h2>A Very Cranky Bear</h2><p>Four animal friends cheer up a very cranky bear.

That extensive oral history forms the basis of this rich personal account, with additional material supplied by Richard. Rusk's public life began as an aide to General Joseph W. Stillwell in China and continued in the State Department under George Marshall and Dean Acheson. While the bulk of this book deals with Rusk's most visible period during the 1960s, there are also moving descriptions of his early life. Readers will find fresh insights into major events and personalities and will gain a much deeper understanding of this underrated man and his place in American diplomatic his tory.

Its creator, Mark Burnett, calls the show "<i>Gilligan's Island</i> meets <i>Lord of the Flies</i> meets <i>Ten Little Indians</i> meets <i>The Real World</i>," but you knew that. What's new about this book is the view from the other side of the lens. While the contestants gobbled wriggling three-inch beetles and savaged each other, Burnett and company were feverishly running the show and writing this tell-all account. It gives you a better feel than TV can for the natural setting: pristine beaches infested with skin-burrowing bugs that scarred "coquette" Colleen for life; Malaysian field rats attracted by the survivors' food and crawling over them all night; six-foot, yellow-and-black-banded sea kraits (snakes) devouring the rats; 300-pound pythons reeking of rotting meat, poised to drop from trees and eat people. <p> Except for the crew's hands-down favorite, U.S. Air Force survival trainer Gretchen ("She was wholesome, she was a survivalist, she looked great in a bathing suit"), most of the contestants were nice as pythons. Laid-back Gervase said, "Nothing's dumber than a woman, except maybe a cow," amusing "alpha male" Joel and enraging Jenna, Colleen, and Gretchen (IQ 142). Greg, who stank more than others because he slept in the jungle and got more bug bites, infuriated show host Jeff Probst. Despite "long nights cuddling with Colleen," Greg betrayed her to flirt with the aptly named winner, Rich. "It's like a kitten you find," Greg says of Colleen. "You give it a name, like Fluffy ... you're starving. So you look right in the kitten's eyes and break its neck. Nothing personal." The authors compare gay Rich and homophobe Rudy to the Odd Couple, and Dirk and Sean to "a pair of Malaysian field rats trying to stand up to a yellow-banded krait. The krait, of course was Susan."</p><p> The Pagong tribe was young, strong, lazy, and quarrelsome--"MTV's Beach House." The Tagi were older, but a far better team, and so more successful. And the most consistent, cynical, and adaptive contestant won.</p><p> <i>Survivor</i> is not just great gossip; it's the most fascinating and massively popular psychology experiment ever conducted. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>FINAL EVOLUTION<br> Staring into the Sun<br> DAY THIRTY-SEVEN<br> Full moon over the equator. <p>In the midst of their island experience, Maslow's hierarchy of needs crept up on the four remaining castaways yet again as they pondered life with a million dollars. The first stage, basic physiological needs, had been met a month before. Security and safety followed soon after, when the island's dangers become bearable. Love and feelings of belonging were closely followed by competence, prestige, and esteem. And while level six, curiosity and the need to understand might happen upon any of them at another point in life (or, in Rudy's case, had been accomplished decades before coming to the island and stayed with him throughout), the question of level five, self-fulfillment, gave a philosophical tinge to castaway life. </p><p>Simply, a million dollars was just three days away. They could see it, smell it, taste it. They dreamed of spending it. Would it change them? Would it complete them? Would it make them happy? Or had the previous five-weeks-and-a-day of existence been a futile pursuit? Castaway thoughts wandered to the philosophical and mildly spiritual. </p><p>Sooner or later, if Maslow is to be believed, an individual arrives at self-fulfillment. Peace. "A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is ultimately to be at peace with himself. What a man can be, he must be," Maslow wrote. The trick is finding that source of peace. </p><p>So where did the four castaways stand philosophically, three days before winning a million? At four predictably distant metaphysical compass points. </p><p>Sue Hawk festered with rage toward Kelly. On moral and ethical grounds, she wanted to rise above the rage and keep her early pact not to vote Kelly off. "I want to show that I'm a better person than she is. That I don't stab my friends in the back," Sue noted. Vulnerability and rage were becoming synonymous with Sue's character. She spoke frankly, had ceased being guarded in word or action, and, with every day closer to going home, was more aware than ever that acts of duplicity would be replayed on national television. She didn't want to be seen that way. "I've got a life after this," she said bluntly. "I've got to go back to work and look people in the eye and have them know my word is good. Plus, I feel lucky. I've been with Timmy fifteen years. We've got something really special. That's where my life is. When all this is done I'm going back home and know that I'm with someone I love. That's a great feeling, and money can't buy that. I've done some hard things on this show, like vote Gretchen off. But I've also done the right thing, as far as the game goes. Like when I voted Sonja off. She didn't belong here. The night before that, after she'd gotten soaked in the water, she woke up shivering like you wouldn't believe. I threw my body over her to keep her warm. So it may have looked heartless for me to vote off that nice old lady, but I was just trying to do the right thing. That's also why I brought up the alliances at the Tribal Council that one time. I was sick of people pretending they didn't exist. That's what I'm about. I may be blunt, but I'm honest. And I think that scares people like Kelly, who plays the game by lying to other people all the time, pretending to be their friend then stabbing them in the back." Rich and self-fulfillment weren't as easy to decipher. The fa Kelly, on the other hand, would use the million for independence, but until she broke away from her maternal issues, she would find that even money couldn't bring peace of mind. She would be a millionaire, but an unhappy one, still looking for ways to flaunt her independence and tweak the world. If she won the game she would be a beautiful and bland guest on David Letterman and the morning shows. Her picture would grace the cover of People. She would marry, have kids, work hard to maintain her cutting-edge mentality before giving in and buying a minivan and enjoying suburban life. In ten years she would be the subject of a "Where Are They Now?" photo essay, discussing how it was only several years after winning that she found something resembling happiness. Even then, she wouldn't call it happiness or self-fulfillment or inner peace, but something hip, like "coming to terms with what I'm all about." She was Las Vegas, a pleasant boomtown craving substance, but not quite sure where to find it. </p><p>Rudy was giving the money to his kids. He and his wife enjoyed a great marriage, loved snow skiing together, and knew a contentment in their life that a sudden influx of wealth or fame wouldn't change. He would continue going to SEAL reunions. He would continue cooking for his wife now and again, because even away from the island, Rudy found joy in preparing a fine dinner. </p><p>Regardless of the changes money would or would not make in their lives, one hard fact stared at the Final Four as they lay about the beach on Day Thirty-Seven, pondering what it would feel like to become a millionaire: For three of them, the end would be nasty, brutish, and short.</p></p><h2>Dogsteps, Illustrated Gait at a Glance</h2><p>Illustrated book using dog paw prints.</p><p></p><h2>Hardball: Are You Playing to Play or Playing to Win</h2><p>Great companies stumble and fall when they lose it. Highfliers crash when a competitor notices they don't have it. Start-ups shut down if they can't develop it. "It" is a strategy so powerful and an execution-driven mindset so relentless that companies use it to gain more than just competitive advantage--they achieve an industry dominance that is virtually unassailable and that competitors often try to explain away as unfair. In their "hardball manifesto," authors George Stalk and Rob Lachenauer of the leading strategy consulting firm The Boston Consulting Group show how hardball competitors can build or maintain an enviable competitive edge by pursuing one or more of the classic "hardball strategies": unleash massive and overwhelming force, exploit anomalies, devastate profit sanctuaries, raise competitors' costs, and break compromises.<br><br>Based on 25 years of experience advising and observing a range of companies, the authors argue that hardball competitors can gain extreme competitive advantage--neutralizing, marginalizing, or even destroying competitors--without violating their contracts with customers or employees and without breaking the rules. A clear-eyed paean to the timeless strategies that have driven the world's winning companies, Hardball Strategy redefines and reinterprets the meaning of competition for a new generation of business players.

In <i>Pre-suasion</i>, Cialdini builds on his investigations into the subtle world of influence to reveal that the best persuaders succeed not only because of what they say or how they say it, but because of what they do in the moment <i>before</i> they deliver their message. In the process he draws on a series of compelling case studies and a profound understanding of human psychology to offer a ground-breaking work that is both fascinating and brilliantly practical.</p><p>Robert&nbsp;Cialdini is recognized worldwide for his inspired field research on the psychology of influence.&nbsp;He is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author. His books, including <i>Influence</i>, have sold more than three million copies in thirty-three languages. Dr. Cialdini is Regents&#x2019; Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University and the president and CEO of Influence at Work, an international company that provides keynotes and influence training on how to use the lessons in Dr. Cialdini&#x2019;s books ethically and effectively.Pre-Suasion <br><br> PRE-SUASION: An Introduction<p></p> <br>As a kind of secret agent, I once infiltrated the training programs of a broad range of professions dedicated to getting us to say yes. For almost three years, I recorded the lessons taught to aspiring automobile salespeople, direct marketers, TV advertisers, frontline managers, charity fund-raisers, public relations specialists, and corporate recruiters. My intent was to find out which practices worked time after time. So I answered the organizations&#x2019; ads for trainees or otherwise arranged to be present in their classrooms, notebook in hand, ready to absorb the wisdom born of long-standing experience in the business of persuasion.<br> <br>In these programs, advanced trainees were often allowed to accompany and observe an old pro who was conducting business. I always jumped at those opportunities because I wanted to see if I could register not just what practitioners in general did to succeed but also what the best of them did. One such practice quickly surfaced that shook my assumptions. I&#x2019;d expected that the aces of their professions would spend more time than the inferior performers developing the specifics of their requests for change: the clarity, logic, and desirable features of them. That&#x2019;s not what I found.<br> PRE-SUASION<p></p> <br>The highest achievers spent more time crafting what they did and said before making a request. They set about their mission as skilled gardeners who know that even the finest seeds will not take root in stony soil or bear fullest fruit in poorly prepared ground. They spent much of their time toiling in the fields of influence thinking about and engaging in cultivation&#x2014;in ensuring that the situations they were facing had been pretreated and readied for growth. Of course, the best performers also considered and cared about what, specifically, they would be offering in those situations. But much more than their less effective colleagues, they didn&#x2019;t rely on the legitimate merits of an offer to get it accepted; they recognized that the psychological frame in which an appeal is first placed can carry equal or even greater weight.<br> <br>Besides, they were frequently in no position to tinker with the merits of what they had to offer; someone else in the organization had created the product, program, or plan they were recommending, often in fixed form. Their responsibility was to present it most productively. To accomplish that, they did something that gave them a singular kind of persuasive traction: before introducing their message, they arranged to make their audience sympathetic to it.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a critical insight in all this for those of us who want to learn to be more influential. The best persuaders become the best through pre-suasion&#x2014;the process of arranging for recipients to be receptive to a message before they encounter it. To persuade optimally, then, it&#x2019;s necessary to pre-suade optimally. But how?<br> <br>In part, the answer involves an essential but poorly appreciated tenet of all communication: what we present first changes the way people experience what we present to them next. Consider how a small procedural difference has improved the bottom line of the consulting business of a Toronto-based colleague of mine. For years, when bidding on a big project, it wasn&#x2019;t unusual to get price resistance from the client, who might propose a 10 percent or 15 percent reduction. That was frustrating, he says, because he never felt comfortable padding the budget to cover this kind of potential pushback on costs. If he did agree to the cut, his profit margin became so thin it barely paid to take the business. If he didn&#x2019;t acquiesce, he either lost the job or produced partners who were initially disgruntled because he wasn&#x2019;t willing to work with them on price.<br> <br>Then, during one proposal meeting, he accidentally hit upon a maneuver that rid him of the problem forever. It wasn&#x2019;t a step-by-step attempt to specify or justify each of the expenses involved in his services; he&#x2019;d long since given up on that approach, which only brought scrutiny to the bill. Instead, after his standard presentation and just before declaring his ($75,000) fee, he joked, &#x201c;As you can tell, I&#x2019;m not going to be able to charge you a million dollars for this.&#x201d; The client looked up from the written proposal he&#x2019;d been studying and said, &#x201c;Well, I can agree to that!&#x201d; The meeting proceeded without a single subsequent reference to compensation and ended with a signed contract. My colleague claims that this tactic of mentioning an admittedly unrealistic price tag for a job doesn&#x2019;t always win the business&#x2014;too many other factors are involved for that&#x2014;but it almost always eliminates challenges to the charges.<br> <br>Although he stumbled onto it, my friend is not alone in experiencing the remarkable effects of merely launching a large number into the air and, consequently, into the minds of others. Researchers have found that the amount of money people said they&#x2019;d be willing to spend on dinner went up when the restaurant was named Studio 97, as opposed to Studio 17; that the price individuals would pay for a box of Belgian chocolates grew after they&#x2019;d been asked to write down a pair of high (versus low) digits from their Social Security numbers; that participants in a study of work performance predicted their effort and output would be better when the study happened to be labeled experiment twenty-seven (versus experiment nine); and that observers&#x2019; estimates of an athlete&#x2019;s performance increased if he wore a high (versus low) number on his jersey.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s more, the potent impact of what goes first isn&#x2019;t limited to big initial numbers. Other researchers have shown that just after drawing a set of long lines on a sheet of paper, college students estimated the length of the Mississippi River as much greater than those who had just drawn a set of short lines. In fact, the impact of what goes first isn&#x2019;t limited to numerics at all: customers in a wine shop were more likely to purchase a German vintage if, before their choice, they&#x2019;d heard a German song playing on the shop&#x2019;s sound system; similarly, they were more likely to purchase a French vintage if they&#x2019;d heard a French song playing.2<br> <br>So it&#x2019;s not one particular experience that guides what&#x2019;s done later. It can be exposure to a number, the length of a line, or a piece of music; and, as we will see in later chapters, it can be a brief burst of attention to any of a variety of selected psychological concepts. But, because this book is mainly about the things that enhance persuasion, those chapters give special treatment to the concepts that most elevate the likelihood of assent. It&#x2019;s important here to take note of my choice of the word likelihood, which reflects an inescapable reality of operating in the realm of human behavior&#x2014;claims of certainties in that province are laughable. No persuasive practice is going to work for sure whenever it is applied. Yet there are approaches that can consistently heighten the probability of agreement. And that is enough. A meaningful increase in those odds is enough to gain a decisive advantage.<br> <br>In the home, it&#x2019;s enough to give us the means to get greater compliance with our wishes&#x2014;even from that most resistant of all audiences: our children. In business, it&#x2019;s enough to give organizations that implement these approaches the means to outpace their rivals&#x2014;even rivals with equally good cases to make. It&#x2019;s also enough to give those who know how to employ these approaches the means to become better, even best, performers within an organization.<br> <br>Take, for instance, one such best performer (we can call him Jim because, what the heck, that was his name) who worked for a firm whose training program I had entered to study. The company made expensive, heat-activated fire alarm systems for the home, and Jim was its top salesperson. He didn&#x2019;t win every sale, of course, but the likelihood that he would emerge from a sales call with a signed contract was, month after month, better than his counterparts&#x2019;. After an initial period of classroom instruction, I was assigned to spend the next several days accompanying various salespeople, to learn how they approached the selling process. This always involved an in-home visit to a family that had scheduled an appointment for a presentation.<br> <br>On account of his star status, I looked closely at Jim&#x2019;s technique. One practice stood out as central to his success. Before beginning his sales effort, he established an aura of trust with the family. Trust is one of those qualities that leads to compliance with requests, provided that it has been planted before the request is made. Despite the mountains of scientific reports and scores of books that have been written making that point and suggesting ways to achieve trust, Jim accomplished it in a fashion I&#x2019;ve not seen in any of them. He did it by pretending to be a bit of a screwup.<br> <br>The sales sequence taught to all company representatives was fairly standard to the industry. After making small talk to build rapport, the prospects (usually a couple) were given a timed ten-minute written test of fire safety knowledge designed to reveal how little they knew about the actual dangers of a home fire. Then, at the completion of the test, representatives began the active sales pitch by demonstrating the alarm system and walking prospects through a book of materials documenting the system&#x2019;s superiority to all others. Everyone else brought the book into the house from the start and kept it close by, ready for use. Not Jim, though. He would wait until a couple had begun taking the knowledge test, when he&#x2019;d slap his forehead and say, &#x201c;Oh, I forgot some really important information in my car, and I need to get it. I don&#x2019;t want to interrupt the test; so, would you mind if I let myself out and back into your home?&#x201d; The answer was always some form of &#x201c;Sure, go ahead.&#x201d; Oftentimes it required giving him a door key.<br> <br>I watched Jim make three presentations. Each time, his &#x201c;forgetfulness&#x201d; surfaced in the same way and at the same point. On the drive back to the office later that evening, I asked him about it. Twice, he wouldn&#x2019;t give me a straight answer, annoyed that I was pressing to discover his selling secret. But when I persisted, he blurted, &#x201c;Think, Bob: Who do you let walk in and out of your house on their own? Only somebody you trust, right? I want to be associated with trust in those families&#x2019; minds.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a brilliant trick&#x2014;not an entirely ethical one, but brilliant nonetheless&#x2014;because it embodied one of the central assertions of this book: the truly influential things we say and do first act to pre-suade our audience, which they accomplish by altering audience members&#x2019; associations with what we do or say next. In chapter 7, I will forward the argument that all mental activity arises as patterns of associations within a vast and intricate neural network, and that influence attempts will be successful only to the extent that the associations they trigger are favorable to change.<br> <br>Jim&#x2019;s tactic provides a good illustration. To become a top salesperson, he didn&#x2019;t have to modify the features of the alarm system he was selling or the logic, wording, or style of how he portrayed it; in fact, he didn&#x2019;t stray from the standard presentation at all. Instead, he only had to first become associated with the concept of trust, the (intensely positive) other associations of which would then become linked to him and his advice. Even Jim&#x2019;s unorthodox method of connecting himself to the concept of trust was purely associative. He didn&#x2019;t claim to be the sort of individual&#x2014;a close friend or family member, perhaps&#x2014;that people let have open access to their homes. He just arranged to be treated in way characteristic of trusted individuals of this sort. It&#x2019;s noteworthy that this tactic was the only real difference I registered between Jim&#x2019;s presentations and those of his significantly less successful coworkers. Such is the strength of mere association.<br> <br>All told, there are any of a number of first steps, besides establishing trust, persuaders can take that will make audiences more receptive to the case they intend to present. The steps can take multiple forms, and, accordingly, they&#x2019;ve been given multiple labels by behavioral scientists. They can be called frames or anchors or primes or mindsets or first impressions. We will encounter each of those types in the remainder of these pages, where, throughout, I&#x2019;m going to refer to them as openers&#x2014;because they open up things for influence in two ways. In the first, they simply initiate the process; they provide the starting points, the beginnings of persuasive appeals. But it is in their second function that they clear the way to persuasion, by removing existing barriers. In that role, they promote the openings of minds and&#x2014;for would-be persuaders like Jim&#x2014;of protectively locked doors.3<br> THE BIG SAME<p></p> <br>There&#x2019;s a joke I&#x2019;ve heard influence practitioners tell about the difficulties of persuading prospects to move in a desired direction. It tracks an exchange between the sales representative of a marketing firm and a potential client who wants to bring out a new brand of frozen spinach.<br> <br>Client: Do you have experience marketing new food products?<br> <br>Sales rep: We have quite a lot of experience there.<br> <br>Client: Does that include experience in selling frozen food?<br> <br>Sales rep: Yes, it does.<br> <br>Client: How about frozen vegetables?<br> <br>Sales rep: We&#x2019;ve brought several types to market over the years.<br> <br>Client: Spinach?<br> <br>Sales rep: Actually, yes, spinach too.<br> <br>Client [leaning forward now, voice straining in anticipation]: Whole leaf&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or chopped?<br> <br>At business conferences, the joke produces knowing, derisive laughter from the influence professionals who hear it. Of course it was never funny the times the joke was on them&#x2014;when they&#x2019;d lost a contract or sale because a prospective customer, caught up in some detail of a difference, missed the big picture of what they had to offer. The contemptuous reaction to the joke&#x2019;s punch line always struck me as odd, because I had found persuasion practitioners guilty of the same kind of narrowness&#x2014;not in meetings with a customer or client but in the training sessions designed to prepare them for those meetings.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t long after I began operating undercover in the training classes of influence practitioners that I encountered something curious: participants in the sessions were nearly always informed that persuasion had to be approached differently in their particular profession than in related professions. When it comes to swaying people, advertising works differently than marketing; marketing works differently than fund-raising; fund-raising works differently than public relations; public relations works differently than lobbying; lobbying works differently than recruitment. And so on.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s more, distinctions were stressed even within professions. Selling whole life insurance is different from selling term insurance; selling trucks is different from selling cars; selling by mail or online is different from selling in stores; selling products is different from selling services; selling to an individual is different from selling to a business; selling wholesale is different from selling retail.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not that the trainers were wrong in distinguishing their own bailiwick from those of their professional neighbors. But this steady referencing of their uniqueness led to a pair of lapses in judgment. First, they often detoured into distinctions of little consequence. Worse, in their emphasis on what&#x2019;s different among the successful persuasio...</p><h2>Kangaroo Dreaming: An Australian Wildlife Odyssey</h2><p>Recounts the author&#39;s nine-month journey through Australia in a station wagon with his wife, travelling from Melbourne to the Northern Territory, describing their experiences with wildlife and varying climate and terrain.</p><p>A few miles into the scorched, dusty interior of Australia along the Stuart Highway, naturalist Edward Kanze began counting carcasses. "Kangaroos stare blindly into headlights," he writes, "and the big rigs, drunk on momentum, smash them mile after bloody mile." Kanze, on what he compares at great length to Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, treks around Australia in a 1980 Toyota Corolla with his wife, packing along a library of natural-history books and a predilection for avian, reptilian, and mammalian mating habits. The author of <i>The World of John Burroughs</i>, as well as of a nature guide to New Zealand, he visits every state in Australia in six months, meeting with park rangers, herpetologists, professional birders, and grumpy crocodile-hunter-types on a quest to intimately know the continent's bizarre wildlife.<p> Kanze's list of finds is immense, with birds as diverse as orange-bellied parrots, the endangered glossy black cockatoo, crimson rosellas, and deadly Cassowaries, which Kanze describes as "an Emu with a stoop, dark, stocky, with a gaudy red necklace of exposed flesh," and that the Park Service warns has trampled several people. But Kanze's adventures are not limited to birdwatching; in fact, his true pursuit is finding the majority of Australia's 40 species of kangaroos. At first they appear in such scant numbers that he marvels at a single spotting. Soon enough though, the 'roos appear in such great abundance that he shifts his focus to the duck-billed platypus outside of Canberra, the mudskippers in the coastal rainforests near Brisbane, the pythons in Lake Barrine, and the "freshies" (freshwater crocodiles) at Edith Falls.</p><p> Going beyond the Attenborough-toned walk in the field, Kanze touches on the realities of the Aboriginal plight, the invasion of the European settler, and the desecration of the Australian landscape. He even pays a visit to an asbestos mining town where passers-through are warned not to breathe the particulate-thick air. By the time Kanze and his wife are plenty full of each other, their broken-down Corolla, and the search for the rufous-banded honeyeaters, the pied herons, the hairy-nosed wombats, the white-browed crakes, the pratinoles, the cane toads, the tree kangaroos, the giant lizards, and the flying marsupials, they have sated their list, and the reader, with Australia's remarkable and often-elusive wildlife. <i>--Lolly Merrell</i></p>ce of nine adventurous months, naturalists Edward and Debbie Kanze drove an old station wagon 25,000 miles around Australia, spending nearly all their time in wild places where wildlife abounds. <br><br>The Kanzes' odyssey began in Melbourne. Soon they were reeling from the cold, rocky mountains of Tasmania (home of the devil, who appears in these pages) via Ayers Rock and the central deserts to the steamy, crocodile-infested estuaries of the Northern Territory. The couple slept on the ground amid the world's most dangerous serpents. They endured the seductive bonhomie of lotos-eating Australians and hobnobbed with kangaroos, koalas, wombats, platypuses, giant monitor lizards, kookaburras, and more than 400 species of birds. They ran a gauntlet of epic hazards. All these adventures come alive in <b>Kangaroo Dreaming</b>, a humorous walk about through the flora, fauna, geography, and history of that surreal, over-the-rainbow place Australians call "Oz."<br><br>Never before h</p><h2>Everlasting Love: Connecting Rooms / Resurrection / Lake of Dreams / Role of a Lifetime / Tricks of Fate</h2><p>Five tales of romance and intrigue include the works of authors Jayne Ann Krentz, Linda Lael Miller, Linda Howard, Kasey Micheals, and Carla Neggers.

It just seemed a trifle out of character. On the other hand, the rose garden of the old Draycott place was no ordinary one. And Owen Sweet, Amy had decided, was no ordinary gardener. </p><p> "Are you, or are you not, a private investigator?" Amy demanded. </p><p> "Depends --" Owen Sweet answered. With the lethal precision of a fencer, he used a pair of garden shears on a clotted mass of evil-looking vines. </p><p> "What does it depend on?" </p><p> "On whether or not I feel like working at it." Owen took hold of the severed vines with heavily gloved hands. He ripped the old vegetation away from the window with a single, powerful motion. "I'm a little busy at the moment." </p><p> "Yes, I can see that." </p><p> Owen took no notice of her sarcasm. He seized another tangle of vines and dispatched them with ease. </p><p> Amy watched, morosely fascinated. She couldn't help it. She liked watching Owen Sweet. </p><p> The vegetation he was attacking with such diligence had grown so thickly over the windows of the old house that it had effectively blocked all sunlight from reaching some of the rooms. </p><p> Not that sunlight was a common commodity here on Misplaced Island, Amy thought. The forgotten little patch of land located off the coast of Washington sat squarely in the middle of a rain shadow. A perpetual mist shrouded the island on good days. Dense rain poured down the rest of the time. </p><p> The local joke was that the island had earned its name when its original discoverer had temporarily misplaced it in the fog. Whatever the truth of that story, there was no doubt but that one had to be determined to find Misplaced Island. </p><p> And, Amy thought, one had to have either a powerful motivation or an extremely odd sense of whimsy to make one's home here. She wondered which of those two possibilities applied to Owen Sweet. </p><p> "Owen, this garden went wild years ago, just like the house." Amy was growing increasingly exasperated. Time was running out, and she needed Owen Sweet. "It can wait a few more days before you tame it." </p><p> Owen paused briefly to look at her. His sea-green eyes gleamed in the misty gray light. "I'm in the mood to do it now." </p><p> <i>Sweet</i> was definitely a misnomer, Amy reflected, not for the first time. As far as she had been able to discern, Owen was anything but sweet, in either nature or temperament. She suspected he was yet another result of a baby having been switched at birth. Happened all the time, they said. Amy wondered what Sweet's parents had thought when they discovered that they had been given a little green-eyed, black-haired demon to raise. </p><p> He was proving to be stubborn and thoroughly irritating, but there was something about the man that fascinated Amy. She did not know him very well, even though she had sold him the Draycott place. No one on the island really knew Owen Sweet. </p><p> He had moved to Misplaced Island two months ago. Amy had met him when he walked into the real estate office she operated out of the parlor of her cliffside cottage. She had been stunned by her reaction to him. Hunger and longing and a singing sense of joyous discovery barely began to describe it. </p><p> She had tried to squelch the feelings. True, she was a struggling romance novelist on the side, but Amy was far too pragmatic to believe in love at first sight. On the other hand, she trusted her own instincts when it came to people. They had stood her in good stead in the real estate business, and she saw no reason to discount them when dealing with members of the opposite sex. One thing was for certain. Those instincts had never reacted with such overwhelming intensity to any of the handful of men she had dated. </p><p> Owen had appeared oblivious of her carefully concealed response to him. He had announced without preamble that he'd already toured the island on his own and had checked out the available properties. He had decided to buy the Draycott place. </p><p> Amy had been horrified. Everyone on the island knew that the old Draycott house, a Victorian monstrosity, was a disaster from foundation to roof. She had dutifully done her best to steer Owen toward other real estate opportunities, but he had refused to listen to her advice. In the end a sale was a sale. Amy had reluctantly written up the deal. </p><p> The only good part about the transaction, she had told herself, was that Misplaced Island was a very small community. She would see Owen Sweet again. She could only hope it wouldn't be in the course of a lawsuit over the Draycott sale. Some buyers tended to blame the real estate agent when they discovered they had made a bad bargain. </p><p> But Owen had appeared to be content with his new home when, to her secret delight, Amy had begun to encounter him with increasing regularity at the post office, in the checkout line at the island's only grocery store, and at the tiny bookshop. One of the few facts that she had gleaned concerning him was that he was a voracious reader. At the rate he ordered books from Mrs. Akers, the owner of the bookshop, he would single-handedly keep her small store in the black during the coming winter. </p><p> But last week had been the real turning point. After running into her at the post office, Owen had invited Amy to join him in a cup of coffee at the town's one and only cafe. The conversation had concerned such riveting matters as the weather, the latest novels they had each read, and the limited ferry schedule. Amy had walked on air all the way back to her cottage. Hope had bloomed within her. </p><p> She stifled a small, wistful sigh as she watched Owen free another window from its shroud of clinging vines. There was a lean, supple strength about him that captivated her senses. While it was true that, objectively speaking, Owen's grim features could have been created by someone who would have been equally adept at designing junkyard dogs, Amy found him strangely compelling. Which probably said far too much about the limited social life on Misplaced Island, she told herself. </p><p> Then again, she had not even been aware of a lack of a social life until Owen had arrived. </p><p> She watched him now with brooding determination. This was the first time she had paid a call on Owen Sweet since he had moved into his crumbling abode. She had come on business, not for social masons. She needed this man. She needed him badly. </p><p> It wasn't as if she had a lot of choice. The small sign on the front door of the old Victorian ruin Owen called home said it all. It read SWEET INVESTIGATIONS. </p><p> Owen Sweet was the only private investigator on Misplaced Island. There was not a lot of call for his type of work in the small community. Amy was quite certain that since his arrival he had yet to get a single case. She had naively believed that he would be thrilled to have work. Obviously, she had been mistaken. </p><p> Amy braced one hand against the garden's stone wall and drummed her fingers with simmering impatience. Unaware or uncaring of her irritation, Owen Sweet went about his work among the grotesquely tangled rosebushes which clogged the garden. </p><p> The roses had been abandoned along with the crumbling ruin of a house years ago. Instead of dying off in a bittersweet, genteel manner, they had gone wild, with a vengeance. They climbed the garden walls as though bent on escaping a prison. They formed impenetrable thickets across the cracked paths, choked the empty fishpond, and had apparently been intent on marching up the steps and into the sunporch. Owen Sweet had arrived in the nick of time. </p><p> "Can I take it from your attitude that you are not interested in working for me?" Amy asked bluntly. </p><p> "Yeah." Sleek muscles moved easily beneath Owen's black T-shirt as he shifted an armload of defeated vines to a growing pile in the center of the garden. "You can draw that conclusion." </p><p> "Very well then, you leave me no choice." Amy removed her hand from the stone wall and straightened in resignation. "I shall have to find someone else." </p><p> Owen's mouth curved slightly. "Good luck. The last time I looked in the phone book, I was the only PI on the island." </p><p> Amy brushed her hands together and started toward the sagging gate. "I had hoped to give my business to someone local because I believe in supporting the local economy. But since you're not interested, I'm sure I can find someone in Seattle who will be happy to take my money." </p><p> "Seattle?" </p><p> Amy was aware that Owen had gone very still behind her. She did not turn around. "If I hurry, I can catch the afternoon ferry." </p><p> "Damn. Hold on just a minute." </p><p> Satisfaction surged through Amy. She had been in real estate long enough to sense when a buyer had undergone a quick change of heart. She paused at the gate to smile at Owen with polite inquiry. </p><p> "Was there something you wanted, Owen?" </p><p> He scowled ferociously, an expression which did nothing to soften his harsh face. "Yeah. Some answers." </p><p> "Sorry, I don't have time to chat. The ferry leaves in a couple of hours and I haven't finished packing." </p><p> "Let's get real here." Owen stripped off his gloves as he strode toward her along the garden walk. "What does a woman like you need with a private investigator?" </p><p> "'A woman like me'?" </p><p> "No offense, Amy, but you're hardly the type to have the sort of problems that require the services of someone in my line of work." </p><p> "What would you know about my problems?" </p><p> Owen came to a halt in front of her and planted his fists on his hips. "You're not exactly a mystery woman. You've been living on Misplaced Island for nearly a year. During that time you've opened a real estate agency and published a romance novel. Before you came here, you worked the condominium market in Seattle. You aren't exactly rich, but you did all right in your own real estate investments." </p><p> Amy was taken back. "Good grief. How did you -- " </p><p> "Everyone on the island seems very fond of you," Owen continued ruthlessly. "I seriously doubt that you have any enemies around these parts. You are thirty years old and have never been married. You do not flirt with married men, so the local women have no reason to dislike you. You are not dating anyone at present, so you have no reason to employ an investigator to tail an errant boyfriend." </p><p> Amy gazed at him with mingled anger and amazement. "Are you quite finished?" </p><p> "No, not quite. You appear to live like a cloistered nun, Ms. Comfort. Therefore, I find it difficult to believe that you have got yourself into a situation which requires an investigator. </p><p> "You seem to have done a fairly thorough job investigating me. May I ask why?" </p><p> Owen wiped his sweat-dampened forehead with the back of one muscular bare arm. "That should be sort of obvious." </p><p> "Well, it's not obvious to me." </p><p> He gripped the top of the drooping gate and contemplated her with narrowed eyes. "No, I can see that." </p><p> "I don't know what this is all about, nor do I have the time to find out. If you're not going to accept my case, I've got to find someone else. Please excuse me." </p><p> Amy tried to open the gate. Owen took no notice of her effort. Instead, he leaned heavily back against it and folded his arms across his chest. He looked annoyed but resigned. </p><p> "Okay, tell me about it," he said. </p><p> "Tell you about what?" </p><p> "This problem of yours. The one that requires an investigator." </p><p> Amy fixed him with a frosty glare. "It's a confidential matter. I see no reason to discuss it with someone who is not going to be working for me." </p><p> "Hell, I'll take the case. Now tell me what's got you in such an uproar." </p><p> "I don't think that I care for your unprofessional manner." </p><p> "Sorry, it's the only manner I've got." He considered her thoughtfully for a few seconds. Then he came away from the gate and took her arm. "Come on, let's go inside. I'll make you a cup of coffee and you can tell me all your problems." </p><p> "I'm no longer sure that I want you handling my case." </p><p> "Don't be silly. A few minutes ago you were practically begging me to take your precious case." </p><p> "I was not begging you. And furthermore, I've changed my mind." </p><p> "So have I." </p><p> Amy thought about digging in her heels, but her options were extremely limited. It would take time to hunt up an investigator in Seattle. And money. She did not possess unlimited quantities of either. She allowed Owen to lead her up the steps. </p><p> The interior of the house was as run-down and abandoned-looking as the garden, but at least nothing appeared to be actually growing on the walls or springing up through the floorboards. </p><p> Threadbare velvet curtains that had faded to a peculiar shade of maroon flanked the grimy windows. An atmosphere of gloom and decay hovered over the front parlor. Several pieces of heavy, claw-footed furniture clustered near the black-marble fireplace. There was very little paint left on the walls and the wooden floors were raw and scarred. </p><p> A pang of guilt went through Amy, temporarily erasing her irritation. "I did try to warn you that this was a fixer-upper." </p><p> "A fixer-upper?" Owen gave her a derisive look. "It's a life sentence. Wiring's shot. Plumbing's rusted out. Roof needs repair. I'll have to replace the furnace before winter sets in, along with all the appliances." </p><p> "Don't you dare blame me. I made you read every single word on the seller's disclosure statement. You knew what you were getting into when you bought this place." </p><p> "Did I? That's debatable." But Owen appeared perversely satisfied with his purchase. "Have a seat." Not ungently, he pushed her toward a high-backed, velvet-covered sofa. I'll get the coffee." </p><p> Amy sat down gingerly and surveyed the shabby interior of the parlor. She shook her head in amazement. It was true that she had sold him the house, but she had no idea what he was doing here in it. Why had he come here to Misplaced Island, she wondered. </p><p> Owen reappeared a few minutes later carrying a tray laden with a French press coffeepot and two cups. He set his burden down on the battered old coffee table. </p><p> "All right, tell me what this is all about." He sank into the depths of one of the massive wingback chairs. </p><p> "It's a very straightforward case," Amy said crisply. "My aunt, Bernice Comfort, has recently announced her engagement. I want you to, investigate her fianc�, Arthur Crabshaw." </p><p> Owen looked up as he poured coffee. "Why?" </p><p> "Because there's something about Crabshaw that I don't quite trust. I met him a couple of weeks ago, and I have the distinct feeling that he's hiding something. He appeared out of nowhere a few months after her husband, Uncle Morty, died, and immediately swept Aunt Bernice off her feet." </p><p> "You write romance novels, don't you? I would have thought you'd have approved of Crabshaw's technique." </p><p> "If you're not going to take this case seriously, please tell me now so that I can find another investigator." </p><p> "I'm serious. You have no idea just how serious." </p><p> She glowered at him. "What's that supposed to mean?" </p>...</p><h2>THE COMPLETE CANCER CLEANSE: A Proven Program to Detoxify and Renew Body, Mind, and Spirit</h2><p>This book guides readers through a process of detoxification and renewal so they can partner with their physician to overcome cancer.

Infinite Possibilities.</h2><p><br>What if you could have sex with anyone in the world?<br><br>The ultimate fantasy? Or a nightmare of self-discovery? Michael Blasco, a young scientist investigating what happens to the brain during the process of learning, suddenly finds himself on the other end of experimentation. On the way home from his lab one night he runs into Tony, a fitness instructor from his gym who he harbors a crush for, on the same platform waiting for the subway. When Michael imagines Tony naked, a pleasant fantasy to spice up a dull journey home, an extraordinary thing happens: Tony strips then and there on the platform and offers himself to Michael in front of all onlookers. Horrified, Michael flees. But back at his apartment, Tony reappears, as if by magic. And disappears again, when Michael wishes him away. Being a scientist, Michael recognizes an experiment when he sees one, and sets out to test the parameters of his newfound gift. In quick succession he conjures up Billie Holliday, Johnny Weismuller, Daffy Duck, Picasso, Sophia Loren, even his younger self. <br><br>The world is seemingly there for the taking. But what does Michael really desire? Mad with lust and losing all scientific objectivity, he runs the gamut of his fantasies inventing new lovers and calling up old ones, until, sated and morally bankrupt, he's forced to confront himself. What happens to the heart when it gets everything it desires?<br><br>From the renowned author of <i>Was</i> and <i>253</i> comes a witty, disturbing and intensely erotic fable for the modern age.<br><br></p><p><br>Geoff Ryman lives in London, England. Among his award-winning works are <i>Was</i> and <i>Unconquered Countries</i>.<br><br>"Reality's got a hole in it." That's what runs through Michael Blasco's head when he discovers that he has the uncanny ability to bring his fantasies to life in this wacky, inspired third novel by Ryman (Was). The 38-year-old gay protagonist is a government scientist experimenting on baby chicks and has a flat in London's West End with Phil, his passionless boyfriend. While seething on a subway platform, he imagines the beefy trainer at his gym stripping naked right in front of him-and poof-it happens! Terrified at first, Michael quickly regains his composure and wills into action a series of characters like Tarzan and cartoon diva Taffy Duck; narcissistically, he also conjures a copy of himself. His reunion with a long-lost high school sweetheart nicknamed Bottles proves to be touching and funny, but his meeting with Mark, a victim of AIDS, turns sad when Mark rebuffs his plea to revive him. In an effort to inject passion into his stagnant relationship, Michael "calls up" a younger version of Phil paired with a younger version of himself. When this scheme backfires, he returns to the anonymous "speedy, functional sex" that has long sustained him. A night out with feisty Billie Holiday, passionate sex with Picasso and dalliances with Lawrence of Arabia on Viagra reinvigorate him and make for some funny, titillating reading, but as Michael's notebook of his wild adventures begins to overflow, the story's whimsical tone changes, revealing more of his true character as well as some particularly troublesome personal problems. Among them is a disturbing boyhood fixation on his father, which mutates into a wincingly unnerving incestuous sequence. Ryman's "careful-what-you-wish-for" message is artfully packaged in this quirky, offbeat, entertaining novel. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>National Electrical Code, 1993</h2><p>Presents the official regulations for wiring and electrical equipment used by the insurance industry</p><p></p><h2>Legends of Modernity: Essays and Letters from Occupied Poland, 1942-1943</h2><p><i>Legends of Modernity</i>, now available in English for the first time, brings together some of Czeslaw Milosz's early essays and letters, composed in German-occupied Warsaw during the winter of 1942-43.<br><br>"Why did the European spirit succumb to such a devastating fiasco?" the young Milosz asks. Half a century later, when <i>Legends of Modernity</i> saw its first publication in Poland, Milosz said: "If everything inside you is agitation, hatred, and despair, write measured, perfectly calm sentences..." While the essays here reflect a "perfect calm," the accompanying contemporaneous exchange of letters between Milosz and Jerzy Andrzejewski express the raw emotions of "agitation, hatred and despair" experienced by these two close friends struggling to understand the proximate causes of this debacle of western civilization, and the relevance, if any, of the teachings of the Catholic church. <br><br>Passionate, poignant, and compelling, <i>Legends of Modernity</i> is a deeply moving insight into the mind and emotions of one of the greatest writers of our time.<br></p><p><b>Czeslaw Milosz</b> (1911-2004) was the winner of the 1978 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature. His last book was <i>To Begin Where I Am</i> (FSG, 2001).<br><br>Czeslaw Milosz is the author of numerous works, many of which have been translated into English, including <i>Beginning with My Streets</i> (FSG, 1992), <i>The Year of the Hunter</i> (FSG, 1994), <i>Road-side Dog</i> (FSG, 1998) <i>Milosz's ABC's</i> (FSG, 2001) and <i>To Begin Where I Am</i> (FSG, 2001). <br><i>Starred Review.</i> In his landmark 1953 book, <i>The Captive Mind</i>, Nobel-winning poet and essayist Milosz discoursed on the havoc totalitarian rule plays on the mental processes of intellectuals. Here we see Milosz's own mind at work in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, crafting essays of ideas, pursuing a fantastically high-minded correspondence with friend and fellow writer Jerzy Andrzejewski, and developing themes inspired by the works of Defoe, Balzac, Gide, Stendhal and Nietzsche. Call it "The Captive Mind in Action." Curiously, the tension implied by Milosz's situation is hardly evident in the essays: where one might expect his tone to be skittish, fearful, foreboding, the most remarkable aspect is his ability to ensconce his steady authorial voice so luxuriantly in the unpressing issues of, say, the imaginative projection required today to view Giotto's medieval saints properly. The most interesting essay demonstrating this phlegmatic tone enlists Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace </i>to help Milosz understand the global conflagration of his own time. But anger, bitterness and self-recrimination rage in some of the letters, where he says he thinks of writing a "confession... that would exceed in its violence and scream of pain, [the] Romantic era's settling of accounts of the conscience." For those who hanker for the high seriousness of continental thinkers like Camus, this volume is a welcome beacon from the past. <i>(Oct. 12)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

E. B. Du Bois, Race, and Visual Culture (a John Hope Franklin Center Book)</h2><p>Through a rich interpretation of the remarkable photographs W. E. B. Du Bois compiled for the American Negro Exhibit at the 1900 Paris Exposition, Shawn Michelle Smith reveals the visual dimension of the color line that Du Bois famously called &#x201c;the problem of the twentieth century.&#x201d; Du Bois&#x2019;s prize-winning exhibit consisted of three albums together containing 363 black-and-white photographs, mostly of middle-class African Americans from Atlanta and other parts of Georgia. Smith provides an extensive analysis of the images, the antiracist message Du Bois conveyed by collecting and displaying them, and their connection to his critical thought. She contends that Du Bois was an early visual theorist of race and racism and demonstrates how such an understanding makes the important concepts he developed&#x2014;including double consciousness, the color line, the Veil, and second sight&#x2014;available to visual culture and African American studies scholars in powerful new ways. <p></p><p>Smith reads Du Bois&#x2019;s photographs in relation to other turn-of-the-century images such as scientific typologies, criminal mugshots, racist caricatures, and lynching photographs. By juxtaposing these images with reproductions from Du Bois&#x2019;s exhibition archive, Smith shows how Du Bois deliberately challenged racist representations of African Americans. Emphasizing the importance of comparing multiple visual archives, <i>Photography on the Color Line</i> reinvigorates understandings of the stakes of representation and the fundamental connections between race and visual culture in the United States.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Photography on the Color Line&#34; should be widely read and widely taught. In this outstanding book, Shawn Michelle Smith has offered not only a spirited reading of a historically important group of photographs but also a methodology and theoretical grounding that are widely applicable even beyond the specific archive of the Du Bois photographs.&#34;--Laura Wexler, author of &#34;Tender Violence: Domestic Visions in an Age of U.S. Imperialism&#34;<p>Shawn Michelle Smith is Associate Professor of American Studies at Saint Louis University.

With over 300 pictures of painting, photography, sculpture, installation, performance and video art, we are led on a fascinating journey via the individuals and communities who have shaped world art. The political and cultural transformations of the early 1980s developed a new era of compatibility between communist states and western-style economics. The art world then expanded to include Russia and China, feminism and racial equality came to the fore, and the World Wide Web was born, changing forever the availability and distribution of visual material. Today we see record-breaking sales of contemporary art and a dramatic rise in the number of students taking courses in the visual and performing arts.

He also provides a complete listing of the all the nominees and winners in every category.<br> <br>Each year is illustrated with evocative stills from winning films and candid shots from the awards ceremony. Altogether, the book features more than 750 rare photographs, including original movie posters for every best picture. Drawing on Osborne's profound knowledge of film, the Academy's exceptional archives, and the personal reminiscences of stars from Katharine Hepburn to Clint Eastwood, <i>85 Years of the Oscar</i> is unrivaled in illustration, accuracy, and completeness.<br></p><p><b>Robert Osborne</b> is host of Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and serves as the official host for the TCM Classic Film Festival and the TCM Classic Cruise. For over 25 years, Osborne served as a reporter and columnist for <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, one of the industry&#x2019;s most important newspapers. He has written a dozen books on the film world, many of them focused on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and has frequently served as host of the Academy&#x2019;s in-person tributes, in both Beverly Hills and New York.

At Academy Award time, the competition was unintentionally outlandish, but eight of the features survived to win Oscars: <i>Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Stagecoach, Wuthering Heights, The Rains Came, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, When Tomorrow Comes,</i> and <i>Goodbye, Mr. Chips.</i> <br> <br> <i>Gone With the Wind,</i> in fact, set a new Oscar numbers record, with eight awards, plus the Irving G. Thalberg award for its producer David O. Selznick. Winning writer Sidney Howard, credited with sole authorship of the final <i>G.W.T.W.</i> script, became the Academy's first posthumous winner. He had died in a Massachusetts farm accident in August, 1939, while the film was still in production. Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., the first president of the Academy, was also posthumously awarded at the 1939 award ceremony, held February 29, 1940, at the Cocoanut Grove of the Los Angeles Ambassador Hotel; Fairbanks had died two months before, and his special award was accepted by his son, Douglas, Jr.<br> <br>For the first time, Bob Hope was an Oscar night master of ceremonies ( What a wonderful thing, this benefit for David Selznick,&#x201d; he kidded). It was the last year the names of winners were told to the press prior to the actual presentation of awards. As in previous times, the Academy tipped off journalists in advance of the festivities, but under strict instructions the results were not to be printed prior to the ceremonial handing out of Oscars. The <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> however, jump the gun and heralded the winners&#x2019; names in their 8:45 p.m. edition, which could be easily read by nominees and guests on their way to the award banquet. It brought on an Academy decision that holds to this day: ever after, the names of the winners would be kept a stony secret from <i>everyone</i> except two representatives of a tight lipped tabulating firm until the actual moment of presentation.

When Taemon loses his psi in a traumatic accident, he must hide his lack of power by any means possible. But a humiliating incident at a sports tournament exposes his disability, and Taemon is exiled to the powerless colony. The "dud farm" is not what Taemon expected, though: people are kind and open, and they actually seem to enjoy using their hands to work and play and even comfort their children. Taemon adjusts to his new life quickly, making friends and finding unconditional acceptance. But gradually he discovers that for all its openness, there are mysteries at the colony, too &#x2014; dangerous secrets that would give unchecked power to psi wielders if discovered. When Taemon unwittingly leaks one of these secrets, will he have the courage to repair the damage &#x2014; even if it means returning to the city and facing the very people who exiled him?</p><p><b>Lana Krumwiede </b>is a debut novelist with many short stories, articles, and poems to her credit. She lives in Richmond, Virginia.Gr 5-7-This dystopian novel packs a punch with an original premise and a fully developed future society. Taemon, 12, lives in a city where everyone can move objects with their minds, a power called psi. One day, while arguing with his brother, he hears a strange voice and is asked to make a difficult choice. His decision costs him his supernatural abilities. Taemon attempts to fake it for a while, but it's next to impossible. Without psi, he can't even feed himself, since using his hands would reveal his secret. It doesn't take long before he ends up exiled to a colony of "powerless" people. The colony isn't as backward as Taemon was raised to believe, though, and there he learns valuable lessons about the power he lost and the power still inside him. Meanwhile, his cruel older brother is being groomed as the True Son, a much-revered individual who, according to prophecy, will bring on the next Sacred Cycle. All of this leads to a gutsy conclusion. While the concept of psi and all of its intricacies is described well, at times the narrative feels repetitive, reminding readers that every action is accomplished using it. However, memorable characters; a smooth, suspenseful plotline; and a fascinating premise make this debut a worthy addition to the genre.

As a teacher, artist and craftsman, Moser had an immense influence on the tastes of his time, with talents that ranged from illustration and graphics to stained glass and the design of stage sets and postage stamps. In 1897 he was a founder member of the Vienna Secession, and in 1903, together with his friend and colleague Josef Hoffmann, he founded the Wiener Werkstatte, whose workshops were to set trends that spread far beyond the boundaries of Austria. He devoted the last years of his life to painting, and in recent times his reputation in this field too has steadily grown.<br>Despite the wealth of information that has survived down the years, Moser's personality remains largely hidden behind his work. Here, Maria Rennhofer connects the many fragments of Moser's personal life, his artistic influences and his multifaceted creativity to form a coherent portrait of this fascinating man. This is not only the first comprehensive account of Moser's life and work to by published in English, but also an in-depth look at the flourishing artistic environment which he did so much to create and shape.</p><p>Maria Rennhofer is a distinguished art historian and the biographer of Gustav Klimt.This beautifully illustrated book is the first monographic treatment in English of an Austrian artist/designer who was a key figure in the Wiener Werkstatte (Vienna Craft Studio), a workshop that produced furniture and decorative objects from artist-made designs. Founded in 1903, the Wiener Werkstatte remained in operation until 1932.<p>Koloman Moser (1868-1918) and Josef Hoffman, the architect, cofounded the Wiener Werkstatte as a place where artists and craftsmen could collaborate creatively. At the Wiener Werkstatte and later, Moser produced masses of designs for decorative objects, which usually featured long-tressed ladies in trailing gowns. <i>Victor Cassidy</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Might as well be Dickens, you know? Eviction? There&#x2019;s got to be a better way.&#x201d;</p> <p>Terrible facts. Great pictures. <i>A perfect newspaper story.</i> She turned to TJ. &#x201c;You getting this?&#x201d;</p> <p>TJ didn&#x2019;t take his eye from the viewfinder. &#x201c;Rolling and recording,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>A blue-shirted Suffolk County sheriff&#x2019;s deputy&#x2014;sleeves rolled up, buzz cut&#x2014;appeared at the open window, took a swig from a plastic bottle. He shaded his eyes with one hand.</p> <p>&#x201c;First floor, all clear,&#x201d; he called. Two uniforms comparing paperwork on the gravel driveway gave him a thumbs-up. The Boston cops were detailed in, they&#x2019;d explained to Jane, in case there were protesters. But no pickets or housing activists had appeared. Not even a curious neighbor. The deputy twisted the cap on the bottle, tossed away the empty with a flip of his gloved hand. The clear plastic bounced on top of a brittle hedge, then disappeared into the browning grass.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oops,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m headed for the back.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s harsh,&#x201d; TJ muttered.</p> <p>&#x201c;You got it, though, right?&#x201d; Jane knew it was a &#x201c;moment&#x201d; for her story, revealing the deputy&#x2019;s cavalier behavior while the Sandovals&#x2014;she looked around, making sure the family hadn&#x2019;t shown up&#x2014;were off searching for a new place to live. The feds kept reporting the housing crisis was over. Tell that to the now-homeless Sandovals, crammed&#x2014;temporarily, they hoped&#x2014;into a relative&#x2019;s spare bedroom. Their modest ranch home in this cookie-cutter neighborhood was now an REO&#x2014;&#x201c;real estate owned&#x201d; by Atlantic &amp; Anchor Bank. The metal sign on the scrabby lawn said FORECLOSED in yellow block letters. Under the provisions of the Massachusetts Housing Court, the deputies were now in charge.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey! Television! You can&#x2019;t shoot here. It&#x2019;s private property.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jane felt a hand clamp onto her bare arm. She twisted away, annoyed. Of course they could shoot.</p> <p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; She eyed the guy&#x2019;s three-piece pinstripe suit, ridiculous on a day like today. He must be melting. Still, being hot didn&#x2019;t give him the right to be wrong. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on the public sidewalk. We can shoot whatever we can see and hear.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jane stashed her notebook into her tote bag, then held out a hand, conciliatory. Maybe he knew something. &#x201c;And not television. Newspaper. The new online edition. I&#x2019;m Jane Ryland, from the <i>Register.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>She paused. Lawyer, banker, bean counter, she predicted. For A&amp;A Bank? Or the Sandovals? The Sandovals had already told her, on camera, how Elliot Sandoval had lost his construction job, and they were struggling on pregnant MaryLou&#x2019;s day care salary. Struggling and failing.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care who you are.&#x201d; The man crossed his arms over his chest, a chunky watch glinting, tortoiseshell sunglasses hiding his expression. &#x201c;This is none of your business. You don&#x2019;t tell your friend to shut off that camera, I&#x2019;m telling the cops to stop you.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>You kidding me?</i> &#x201c;Feel free, Mr.&#x2014;?&#x201d; Jane took her hand away. Felt a trickle of sweat down her back. Boston was baking in the throes of an unexpected May heat wave. Everyone was cranky. It was almost too hot to argue. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find we&#x2019;re within our rights.&#x201d;</p> <p>The guy pulled out a phone. All she needed. And stupid, because the cops were right there. TJ kept shooting, good for him. Brand new at the Boston <i>Register,</i> videographer TJ Foy was hire number one in the paper&#x2019;s fledgling online video news department. Jane was the first&#x2014;and so far, only&#x2014;reporter assigned.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a chance to show off your years of TV experience,&#x201d; the <i>Register</i>&#x2019;s new city editor had explained. Pretending Jane had a choice. &#x201c;Make it work.&#x201d;</p> <p>Pleasing the new boss was never a bad thing, and truth be told, Jane could use a little employment security. She still suffered pangs from her unfair firing from Channel 11 last year, but at least it didn&#x2019;t haunt her every day. This was her new normal, especially now that newspapering was more like TV. &#x201c;Multimedia,&#x201d; her new editor called it.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing a story on the housing crisis.&#x201d; Jane smiled, trying again. &#x201c;Remember the teenager who got killed last week on Springvale Street? Emily-Sue Ordway? Fell from a window, trying to get back into her parents&#x2019; foreclosed home? We&#x2019;re trying to show&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not about the houses so much as it is the people.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2018;The people&#x2019; should pay their mortgage.&#x201d; The man pointed to the clapboard two-story with his cell phone. &#x201c;Then &#x2018;the cops&#x2019; wouldn&#x2019;t have to &#x2018;remove&#x2019; their possessions.&#x201d;</p> <p>Okay, so not a lawyer for the Sandovals. But at least this jerk wasn&#x2019;t dialing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you with A&amp;A? With the bank?&#x201d; Might as well be direct.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not any of&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Vitucci! Callum!&#x201d; The deputy appeared in the open front door, one hand on each side of the doorjamb as if to keep himself upright. He held the screen door open with his foot. His smirk had vanished. The two cops on the driveway alerted, inquiring.</p> <p>&#x201c;Huh? What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; one asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;You getting this?&#x201d; Jane whispered. She didn&#x2019;t want to ruin TJ&#x2019;s audio with her voice, but something was happening. Something the eviction squad hadn&#x2019;t expected.</p> <p>&#x201c;Second floor.&#x201d; The deputy pulled a radio from his belt pouch. Looked at it. Looked back at the cops. His shoulders sagged. &#x201c;Better get in here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Hank Phillippi Ryan</p></p><h2>Bone Collection: Animals</h2><p>See what lies beneath an animal's skin!<br><br>BONE COLLECTION: ANIMALS will feature a wide selection of animal skeletons and informative facts so kids can learn about the anatomy of their favorite animals.

From the faux leather journal cover to the interior parchment-colored paper, and the page numbers printed atop grayed-out images of skulls, this excellent package has a distinctly vintage feel. The book first introduces bony skeletons (&#x201c;without bones, we would collapse into jelly on the floor!&#x201d;) and vertebrates before moving from animal to animal so that young readers can get the (literal) inside scoop on backbones. And despite the apparent differences in shape between, say, an Atlantic cod and a red kangaroo, this title makes the point that, when you come right down to it, skeletons are &#x201c;surprisingly similar&#x201d; between species. Each of the skeletons support a particular animal&#x2019;s ability to function in the wild (seals have flexible backs that allow them to swim with ease). With labeled skeletons, photographs, additional facts &#x201c;paper-clipped&#x201d; onto the page, and a straightforward text&#x2014;all presented scrapbook-style&#x2014;this is an informative look at the bone structures of animal and human bodies.

He is the author of <i>Treatment of Abuse and Addiction: A Holistic Approach</i>.<br><br>Katherine Ketcham is the author of many books, including <i>Chinese Medicine for Maximum Immunity</i> and <i>The Five Elements of Self-Healing</i>.In an engaging work that is part guidebook and part heartfelt meditation, Ciaramicoli, a practicing psychologist who rejects the pervasive medical practice of labeling and medicating human anguish, contends that it is empathy--not fear, not sympathy, not drugs--that holds the key to mental health. Arguing that the "capacity to understand and respond to the unique experiences of another" is not only ubiquitous in relationships but is actually "an innate force, part of our biological inheritance" that is necessary for survival, he ponders empathy's many faces (including its "dark side") in the first half of the book. In the second half, he describes, and coaches readers on practicing the eight expressions of empathy: honesty, humility, acceptance, tolerance, gratitude, faith, hope and forgiveness. Inspired, in part, by his brother's suicide 26 years ago (which he believes was caused partly by a failure of empathy), Ciaramicoli vigorously examines empathy's place in an astonishing array of everyday situations--in sexual intimacy and friendly banter, in the natural world and the arena of sales and advertising--as a force of evil and a force of good. In the end, Ciaramicoli's meticulous exploration of the "invisible connections" of true empathy illuminates how the reader can use this long-misunderstood social skill to live a more safe and fulfilled life.

Elisha is a leading scholar in Palestine, elected to the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish court in the land. But two tragedies awaken doubt about God in Elisha's mind, and doubt eats away at his faith. Declared a heretic and excommunicated from the Jewish community, he journeys to Antioch in nearby Syria to begin a quest through Greek and Roman culture for some fundamental irrefutable truth.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, in which the hobbit Frodo and his elfish friends get swept up in a mighty conflict with the dark lord Sauron (who owes much to proud Satan in <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the monstrous Gollum, the Cracks of Doom, and the awful power of the magical Ring. The book's characters--good and evil--are recognizably human, and the realism is deepened by the magnificent detail of the vast parallel world Tolkien devised, inspired partly by his influential Anglo-Saxon scholarship and his Christian beliefs. (He disapproved of the relative sparseness of detail in the comparable allegorical fantasy his friend C.S. Lewis dreamed up in the Chronicles of Narnia, though he knew Lewis had spun a page-turning yarn.) It has been estimated that one-tenth of all paperbacks sold can trace their ancestry to J.R.R. Tolkien. But even if we had never gotten Robert Jordan's <i>The Path of Daggers</i> and the whole fantasy genre Tolkien inadvertently created by bringing the hobbits so richly to life, Tolkien's epic about the Ring would have left our world enhanced by enchantment. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Includes the 50th anniversary fully corrected text setting and an extensive new index"An extraordinary work -- pure excitement." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them <br>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others.

From Jack Bogle's never-before-published 1951 Princeton thesis to more than two dozen essays covering five decades of investing, it is a 50-year compendium of the work and wisdom of one of the world's most important financial figures. </p><p>Investors at all levels will profit from insights including: </p><ul> <li>Recommendations for ensuring 100% of market returns </li><li>Thoughts on indexing��from the "Father of the Index Fund" </li><li>Ways to keep today's turbulent markets in perspective </li></ul> <p><b>Praise for the International Bestseller <i>Bogle on Mutual Funds</i>:</b> </p><p>"Any investor who owns or is thinking of owning shares in a fund should read this book cover to cover."<br>��Warren Buffett, Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. </p><p>"This book sets the ultimate benchmark for all how-to-invest books."<br>��Peter L. Bernstein, Economic Consultant, Author, <i>Against the Gods</i> </p><p>"A long-time student of the mutual fund industry, Bogle is both its harshest critic and its greatest friend. He is, in effect, the conscience of the industry..."<br>��Don Phillips, CEO, Morningstar</p></p><p>John C. Bogle (Valley Forge, PA) is founder and former chairman of The Vanguard Group, the world's largest no-load mutual fund company. Bogle founded the first index mutual fund, pioneered the modern no-load mutual fund, and showed millions of everyday investors how to think and invest for themselves. <p>In 1999, Fortune named Bogle one of the four investment giants of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>John Bogle��Vanguard Founder and No-Load Pioneer��Talks about Finance, Economics, Mutual Funds, Stewardship, and Idealism</b> </p><p>John C. Bogle is one of the 20th century's towering financial giants. Deeply concerned by the devastating impact of high mutual fund costs on the long-term returns earned by investors, he founded Vanguard in 1974. In the space of a few years, he introduced the index mutual fund, pioneered the modern no-load mutual fund, and redefined bond fund management. By creating a novel mutual mutual fund enterprise owned by its shareholders, he gave millions of investors a new and high-powered way to invest and was among the first authoritative voices to challenge the financial establishment. </p><p>And John Bogle is still in there fighting. <i>John Bogle on Investing</i> contains the best of the scores of speeches he's delivered over the years and revisits the important investment themes from which Bogle rarely strayed during his illustrious career: </p><ul> <li>The majesty of simplicity in investment strategy </li><li>The productive economics of long-term investing </li><li>The counterproductive emotions that can forfeit investment success </li><li>The universality of indexing in the financial markets </li><li>Minimizing the "fiscal drag" of sales charges, management fees, turnover costs, and opportunity cost </li></ul> <p>Within these covers you will find nothing less than the rock solid foundation of success in independent investing for the 21st century. Tough, insightful, and relentless in its drive for fairness and honesty, <i>John Bogle on Investing</i> creates a high standard for McGraw-Hill's new Great Ideas in Finance series��and then surpasses that standard, page after page. </p><p>"John C. Bogle . . . has the mind of an economist and the personality of a preacher."<br>��<i>Washington Post</i> </p><p>One half century ago, an "insecure but determined" Princeton undergrad was already showing signs of becoming a maverick. Barely out of his teens but already firm in his convictions that mutual fund shareholders were not receiving a fair shake, the budding financier turned in an exhaustively researched magna cum laude thesis entitled The Economic Role of the Investment Company. </p><p>That student was John Clifton Bogle, and that thesis��groundbreaking, innovative, and reprinted word-for-word in these pages for the first time��unalterably changed the future course of investing. <i>John Bogle on Investing</i> is a 50-year compendium that recounts in the best possible words��his own��the storied career of Jack Bogle, the man who has been called "the conscience of the mutual fund industry." </p><p>"Bogle is rattling the status quo among the mutual fund titans."��<i>Fortune</i> </p><p>In its 26 chapters, <i>John Bogle on Investing</i> presents 25 speeches and one masterful thesis. They all revolve around one common theme: Efficient, economical, and honest alternatives must be made available to all investors of all wealth levels. Just as important, these investors must understand the choices available to them. From sensible discussions of wealth accumulation and investment risk, through a provocative call-to-arms regarding investment costs, each selection is exceptionally well written, meticulously researched, and documented with charts and graphs. In all, the book is classic Bogle. Whether discussing the virtues of low-expense indexing ("Low cost, marginal in its annual impact, becomes overwhelming as the years roll on") or the hazards that bull markets may create ("When reward is at its pinnacle, risk is near at hand"), John Bogle never fails to lay his cards face-up on the table for all to see. And we, the readers, emerge the winners. </p><p>If you are serious about substantially improving your long-term investment returns, and you read just one book this year, make it <i>John Bogle on Investing</i>. If you plan on reading two books, you should consider reading <i>John Bogle on Investing</i> twice. </p><p>It's that valuable, that entertaining, and that good. John Bogle is one of the great financial figures of the 20th century, and this book encapsulates much of the work and wisdom of his 50-year mutual fund career. By reading <i>John Bogle on Investing</i>, you can learn in one evening much of the knowledge John Bogle spent 50 years acquiring. </p><p>In a lifetime devoted to giving a fair shake to the human beings who invest to secure their financial futures, this book may be Bogle's best bargain yet.</p></p><h2>Murder on the Orient Express Leather Bound</h2><p>New Barnes &amp; Noble Exclusive Collectible Edition</p><p></p><h2>Return to Horrorland (Goosebumps Series 2000, No 13)</h2><p>Accompanied by television reporters, Lizzy and Luke once again brave the perils of Horrorland to show the world the deadly dangers of the park, only to come face to face with such new attractions as Torture Mountain, the Dungeon of No Return, and Buzzard Beach.

This one is a bit preachy in spots and sometimes dated (though in truth, I wish the medical stuff was more dated, but that&#x2019;s another matter). You might think I based part of this on a &#x201c;real-life&#x201d; situation. I didn&#x2019;t. This book predates that event. I won&#x2019;t say more because it could be a spoiler.</p><p>Finally, flawed and all, I love this book. There are an energy and risk-taking in <i>Miracle Cure</i> that I wonder if I still have.

Bruce Grey tried not to walk too fast. He slowed his pace, fighting off the temptation to sprint across the soiled floor of Kennedy Airport&#x2019;s International Arrivals Building, past the customs officials, and out into the humid night air. His eyes shifted from side to side. Every few steps he would feign a soreness in his neck to give himself the opportunity to glance behind him and make sure he was not being followed.</p><p><i>Stop it!</i> Bruce told himself. <i>Stop lurking around like a poor man&#x2019;s James Bond. You&#x2019;re shaking like a malaria patient, for chrissake. You couldn&#x2019;t look more conspicuous if you wore a sign.</i></p><p>He strolled past the luggage carousel, nodding politely at the little old lady who had sat next to him on the flight. The old woman had not shut her mouth during the entire trip, gabbing on about her family, her love of flying, her last trip overseas. She was sweet enough, just somebody&#x2019;s grandmother, but Bruce still closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep in order to get a little peace and quiet. But, of course, sleep had not come to him. It would not come for some time yet.</p><p><i>But maybe she wasn&#x2019;t just some sweet, little old lady, Brucie boy. Maybe she was following you</i> . . .</p><p>He dismissed the voice with a nervous shake of the head. This whole thing was turning his brain into sewer sludge. First, he was sure that the bearded man on the plane had been following him. Then it was the big guy with the slicked-back hair and Armani suit at the telephone booth. And don&#x2019;t forget the pretty blonde by the terminal exit. She had been following him too.</p><p>Now it was a little old lady.</p><p><i>Get a grip on yourself, Brucie. Paranoia is not what we need right now. Clear thinking, old pal&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re looking for.</i></p><p>Bruce moved past the luggage carousel and over to the customs official.</p><p>&#x201c;Passport, please.&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce handed the man his passport.</p><p>&#x201c;No luggage, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;Only this carry-on.&#x201d;</p><p>The customs officer glanced at the passport and then at Bruce. &#x201c;You look quite different from your photograph.&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce tried to force a tired smile to his lips but it would not hold. The humidity was almost unbearable. His dress shirt was pasted against his skin, his tie loosened to the point of being nearly untied. Beads of perspiration dotted his forehead. &#x201c;I . . . I&#x2019;ve gone through a few changes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A few? You&#x2019;re a dark-haired man with a beard in this picture.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re a clean-shaven blond.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said, I went through a few changes.&#x201d; <i>Luckily, you can&#x2019;t tell eye color from a passport photo or you would want to know why I changed my eyes from brown to blue.</i></p><p>The customs official did not appear convinced. &#x201c;Were you traveling on business or pleasure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pleasure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You always pack this lightly?&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce swallowed and managed a shrug. &#x201c;I hate waiting for checked luggage.&#x201d;</p><p>The customs official swung his line of vision from the passport photograph to Bruce&#x2019;s face and then back again. &#x201c;Would you open your bag, please?&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce could barely keep his hands steady enough to set the combination. It took him three tries before it finally snapped open. &#x201c;There you go.&#x201d;</p><p>The customs official&#x2019;s eyes narrowed into thin slits as he rummaged through the belongings. &#x201c;What are these?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>Bruce closed his eyes, his breath coming in short gasps. &#x201c;Some files.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; the official replied. &#x201c;What are they for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a doctor,&#x201d; Bruce explained, his voice cracking. &#x201c;I wanted to review some of my patients&#x2019; charts while I was away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you always do that when you&#x2019;re on vacation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not always.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What type of doctor are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An internist at Columbia Presbyterian,&#x201d; Bruce replied, telling a half-truth. He decided to leave out the fact that he was also an expert in public health and epidemiology.</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; the official replied. &#x201c;I wish my doctor was that dedicated.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Bruce tried to smile. Again it was a failed attempt.</p><p>&#x201c;And this sealed envelope?&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce felt his whole body quake. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is in this manila envelope?&#x201d;</p><p>He willed a casual look on his face. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s just some medical information I&#x2019;m sending to a colleague,&#x201d; he managed.</p><p>The customs official&#x2019;s eyes locked onto Bruce&#x2019;s bloodshot ones for a few long moments. &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; he said, slowly putting the envelope back in the bag. When the customs official finished going through the rest of the carry-on, he signed Bruce&#x2019;s customs declaration and handed him back his passport. &#x201c;Give the card to the woman on your way out.&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce reached for the bag. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And, Doctor?&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce looked up.</p><p>&#x201c;You might want to visit one of your colleagues,&#x201d; the customs official said. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind a layman giving medical opinions, you look awful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that.&#x201d;</p><p>Bruce lifted the bag and glanced behind him. The little old lady was still waiting for her luggage. The man with the beard and the pretty blonde were nowhere in sight. The big guy in the Armani suit was still talking on the phone.</p><p>Bruce moved away from the customs desk. His right hand gripped his bag with excessive vigor; his left hand rubbed his face. He handed the customs declaration to the woman and walked through the sliding glass doors into the waiting area. A sea of anxious faces greeted him. People stood on their toes, peering out from all points with each swish of the glass doors before lowering their heads in disappointment when an unfamiliar face approached the threshold.</p><p>Bruce moved steadily past the waiting friends and relatives, past the bored limousine drivers with name signs held up against their chests. He made his way to the Japan Airlines ticket counter on the right.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there a mailbox near here?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;To your right,&#x201d; the woman replied. &#x201c;By the Air France desk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>He walked by a garbage can and casually dropped his torn-up boarding pass into it. He had considered himself very clever to book the flight under an assumed name&#x2014;very clever, that was, until he got to the airport and was informed that you could not have an international ticket issued under a different name from the one on your passport.</p><p>Whoops.</p><p>Luckily, there had been plenty of space on the flight. Even though he had to purchase another ticket for himself, reserving one under an alias had not been such a dumb idea. Before his actual departure date, no one could have found out what flight he was booked on because his name was not in the computer. Pure genius on his part.</p><p><i>Yessiree, Brucie. You are a regular genius.</i></p><p>Yeah, right. Genius. Bullshit.</p><p>He located the mail slot near the Air France desk. A few passengers spoke to the airline representative. None of them paid him the slightest attention. His eyes quickly checked the room. The old lady, the bearded man, and the pretty blonde had either left or were still going through customs.

Today, low-cost, no-frill airlines enable lots of people to fly easily and to visit different countries around the world. For much of its history, however, air travel was only available to the wealthy. This book explores the golden age of air travel from the 1930s to the 1970s when flying was the epitome of status, and the airlines offered a sumptuous service with the journey being all important. The dramatic changes in the quality of air travel are highlighted, as are the different types of aircraft employed by the air travel companies, including airships, jetliners and Concorde. The emphasis, however, is on conveying to the reader what it was like to be a passenger on board these commercial flights as well as the experience of those serving with the airlines.</p><p>Nina Hadaway has been Curator of Documents at the Royal Air Force Museum since 2003.

A place where, in our increasingly interconnected, digital world, it's still possible to wander for months without crossing a single road, or even see another human being. <br><br>Between his starting point in Eagle Plains, Yukon Territory, to his destination in Baker Lake, Nunavut, lies a maze of obstacles: shifting ice floes, swollen rivers, fog-bound lakes, and gale-force storms. And Shoalts must time his departure by the breakup of the spring ice, then sprint across nearly 4,000 kilometers of rugged, wild terrain to arrive before winter closes in. <br><br>He travels alone up raging rivers that only the most expert white-water canoeists dare travel even downstream. He must portage across fields of jagged rocks that stretch to the horizon, and navigate labyrinths of swamps, tormented by clouds of mosquitoes every step of the way. And the race against the calendar means that he cannot afford the luxuries of rest, or of making mistakes. Shoalts must trek tirelessly, well into the endless Arctic summer nights, at times not even pausing to eat. <br><br>But his reward is the adventure of a lifetime.<br><br>Heart-stopping, wonder-filled, and attentive to the majesty of the natural world, Beyond the Trees captures the ache for adventure that afflicts us all.</p><p>Adam Shoalts has been called one of Canada&#39;s greatest living explorers and in 2018 was named an Explorer-in-Residence of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. He is also an historian, archaeologist, and geographer, and his book Alone Against the North was a #1 national bestseller. His second book, A History of Canada in Ten Maps was also national bestseller. Shoalts holds a Ph.D. from McMaster University where his doctoral research examined the influence Indigenous oral traditions had on explorers and fur traders in Canada&#39;s subarctic and Pacific Northwest. He has done archaeology in four countries and enjoys long walks in the woods.My passion was paddling wild rivers and lakes, and wandering silently through quiet forests, indulging my curiosity about plants, trees, and the mystery and enchantment of the natural world. Adventures I&#x2019;d had and would continue to do so, because it came with the terrain of wandering alone through wild places. But I didn&#x2019;t anticipate making any particularly long journeys in the Arctic.<br><br>Then, in the spring of 2010, I happened to visit a local nature club in the Short Hills&#x2014;a region of wooded, rolling hills, tumbling streams, and waterfalls south of Lake Ontario&#x2014;which put in motion a chain of events that led to my becoming windbound alone on an arctic lake. No doubt that&#x2019;s a common occurrence stemming from nature club meetings, and a prudent reason to avoid them. As far as nature clubs went, this one had a youngish membership, the average age being barely more than mid-seventies.<br><br>It was there at the nature club&#x2019;s meeting hall, after my presentation on canoe tripping had wrapped up, that I first heard the word &#x201c;sesquicentennial&#x201d; used in a sentence. I&#x2019;d been chatting with a white-haired man, a retired professor of chemistry.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;2017 is going to be Canada&#x2019;s sesquicentennial.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said, nodding. In fact I hadn&#x2019;t known this.<br><br>He kept looking at me, apparently awaiting a further response.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure what &#x201c;sesquicentennial&#x201d; even meant.<br><br>&#x201c;The 150th anniversary of Canada&#x2019;s Confederation,&#x201d; he elaborated.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I replied.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s sure to be a big deal. Huge celebrations,&#x201d; he said with emphasis. &#x201c;I remember the Centennial celebrations back in 1967. We went to Expo 67 in Montreal for that. &#x2019;Course, that would&#x2019;ve been well before your time.&#x201d;<br><br>The connection between my canoe trips and a 150th anniversary, which was still seven years away, wasn&#x2019;t immediately obvious to me.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a very big occasion,&#x201d; the old man resumed. &#x201c;Have you given any thought to doing something special for it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er, no, I haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head, evidently dismayed at the lamentable failure of my education. &#x201c;Back in &#x2019;67 I remember there were people who canoed across Canada. Maybe you should think of doing something similar in 2017? There&#x2019;s bound to be lots of funding opportunities and groups interested in that kind of thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, anything&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Still, 2017 seemed a long way off, and I thought it unlikely that something as obscure as a sesquicentennial would attract much notice beyond the ordinary July 1 fireworks. I soon put it out of my mind and returned to paddling wild rivers, observing plants and animals, wandering the woods, and, for a while, pursuing a passion I&#x2019;d developed for the study of rare mosses found on certain rocks, especially the species <i>ptychomitrium incurvum</i>.<br><br>But a few years later, the old professor&#x2019;s supposition proved correct. As 2017 neared, &#x201c;Canada 150&#x201d; seemed to crop up more and more in conversations and news stories.<br><br>A great many plans were underway. There would be public infrastructure projects. Free access to national parks. A ship travelling around Canada with a hundred and fifty passengers chosen from across the country. Trees planted in every province and territory. Tulips bedded in Ottawa&#x2019;s public gardens (300,000 of them, a unique&nbsp;species) that resembled the country&#x2019;s flag. An actual flag (a massive one) raised to the top of a pole (fourteen storeys high). Eventually, the federal government would fund nearly six thousand of these Canada 150 initiatives.<br><br>Meanwhile, over three years had passed since my encounter with the old professor at the nature club. I recalled what he&#x2019;d said about the Centennial canoe trip. Maybe, I thought to myself, another cross-Canada canoe journey might, in some small way, inspire people to care more about the fate of the country&#x2019;s ever-diminishing wild places. I decided to look up what exactly had been done in 1967. It was fortuitous perhaps, that I did so at a time when I was under one of those spells of wanderlust and adventure that had a habit of stealing over me whenever I was shut up inside for too long.<br><br>It turned out that ten teams of canoeists had paddled from central Alberta to Montreal. Dubbed &#x201c;The Centennial Voyageur Canoe Pageant,&#x201d; the journey involved ten people per team; six at a time would paddle on alternating days while the other four rested. The route included stops in cities and towns along the way, where parties and fanfare greeted the paddlers&#x2019; arrival. By starting east of the Rockies and ending in Montreal, the hardest portages and upstream travel were avoided. When it was all over it took 104 days to complete and covered 5,283 kilometres, ending in celebration at Expo 67.<br><br>Now that&#x2019;s a remarkable journey, I thought to myself as I sat in my cluttered study on the ground floor of a rundown Victorian house I rented. And to recreate it fifty years later would be quite a thing. But nowadays, given that Canada&#x2019;s a lot less wild than it was in 1967, I figured somebody could probably retrace that canoe route and stop in at a Tim Hortons every third day. What could I do in 2017 that hadn&#x2019;t already been done?<br><br>I stared at the map of Canada on the wall above my desk (a dangerous thing&#x2014;staring at maps, that is). What if, I wondered, I shifted the canoe route north? Roughly, say, two thousand kilometres north, beyond the trees to the tundra?<br><br>Unlike the 1967 route, a canoe journey that far north wouldn&#x2019;t have a line of cities or towns to break up the journey and allow for resupply, not to mention hot showers and human encouragement. Instead of travelling through farmland and cottage country, it&#x2019;d mean travelling across arctic terrain. The elements would be much harsher, with sub-zero temperatures, snow, bitterly cold winds, shifting ice floes, and probably no Tim Hortons. If something went wrong, help would be far away and a long time coming. To further complicate matters, there was no easy or obvious water route across the mainland Canadian Arctic. Four major watersheds would have to be crossed, meaning a lot of overland and arduous upstream travel would be required.<br><br>I suppose it was a mad idea. On the other hand, it was exactly the kind of undertaking that appealed to me, or at least appealed to me in my more adventurous moods. After all, as I often remarked to myself, you only live once.</p><h2>Forever Beach: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<em>Beach Colors</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Breakwater Bay</em>&nbsp;comes this heartwarming story of love, family, and redemption.

You'll find concrete, actionable advice for tackling the massive obstacle of behavioral change, and learn how to design and implement an approach that can most benefit your organization.</p> <p>Promoting wellness is a good idea. Giving employees the inspiration and tools they need to make changes in their lifestyles is a <i>great</i> idea. But the billion-dollar question is: what do they want, what do they need, and how do we implement programs to help them without causing more harm than good? <i>Workplace Wellness That Works</i> shows you how to assess your organization's needs and craft a plan that actually benefits employees.</p> <ul> <li>Build an effective platform for well-being</li> <li>Empower employees to make better choices</li> <li>Design and deliver the strategy that your organization needs</li> <li>Drive quantifiable change through more creative implementation</li> </ul> <p>Today's worksite wellness industry represents a miasma of competing trends, making it nearly impossible to come away with tangible solutions for real-world implementation.

For starters, the rates of obesity, stress, and lifestyle-related disease continue to rise. Nearly half of all Americans now suffer from some form of chronic health condition. This is enormously expensive to both society and business. Making matters worse, traditional methods of encouraging workplace wellness don't necessarily cut costs either&#x2014;the evidence of ROI for wellness programs is mixed at best. <i>Workplace Wellness that Works</i> brings a breath of fresh air to this current state of affairs. </p><p>In this book, top wellness consultant and sought-after speaker Laura Putnam shows how to take an outside-the-box, more effective approach to designing wellness programs. She illustrates why true health and well-being cannot be mandated but must be pursued voluntarily. <i>Workplace Wellness that Works</i> offers avenues to generate inspiration at all levels of an organization and infuse well-being into the workplace. Readers will learn how to move beyond top-down compliance initiatives and build well-being directly into their organizational cultures. Research clearly shows that simply putting wellness programs in place does not necessarily guarantee employee participation. The steps in <i>Workplace Wellness that Works</i> address this dilemma and provide guidance on engaging people in their own well-being and tying health and wellness to overall performance improvement. </p><p>Businesses that have taken a more creative approach to workplace wellness have achieved outstanding results. Using a practical 10-step path to creating and implementing an innovative wellness program, Laura Putnam shows that cultures of vitality are not just for cutting-edge companies but can be achieved in any organization. <i>Workplace Wellness that Works</i> provides thoughtful tips on how to generate leadership engagement and, when necessary, how to "sneak" wellness-related elements into organizational development. </p><p>Change is always a challenge, and the best new initiatives are context-sensitive. These two truths are woven seamlessly into <i>Workplace Wellness that Works</i>, which provides examples, resources, and action items for taking an evolutionary approach to promoting employee health and well-being. Whereas many authors have devised one-size-fits-all frameworks for workplace wellness, Laura Putnam shows readers a research-based path to identifying what will work best in their unique situations. This innovative approach will help wellness and human resources professionals, as well as managers and executives, re-frame the way they think about health and well-being in the workplace.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>Workplace Wellness that Works</i></b> </p><p>"Laura Putnam's insights coupled with compelling stories and tangible action items will help any organization adopt a more creative approach toward transforming culture and influencing well-being at work." <br><b>&#x2014;Chip Conley,</b> Airbnb Head of Global Hospitality and Strategy, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Emotional Equations</i> </p><p>"A great book that inspires and spells out a better way to promote well-being in the workplace.

Drawing on the work of four ESL teachers who pursued anti-racist pedagogical practices during their first year of teaching, the author provides a compelling account of how new teachers might gain agency for culturally responsive teaching in spite of school cultures that often discourage such approaches. She combines current research and original analyses to shed light on real classroom situations faced by teachers of linguistically diverse populations. This book will help pre- and inservice teachers to think about such challenges as differential achievement between language learners and &#x201c;native-speakers&#x201d;; hierarchies of languages and language varieties; the difference between an accent identity and an incorrect pronunciation; and the use of students&#x2019; first languages in English classes.

It is a human profession, practiced by people who have dedicated their lives not only to science but also to humanity. In the words of the great physician-writer Sir William Osler, "The physician needs a clear head and a kind heart; his work is arduous and complex, requiring the exercise of the very highest faculties of the mind, while constantly appealing to the emotions and higher feelings." It is the humanity in medicine that has inspired the pens of countless writers, and that has now been captured in this remarkable anthology of medical literature.<br><br>This newly expanded edition of <i>On Doctoring</i> is an extraordinary collection of stories, poems, and essays written by physicians and non-physicians alike -- works that eloquently record what it is like to be sick, to be cured, to lose, or to triumph. Drawing on the full spectrum of human emotions, the editors have included selections from such important and diverse writers as Anton Chekhov, W. H. Auden, William Carlos Williams, John Keats, John Donne, Robert Coles, Pablo Neruda, Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, Alice Walker, Kurt Vonnegut, and Abraham Verghese. Among the new authors included in this edition are Rainer Maria Rilke, Lisel Mueller, and May Sarton.<br><br>In this era of managed healthcare, when medicine is becoming more institutionalized and impersonal, this book recaptures the breadth and the wonder of the medical profession. Presenting the issues, concerns, and challenges facing doctors and patients alike, <i>On Doctoring</i> is at once illuminating and provocative, a compelling record of the human spirit.</p><p><b>Richard C.

Its president, Mino Arakawa, was stuck with two thousand unsold arcade cabinets for a dud of a game (<i>Radar Scope</i>). So he hatched a plan.</p><p>Back in Japan, a boyish, shaggy-haired staff artist named Shigeru Miyamoto designed a new game for the unsold cabinets featur�ing an angry gorilla and a small jumping man. <i>Donkey Kong </i>brought in $180 million in its first year alone and launched the career of a short, chubby plumber named Mario.</p><p>Since then, Mario has starred in over two hundred games, gen�erating profits in the billions. He is more recognizable than Mickey Mouse, yet he&#x2019;s little more than a mustache in bib overalls. How did a mere smear of pixels gain such huge popularity?</p><p><i>Super Mario </i>tells the story behind the Nintendo games millions of us grew up with, explaining how a Japanese trading card company rose to dominate the fiercely competitive video-game industry.</p></p><p><b>Jeff Ryan</b>, a lifelong gamer, has been featured on Salon.com and All Things Considered. He reviewed over 500 video games and covered four console launches as the games editor for Katrillion, a popular dotcom-era news and entertainment Web site. He lives in Bloomfield, New Jersey.The history of how a Japanese video game featuring two Italian brothers became one of America's favorite pastimes is covered in exhaustive, enthusiastic detail by video game reviewer Ryan. The author takes readers through Nintendo's early business machinations; the story of Mario's eccentric creator, Shigeru Miyamoto; and the game-changing emergence of Nintendo's motion controller for the Wii, with a breezy journalistic style. At times the tone slips into the white hat&#x2013;black hat morality employed in most video games, often painting Nintendo's business competitors or detractors with broad reductive strokes&#x2014;"hardcore gamers sneer at Wii"&#x2014;and paeans to new Nintendo releases get smattered with exclamation points, so that some pages read like Nintendo promo material. All of this is distracting but not fatal, and the book is a thorough history of Nintendo's victories, written by an enthusiastic and knowledgeable fan. (Aug.)</p><h2>Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen : Reflections on Sixty and Beyond</h2><p>In a lucid, brilliant work of nonfiction -- as close to an autobiography as his readers are likely to get -- Larry McMurtry has written a family portrait that also serves as a larger portrait of Texas itself, as it was and as it has become. <br> Using as a springboard an essay by the German literary critic Walter Benjamin that he first read in Archer City's Dairy Queen, McMurtry examines the small-town way of life that big oil and big ranching have nearly destroyed. He praises the virtues of everything from a lime Dr. Pepper to the lost art of oral storytelling, and describes the brutal effect of the sheer vastness and emptiness of the Texas landscape on Texans, the decline of the cowboy, and the reality and the myth of the frontier. <br> McMurtry writes frankly and with deep feeling about his own experiences as a writer, a parent, and a heart patient, and he deftly lays bare the raw material that helped shape his life's work: the creation of a vast, ambitious, fictional panorama of Texas in the past and the present. Throughout, McMurtry leaves his readers with constant reminders of his all-encompassing, boundless love of literature and books.</p><p>Do you really want to listen to a cranky old man ramble on about his childhood, his heart surgery, his hobbies, his son, and the way things, in general, aren't what they used to be? It turns out you do. In <i>Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen</i>, Larry McMurtry comes the old pardner, and the result is a powerful elegy for the lost spaces in American life. He takes as his starting point an afternoon he spent at the Dairy Queen in Archer City, Texas, reading the <i>pens�es</i> of early 20th-century German philosopher Walter Benjamin. At the time Benjamin was writing, McMurtry's grandparents were settling dusty reaches of west Texas, and McMurtry crosscuts neatly between Benjamin's spent, smoky Europe and his own grandparents' America: "While my grandparents were dealing with almost absolute emptiness, both social and cultural, Europe was approaching an absolute (and perhaps intolerable) density." McMurtry demonstrates a confidence almost bordering on naivet� in the way he appropriates the great thinking of Europe and applies it to his own history. He apologizes neither to the highfalutin Europeans nor to the down-home Americans, but makes them lie down together any way he sees fit. This brio makes <i>Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen</i> a thrilling read. <p> McMurtry's book-length essay loops outward from Archer City to encompass a polemic against computers, a foray into the world of book collecting, a family biography, an account of his soul-loss after heart surgery, and finally an elegy for the cowboy. This last lament casts a shadow back over what we've read. Not just over this book, but over McMurtry's whole body of work. A man who's lived his whole life in print gives us a glimpse of what has fed him, and, strangely, it's loss. "Because of when and where I grew up, on the Great Plains just as the herding tradition was beginning to lose its vitality, I have been interested all my life in vanishing breeds." The master of storytelling is finally revealed as a master of melancholy. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.</p><h2>The Ghost: A Novel</h2><p>With a wife he loves and an exciting London-based career, architect Charles Waterston's life seems in perfect balance. Nothing in his comfortable existence prepares him for the sudden end to his ten-year marriage&#x2014;or his unwanted transfer to his firm's New York office. With nothing left to lose, Charlie takes a leave of absence from his job to drive through New England, hoping to make peace with himself.<br><br> Christmas is approaching when Charlie leaves New York, heading to Vermont to ski. But a sudden, blinding snowstorm strands him in a small Massachusetts town. There, as if by chance, Charlie meets an elderly widow who offers to rent him her most precious possession: a remote, exquisite lakeside chateau. Hidden deep in the woods, it once belonged to a woman who lived and died there two centuries before. Her name was Sarah Ferguson. And from the moment Charlie sets foot inside the chateau's graceful depths, he feels her presence, and longs to know more about the life she led.<br><br> It is Christmas Eve when Charlie first glimpses her, a beautiful young woman with jet black hair. He thinks it is a neighbor playing a joke on him, until he finds her diaries hidden away in an old trunk. As he begins to turn the brittle, dusty pages, Sarah Ferguson comes alive. Intrigued and unafraid, Charlie immerses himself in the diaries, eager to learn more about the woman for whom the house was built. Sarah's first entry is dated 1789, the year she arrived in America. Without self-pity or sentiment, she writes of her harrowing journey from her native England, having fled the brutality of her aristocratic husband. Settling in Massachusetts, Sarah finds an unfamiliar land seething with the turbulence of the Indian wars. Determined to start a new life in the vast new world, Sarah finds freedom&#x2014;and danger&#x2014;as she builds her home in the wilderness and meets a man who will transform her life. His name is Fran�ois de Pellerin, a French nobleman adopted by Indians and drawn into the battle for the growing nation. Their fateful union is a testament to a love so powerful it reaches across the centuries. And for Charlie Waterston, caught between Sarah's world and his own, their story is a gift&#x2014;one that gives him the courage to let go of his past, and the freedom to grasp a future that is right before his eyes.</p><p>Architect Charles Waterston has a job he loves, a charming and beautiful wife, and an idyllic life in London. But when everything comes crashing down around him--his wife leaving him for another man and his sudden transfer back to the New York home office--Charles takes a well-deserved ski vacation in Vermont. When an unexpected snowstorm strands Charles in a small town, he takes refuge in a small bed-and-breakfast. The proprietor, an elderly widow, also owns a family home in the woods, which Charles decides to rent. Soon after moving in, Charles senses a ghostly presence. While investigating in the attic one day, Charles discovers the diary of Sarah Ferguson, who left her abusive husband in England for a better life in the New World. Charles soon finds himself drawn to Sarah, and he even visits the local historical society in an attempt to learn more about her. There he meets lovely, timid Francesca Vironnet, the historical society curator and librarian, who has fled France with her young daughter. Through Sarah's journals and Francesca's kindness, Charles is able to heal his heart and learn to love again. Complete with Steel's trademark poignancy but minus the glitz and glamour so evident in many of her novels, <i>The Ghost</i> is an outstanding read. <i>--Maudeen Wachsmith</i>A small chateau lies hidden in the New England woods. No one has lived there for a hundred years. But it is as pristine and exquisite as if it had been built yesterday, and the incandescent spirit that fills and surrounds it keeps a timeless love alive and gives a shattered man the strength to begin again.<p></p><p>Charles Waterston is sure his life is over at 42. His wife of nine years has fallen in love with another man and brought an abrupt end to their once blissful life together in London. At the same time, Charles's exhilarating career as an innovative international architect is thrown badly off track when his company orders him back to New York to administer the politicized and aesthetically stagnant head office. Without friends or family, unable to regain his footing and move forward, the dazed and emotionally dead architect takes a leave of absence and heads north to his native New England to nurse his wounds.</p><p></p><p>Sarah Ferguson's life ended over 150 years before Charles Waterston's began. Forced into marriage to a vicious aristocrat in 18th century England, the fragile heiress found the strength to flee, leaving everything behind to brave alone the perilous crossing to post-revolutionary America. There, in the wilderness of western Massachusetts, amid soldiers, settlers, and natives living in uneasy truce, she carves out a peaceful place for herself, wanting nothing more. But her life truly begins when she meets Francois de Pellerin, the enigmatic intermediary between the army and the tribes, as dangerous as he is fascinating.</p><p></p><p>Separated by centuries, united by a deathless courage and a magical place, two lives converge in an unforgettable tribute to life and new beginnings in Danielle Steel's spellbinding new novel, <i>The Ghost.</i></p></p><h2>Poured Out: The Spirit of God Empowering the Mission of God</h2><p>The Holy Spirit Cannot Be Contained <p> After centuries of neglect, there is a renewed interest in the Holy Spirit. Many are beginning to realize that the Spirit is not a junior member of the Trinity, tame and shy. <i>Poured Out</i> explains why the church limited the Spirit for so long and how you can come to know the Spirit better and more fully. To become fruitful again to move beyond apathy, defeat, and despair you need to discover a deeper experience of life with God. A key in this recovery is the realization that the Spirit is God's primary missionary who can empower and guide you in God's work in today's world.</p></p><p>LEONARD ALLEN currently serves as Dean of the College of Bible and Ministry at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Tradition says that Our Lady herself laid this cloth on His face before He was wrapped in His shroud for burial.</p> <p>This small veil now known as the <i>Holy Face of Manoppello</i> absorbed the very first new breath of the Risen Christ . . . and at that same instant had imprinted on itself, miraculously, a vivid image of the now-resurrected Jesus.</p> <p>Modern scholars have confirmed that this image corresponds perfectly in all its measurements to the face of the dead Christ on the more famous Shroud of Turin.</p> <p>Unlike the Shroud, however, the Holy Face of Manoppello shows not the grim visage of a dead man with eyes closed, but the lively face of the living Christ, His eyes wide open, piercing us with their gaze.</p> <p>In 2006, Pope Benedict made a pilgrimage to Manoppello to pray before this image. In the decade since then, tens of thousands of other pilgrims have followed in the Pope's footsteps, making the trek to central Italy to meet Jesus face-to-face.</p> <p>Now, thanks to author Paul Badde you can learn of the loss and recovery of this precious relic. Better yet, by means of the dozens of color pictures in this book, you, too, can encounter this miraculous cloth, and finally gaze reverently on the face of the living Christ Himself!</p></p><p><p>Paul Badde is an historian and journalist. He is a former editor of the German newspaper <em>Welt </em>and is currently a Rome correspondent for EWTN.</p><p>God has shown us his face in His Son Jesus.

His presence and ideas rippled through the lives of many prominent leaders and authors, such as John Ortberg, Richard Foster, James Bryan Smith, Paula Huston, and J. P. Moreland. As a result of these relationships and the books he wrote, he fundamentally altered the way tens of thousands of Christians have understood and experienced the spiritual life. Whether great or small, everyone who met Dallas was impressed by his personal attention, his calm confidence, his wisdom, and his profound sense of the spiritual. But he was not always the man who lived on a different plane of reality than so many of the rest of us. He was someone who had to learn to be a husband, a parent, a teacher, a Christ follower. The journey was not an easy one. He absorbed some of the harshest and most unfair blows life can land. His mother died when he was two, and after his father remarried he was exiled from his stepmother&#x2019;s home. Growing up in Depression-era, rural Missouri and educated in a one-room schoolhouse, he knew poverty, deprivation, anxiety, self-doubt, and depression. Though the pews he sat in during his early years were not offering much by way of love and mercy, Dallas, instead of turning away, kept looking for the company of a living, present, and personal God. In Gary W. Moon&#x2019;s candid and inspiring biography, we read how Willard became the person who mentored and partnered with his young pastor, Richard Foster, to inspire some of the most influential books on spirituality of the last generation. We see how his love of learning took him on to Baylor, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Southern California, where he became a beloved professor and one of the most versatile members of the philosophy department. The life of Dallas Willard deserves attention because he became a person who himself experienced authentic transformation of life and character. Dallas Willard not only taught about spiritual disciplines, he became a different person because of them. He became a grounded person, a spiritually alive person as he put them into practice, finding God, as he often said, "at the end of his rope." Here is a life that gives us all hope.</p><p>"I knew Dallas Willard very well. He supervised my dissertation at USC, and upon graduation in 1985, he and Jane seemed to adopt my wife and me as their children. Those who did not know Dallas in person can get a good sense of him from his lectures and writings. But what has been a gnawing omission is the details of his life made available to the public&#x2015;until now. Gary Moon's incredible book <em>Becoming Dallas Willard</em> fills this void and more. It is a first-rate, accurate, honest, and timely biography that is riveting. If you enjoy Dallas's lectures and writings, you need to read this book. I am so thankful to Gary for doing such a careful and painstakingly accurate treatment of the life of the greatest man I ever met." (J. P. Moreland, distinguished professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University; author of Love Your God With all Your Mind)<br><br>"I will treasure this book for the rest of my life because Dallas is truly present in it." (Aaron Preston, associate professor of philosophy, Valparaiso University)<br><br>"This is the best book I've read in a while&#x2015;no exaggeration! I heartily recommend it, but with a warning wrapped in a prayer: get ready to weep, both in empathy for your friend's suffering and in gratitude for the beautiful life God fashioned through it. The eyes are the window of the soul. Jesus' ancient followers remind us that tears are a gift that cleans the window and allows light to flood the inner self. I'm a little brighter inside for having read this book. My prayer is that our Father may grant you the same gift through these pages." (Daniel Napier, associate professor of theology, Austin Graduate School of Theology)<br><br>"Gary Moon has provided a detailed and intimate depiction of the life of Dallas Willard from his inauspicious beginnings in rural Missouri to his full stature as a philosophical and spiritual thinker of extraordinary intelligence, wisdom, and clarity. In addition to sharing numerous and often heart-rending stories of Dallas's accomplishments, setbacks, and defining experiences, Moon describes the development of Willard's philosophical and religious thought and how it informed, and was informed by, his experiences and actions. What emerges is a well-rounded description of a man whose humility, immense knowledge, commitment to truth, and dedication to the well-being of others left those whose lives he touched forever improved. This is the story of a good man, and we are indebted to Gary Moon for telling it." (Walter Hopp, associate professor of philosophy, Boston University)<br><br>"An exceptional thinker and person whose work and example had a profound influence on so many, Dallas Willard was one of the truly wise men I have known. Gary Moon has written an engaging biography of this philosopher, university professor, and religious thinker who, though an ordinary man of the people, had an extraordinary impact. Moon weaves together the intriguing details of Willard's life, career, ideas, and writings to present an engaging portrait of a philosopher who made a real difference in our understanding of our times, in the lives of his students, for his many readers, and especially for those of us who were fortunate enough to know and work with him." (Brendan Sweetman, department of philosophy, Rockhurst University)<br><br>"The Willard wit and charm appear on nearly every page of this edifying book. Those who knew Dallas well will learn more besides, much of it truly captivating. Gary Moon manages to weave what is anecdotally interesting with what is spiritually compelling, and the whole thing is layered with philosophical richness without which there would be no Dallas Willard. " (R. Douglas Geivett, professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University)<br><br>"I think many people will surprised, encouraged and, yes, pained by Dallas's journey. Still, this is a story that will prolong his important legacy." (Keith Matthews, Azusa Pacific University)<br><br>"Only a man of Gary Moon's astute perspective, intellectual acumen, and spiritual insight could write a biography that accomplishes what most don't. <em>Becoming Dallas Willard</em> combines Dallas's ordinary but compelling life events with a thoughtful grasp of Willard's intellectual journey through spirituality, philosophy, and psychology. This is a rare accomplishment for a biographer, but reading this story has a third benefit beyond knowledge and understanding, which is the ability to change us as readers. Moon's words can move us so deeply that we are not just reading a book, but participating in our own personal transformation. This is an amazing biography for a time such as ours." (Roy M. Carlisle, acquisitions director at Independent Institute)<br><br>"'Dallas was a wonderfully disruptive presence in the world,' may be the best description of the man whose theology has helped all of us understand and experience God and his kingdom in clear, hopeful, and magnificent ways. But Dallas's humanity was, to me, as strong a draw to him as his mind. Gary has managed to capture both the brilliance and the brokenness of Dallas, and I think the weaving of those two threads together is what God used to shape this most unique and winsome of men. This story is ministering to some of the most broken and wounded parts of my soul." (Nancy Ortberg, CEO of Transforming the Bay with Christ)<br><br>"C. S. Lewis once wrote, 'no possible degree of holiness or heroism which has ever been recorded of the greatest saints is beyond what He [God] is determined to produce in every one of us in the end.' In <em>Becoming Dallas Willard</em>, Dr. Gary Moon presents in narrative a developing portrait of a modern saint, a man who both believed and lived the sober truth that real change is possible for all of us. Gratefully, Gary does not write a hagiographic account of one great man's life that awakens desire to become a truly good person but frustrates us with no idea of what to do. I intend to reread what Dallas wrote. His thoughts just might light the path to where I long to go." (Larry Crabb, psychologist, author, When God&#x2019;s Ways Make No Sense)<br><br>"Thank you for this beautiful look at one of my heroes. I remember many events where Dallas was speaking and I always left feeling that I had been in the presence of a true spiritual wise man. I will read this book again and again." (Ken Medema, concert and performing artist)<br><br>"Dallas Willard has had an immense influence on many Christians in our time. His writings would also benefit the lives of many who are not yet familiar with his thought. Gary Moon's winsome telling of Willard's life and thought will deepen the appreciation of those who already know his work and will provide an insightful introduction to those who do not. In this well-written book, Dallas Willard's academic and spiritual legacy lives on." (Tremper Longman III, distinguished scholar of biblical studies, Westmont College)<br><br>"'Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.' This was the life of Dallas Willard. And yet, as nice as it is to know of these rare luminaries, such a light-filled life can seem unreachable for the rest of us. In <em>Becoming Dallas Willard</em>, Gary Moon helps us see that who Dallas became was not always who he was. It is encouraging to know that he, too, had a long way to go. Reading this biography has made Dallas's writings on spiritual formation all the more relevant and believable. If you have found Dallas's other books to be helpful in your spiritual life, reading this biography will round out the story and drive those points home. If you haven't read Dallas's other books, this biography is the perfect place to begin. Chances are that meeting Dallas in the pages of this biography will start you on the journey of a lifetime." (Steve L. Porter, professor of theology and philosophy, Biola University, editor, Journal of Spiritual Formation and Soul Care, PhD student of Dallas Willard (USC 2003))<br><br>"If you are reading this book to learn more about Dallas Willard, you will be richly rewarded with an intimate portrait of a brilliant, complex, wounded, and generous man. Even better, through Dallas you will learn more about Jesus of Nazareth and how to have a life of loving interaction with him here and now. Through faithful research and sensitive interviews, Gary Moon fittingly honors Dallas while supremely exalting Jesus. Dallas would want it no other way." (Sandra D. Wilson, spiritual director, retired family therapist and seminary professor, author of Released from Shame and Into Abba's Arms)<br><br>"The main reason I took with absolute seriousness the disruptive ideas that Dallas taught about God and God's kingdom was that he obviously lived in these realities himself. The good news he shared was credible because of his own overwhelmingly radiant life. Dallas lived in the house of his own proclamation. Now, in this labor of love, Gary Moon has given us a believable glimpse into how Dallas became the person he was. By describing Dallas's slow and gradual journey of inner transformation within the crucible of his own challenging and sometimes painful life circumstances, this biography communicates the wonderful good news that real change is possible for each one of us. I believe that this book will light up a deep and intense longing in many hearts to live more faithfully as apprentices of Christ in the kingdom of God." (Trevor Hudson, Methodist minister in South Africa, senior fellow, Dallas Willard Center and Martin Institute, lecturer, Renovar� Institute for Spiritual Formation)<br><br>"Gary Moon offers a fascinating depiction of the life of Dallas Willard in this wonderful biography. As a psychologist, I have always been interested in exactly how we develop in the ways that we do. <em>Becoming Dallas Willard</em> gives us deep insights into the formation of this man who would become a spiritual light for many Christians. Dallas's searingly difficult childhood produced aching losses that clearly come through these pages. This biography offers a glimpse into its subject's life that honors the realism of Dallas's philosophical identity. Not skipping over the foibles and failures, we see Dallas's early fundamentalist ideas contrasting with his inner experience. We understand the contributions of his revivalist upbringing and its impact on his marriage, parenting, work, and experience with God. Yet through all of the pain, all of the resulting challenges, all of the deep relationships he experienced, Dallas Willard's life shines most with a vibrant joy of being with God. It is an extraordinary book exegeting the life of an extraordinary man." (C. Jeffrey Terrell, dean, College of Education and Human Services, professor of counseling psychology, John Brown University)<br><br>"I only heard Dallas Willard speak once, many years ago. I was in the audience at the invitation of my friend Gary Moon as Dallas gave twelve precisely timed ten-minute talks. As I listened, I was overwhelmed with two things: the insightful truth that Dallas spoke about spiritual formation, and the simple and disarming way in which he spoke it. When I met Dallas after the sessions, I was overwhelmed with two other things: the humility that Dallas exhibited, and the joy that oozed out of him. In this marvelous book, Gary has helped me understand more fully what made Dallas tick. Gary, a master storyteller, provides many deep insights into Dallas's thinking and life for people who 'sit at the grown-up table.' But for those of us who 'sit at the kid&#x2019;s table,' Gary puts the food where we can reach it. This book leads me closer to Jesus, the one who transformed Dallas and reminded him again and again over the years: 'I'm here. I see you. I've got you.'" (Curt Cloninger, storyteller)<br><br>"What a gift it's been to read the biography of Dallas! It feels like getting to know him better and receiving more of God's gifting through him. The depth of thought and reflection and your mastery of not only Dallas's life but also the explanation of concepts from theology and psychology and philosophy are amazing. It's clear, powerful, compelling, and moving both for folks who knew Dallas and many who will meet him through this book." (John Ortberg, pastor, Menlo Church, author, Soul Keeping: Caring for the Most Important Part of You)<br><br>"One of the most astonishing things about Dallas Willard was how his speaking, teaching, and writing seemed so effortless. But, as this official biography so beautifully chronicles, 'Dallas Willard had to become Dallas Willard,' the beloved man whose words and ways have uniquely touched a whole generation. Here, through hard and often heartbreaking times, one can see God structuring Dallas's character and life. This book presents the powerful message that there is hope for each of us, because God's kingdom is here for the taking&#x2015;if we want it." (Greg Jesson, writer and speaker)<br><br>"Years ago, it was suggested to me that a great way to learn key teachings from St. Augustine would be to read a biography, where the sweeping yet nuanced ideas he wrote about could be understood in the context of the story&#x2015;his life&#x2015;from which they emerged. It helped! I find the same experience reading Gary Moon's comprehensive, instructive, and intimate biography of Dallas Willard. World-changing ideas and refreshing, freeing insights are set in the context of the tragically beautiful story&#x2015;Dallas's life&#x2015;from which they emerged. Whether you are familiar with Dallas's teaching or just beginning a journey of discovery, you will come to understand and appreciate more deeply the arc of his reason, passion, humility, and service." (Mindy Caliguire, author, speaker, founder of Soul Care)<br><br>"The web of Dallas Willard's life is a highly complex, wondrous, and redemptive story woven from the strands of God's providence: family, friends, colleagues, events, institutions, ministry, teaching, writing, choices, pain, grief, healing, deep faith, and love. How difficult and maybe all but impossible task it is for a biographer to untangle and explain the story of any image-bearer's life, much less a giant in the land such as Dallas Willard. But Gary Moon does this in a kind, discerning, and wise manner. We can now know Dallas Willard much better&#x2015;and be enriched and encouraged in the knowing&#x2015;because his close friend Gary Moon has researched and written so clearly." (Christopher Hall, president, Renovar�)<br><br>"You&#x2019;ll enjoy the intriguing story behind a man who lived in the kingdom of God here and now. Drawn skillfully from a variety of resources, <em>Becoming Dallas Willard</em> shows us how Dallas thought carefully, lived authentically, and loved well." (Jan Johnson, coauthor with Dallas Willard of Renovation of the Heart in Daily Practice, Hearing God Through the Year, and Study Guide to the Divine Conspiracy)<br><br>"Gary Moon has put his heart and soul into this project&#x2015;researching, writing, and carefully crafting what has become a quite remarkable book. . . . The result is a fascinating perspective on a big man who will continue to cast a long shadow over the church and its people for many years to come."

Ware, Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky<br><br>The story of the life of Ann Judson as told by Sharon James was one of the most inspiring, convicting and challenging stories I have ever read. It was given to me as I was struggling with the cost of leaving all, family, friends, home, and coming to an unknown, strange, and difficult place. . . . [Ann Judson s story] inspired and convinced me that no cost is too great, and no price too high for the privilege of taking the honours of His Name to<br>those who have never known or heard. --Serving long-term missionary in the Far East<br><br>In a venerable line of biographies of Ann Judson, this fresh re- telling of Ann s story provides a marvellous biographical resource.

Smith, S.T.D., Censor Librorum and Dennis J. Sullivan, Vicar General, Archdiocese of New York</i><i>Millions of books have been sold, teaching adults the practice of centering prayer. Finally, a guide for children!</i><br> <br> <br> Centering prayer is a way of opening our whole being to God, beyond thoughts, words and emotions. It is simple and practical&#x2014;a way of preparing heart and mind to receive the gift of intimate relationship with God. Jesus said, &#x201c;When you pray, go to your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&#x201d; (Matthew 6:6) <br> &nbsp;<br> Frank Jelenek shows young children just how to do that. The first guide to a contemplative prayer practice for children, <i>Journey to the Heart</i> both instructs and inspires. Many parents and teachers will learn from this colorful treasure of a book, as well! Until now, parents and teachers had no resource available to introduce children to the joys of communicating with God in this special, intimate way. <br> &nbsp;<br> This loving book makes it easy for children to share in the spiritual nourishment of centering prayer through age-appropriate illustrations and text that provides clear directions and encouragement in simple, fun language. Ideal for ages 3 &#x2013; 10.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Frank X. Jelenek is a member of Thomas Keating's Contemplative Outreach, dedicated to teaching and practicing centering prayer to people of all ages. He works for Scholastic Book Fairs and shares his passion for books and prayer with his twenty nieces and nephews. <p>Ann Boyajian is also the illustrator of Samantha's Friendship Fun (in the American Girls(tm) series), and many other books.</p>Contemplative prayer would seem to be a discipline more suited to adults than children, but this easily understandable book offers a framework that even primary-schoolers can work within. The book begins by introducing the concept of the soul explaining that a journey to the deepest part of the heart is time to commune with God and Jesus. First, the book suggests choosing a secret word or phrase such as <i>faith, Father, Jesus, </i>or <i>Holy Spirit.</i>Then, it recommends sitting silently, eyes closed, feet on the floor; if others are participating, it suggests placing chairs in a prayer circle. The next step involves saying the secret word silently while resting within. When other thoughts intrude, participants can let them float away during the six moments of silence they are to spend with God. The session ends with the Our Father. The gentle text encourages children, and the attractive, simple pictures, often depicting people at prayer, are done in warm, gentle colors. An unusual, peaceful offering.

The Malleus Maleficarum (Latin for &#34;The Hammer of Witches&#34;) is a famous treatise on witches, written in 1486 by Heinrich Kramer, an Inquisitor of the Catholic Church, and was first published in Germany in 1487. Jacob Sprenger is also often attributed as an author. The main purpose of the Malleus was to attempt to systematically refute arguments claiming that witchcraft does not exist, discredit those who expressed skepticism about its reality, to claim that witches were more often women than men, and to educate magistrates on the procedures that could find them out and convict them. This edition of Malleus Maleficarum is here translated into English for the first time. It contains a note upon the bibliography of the Malleus Maleficarum and includes bibliographical references. Translated, with introductions, bibliography and notes by Montague Summers.</p><p></p><h2>90s Bitch: Media, Culture, and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality</h2><p><p>To understand how we got here, we have to&nbsp;rewind the VHS tape. <em>90s Bitch</em> tells the real story of women and girls in the 1990s, exploring how they were maligned by the media, vilified by popular culture, and objectified in the marketplace. Trailblazing women like Hillary Clinton, Anita Hill, Marcia Clark, and Roseanne Barr were undermined. Newsmakers like Monica Lewinsky, Tonya Harding, and Lorena Bobbitt were shamed and misunderstood. The advent of the 24-hour news cycle reinforced society's deeply entrenched sexism. Meanwhile, marketers hijacked feminism and poisoned girlhood for a generation of young women. </p><p>Today, there are echoes of 90s &#x201c;bitchification&#x201d; nearly everywhere we look. To understand why, we must revisit and interrogate the 1990s&#x2014;a decade in which female empowerment was twisted into objectification, exploitation, and subjugation. </p><p>Yarrow&#x2019;s thoughtful, juicy, and timely examination is a must-read for anyone trying to understand 21st century sexism and end it for the next generation. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Allison Yarrow</strong>&nbsp;is an award-winning journalist and National Magazine Award finalist whose work has appeared in the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>,&nbsp;the<em> Washington Post</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vox, </em>and many others<em>.</em>&nbsp;She was a 2017 TED resident and is a 2018 grantee of the International Women&#x2019;s Media Foundation. She produced the&nbsp;<em>Vice&nbsp;</em>documentary &#x201c;Misconception,&#x201d; and has appeared on the&nbsp;<em>Today</em>&nbsp;show, MSNBC, NPR and more. Allison was raised in Macon, Georgia and lives in Brooklyn, New York. </p>&#x201c;Allison Yarrow is a feminist and a muckraker in the tradition of Betty Friedan, Naomi Klein, and bell hooks. Her enthralling new book, 90s Bitch, takes a long overdue sledgehammer (and, when needed, a scalpel) to the misogynistic myths that cloud our view of that troubling decade. Like all great cultural historians, she examines every sordid cranny of our culture&#x2014;its sexual mores, its pop culture and rampant consumerism&#x2014;so as to lay bare the marching orders issued by the patriarchy: that women should shut up and put out, sell out, sell themselves short, and most of all obey. Yarrow&#x2019;s prose is brilliant, her insights are razor-sharp, and her moral aim is essential. If America is ever going to recover from the Trumpian tailspin wrought by masculine insecurity, we need feminists like Allison Yarrow keeping us all honest.&#x201d; (Steve Almond, author of <em>Bad Stories: What the Hell Just Happened to Our Country</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;90s Bitch is a book we need right now. Allsion Yarrow&nbsp;takes the full measure of misogyny in America -- then and now -- and she KO&#x2019;s it like the champion she is. This is a trilling read, smart and lyrical and -- above all -- necessary.&nbsp; The book&nbsp;would be on my recommended&nbsp;reading-list at any time, but during the Trump era it should be mandatory.&nbsp;&#x201d; (Darin Strauss, NBCC-winning author of <em>Half A Life</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Brava for this ambitious, confident, and brilliantly original explication de Bitch.&#x201d; (Wednesday Martin, #1 New York Times best-selling author of <em>Primates of Park Avenue</em>)<br><br>&#x201c;Amidst the revelations of #MeToo, it&#x2019;s sometimes easy to forget that we&#x2019;re in the midst of a feminist backlash.

These letters are deeply enmeshed in a web of meaning both cultural and spiritual, lending power and weight to their symbolism. With two decades of experience with the ogam and over thirty years of working with divination, Erynn offers insights into the many profound meanings hidden in the ogam letters and their lore. She explains each letter in context and shows how to expand the system in new and innovative ways while acknowledging and maintaining respect for ogam&#39;s traditional language and culture. In this book, you will find ways to use the ogam for divination, ideas on incorporating ogam into ritual, discussions of how ogam relates to Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, and instructions for creating your own set of ogam feda or letters for your personal use.</p><p>Laurie is a Student of the Irish Celts, and Has Been a Priestess of Their Ancient Deities for Nearly a Decade. a Dedicated Modern Addict, She Can Often Be Found Online Talking about Celts.</p><h2>Tight</h2><p><b><b>Tight: Lately, Bryan's been feeling it in all kinds of ways . . .</b></b><br><br>Bryan knows what's tight for him--reading comics, drawing superheroes, and hanging out with no drama.

She&#x2019;s cool with her boss and coworkers, so they&#x2019;re cool with me and my sister, Ava, being at Ma&#x2019;s job after school.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, Ava chills for minutes. Me? Hours. I don&#x2019;t know why Ava doesn&#x2019;t hang longer. Maybe she&#x2019;s too busy with her ninth-grade life. But me? I like doing office things, like Ma: reading, being quiet, and chilling for forever. For example, about a month back, I found this empty spot at Ma&#x2019;s job and asked her if I could use it as my pretend-office. She asked her boss and she told Ma, &#x201c;Sure. We also have a spare desk-chair and some other supplies Bryan can use.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, right now, I&#x2019;m doing homework in my office, but this kid named Mike is at Ma&#x2019;s desk and I&#x2019;m distracted spying on him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;s a year older than me and about two inches taller. He rocks a sweater like mine, but his kicks are newer and more popular. He has hair like me, Afro-type if we grew it out. Mine&#x2019;s grown out a little since I need a cut. He just got one.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he&#x2019;s alone, but I&#x2019;ve seen him with his mom here, two or three times.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#x2019;t think twice about Mike at first because a lot of kids and their parents come through here. Then I saw him at my school, hanging with seventh graders. He didn&#x2019;t do his sixth grade in my school. So, why&#x2019;d he transfer for his seventh grade? I asked Ma, and she said his family was in the Bronx and she helped them get an apartment here in Brooklyn in our projects.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In school, me and Mike nod what&#x2019;s up but don&#x2019;t hang. I see him around the neighborhood too and at the handball courts near us. Then the other day I saw him talking to my pops. I didn&#x2019;t get why Pa was so friendly to him. And I don&#x2019;t get why Mike is here now, talking to Ma.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I squint at them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did Mike just call Ma &#x2018;Ma&#x2019;?&#x201d; I ask Ava, who is in my office looking at my homework on my clipboard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava stares from the clipboard at him and shrugs. &#x201c;Who cares? Almost anyone younger than her calls her Ma.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s true. Ma helps lots of people and they love her. But I don&#x2019;t like this kid Mike calling her Ma right now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask Ava, &#x201c;Why&#x2019;s he playing her so close?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava goes back to reading the clipboard, but I can&#x2019;t look away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike stares at Ma like she&#x2019;s his mom for real and gives her a hug.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo! He better let go of my moms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava interrupts me and points at different spots on my clipboard. &#x201c;You spelled some stuff wrong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What? Where?&#x201d; Nothing should be wrong because I checked it twice like Ma says to do. I look where she points.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh! She&#x2019;s right. I hate when she&#x2019;s right.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grab a pencil, take the clipboard, and fix my mistakes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time I look up again, Mike&#x2019;s about to leave. He yells, &#x201c;Bye, Ma!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn to Ava. &#x201c;He just called her Ma again!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rolls her eyes. &#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s probably her real son. Unlike you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here she goes again, cracking that stupid joke she&#x2019;s been cracking since I was in day care, telling me Ma and Pa found me in a trash can.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then, I believed her since me and Ava have different complexions. Hers is chocolate brown. I&#x2019;m a lighter caramel.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time she said it, I ran to Ma and she showed me our birth certificates. Ava got punished but she never stopped joking I wasn&#x2019;t her brother&#x2014;like right now&#x2014;and for some reason it still bothers me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I wish Mike was my real brother,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s no momma&#x2019;s boy like you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My whole head burns like I have a fever. I want to cut on her so hard. But only weak disses come to mind. I finally growl, &#x201c;Big Head.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oooh, Big Head. Ouch. I can&#x2019;t wait until Mike comes to eat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Eat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What you think? He calls Ma Ma and he won&#x2019;t come eat soon? You know anyone who calls Ma Ma ends up eating with us. You saw how she hugged him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ma sneaks up on us. &#x201c;What is going on with you two?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shut up.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You both were going at it. Now you&#x2019;re quiet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bryan&#x2019;s mad because you hugged Mike.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ma makes a face like I&#x2019;m her baby and I have nothing to worry about. &#x201c;Come here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go over and she hugs me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about Mike. You&#x2019;ll see tomorrow night. He&#x2019;s coming for dinner.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; <br><b> <br>Chapter 2</b><br><br>When I get back from school the next day, Ma tries handing me what looks like a grocery list. I U-turn to bounce.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bryan,&#x201d; she calls me back. &#x201c;Here. I need you to go to Hector&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sigh, turn around, and take her grocery list as thoughts fly through my head.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope there&#x2019;s no note for the bodega&#x2019;s owner.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope there&#x2019;s no note for the bodega&#x2019;s owner.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh! There&#x2019;s a note for him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I have to get groceries with a note and not real money? I wish I had brothers to get groceries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I do have brothers. Before Ma, Pa had three sons from another woman. But I don&#x2019;t even know what they look like. I used to imagine them. I pictured them stopping bullies from bullying me. I pictured them giving me money when I wanted candy. I pictured them teaching me boy stuff Pa didn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I&#x2019;ve stopped imagining them. They&#x2019;re not coming to Brooklyn for me, and they probably don&#x2019;t even know about me. Supposedly, they&#x2019;re grown and live in Philly or somewhere.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pa probably doesn&#x2019;t even know what his sons look like either. Ma says Pa left them when they were like nine or ten and he hasn&#x2019;t seen them since. Whatevs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I have to go get groceries. Not Ava. Not imaginary brothers. Me. And I hate it.<br> ***<br> I look at Ma&#x2019;s shopping list. &#x201c;Can I add chocolate powder?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sighs. &#x201c;Bryan, we&#x2019;re just getting what we need.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I need chocolate milk,&#x201d; I say. I look at the list again. &#x201c;Okay, how about grapes? We need them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We have.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;They so shriveled,&#x201d; I joke, &#x201c;they raisins now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ma&#x2019;s in a serious mood. &#x201c;Money is tight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to say, If money is tight and we have to buy food on credit, why you inviting Mike to dinner?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I just take the list and head for the elevator. When it shows up, there&#x2019;s a puddle of piss in it. Instead of someone cleaning it up, it looks like heads did what they usually do&#x2014;keep trashing it. Junk-food wrappers and cigarette butts float on the puddle that stinks ammonia-strong.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take the stairs.<br> ***<br> Pa&#x2019;s friends hang out on the corner near the bodega.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His friend Pito lowers his sunglasses and waves when he sees me. Pito could pass for that basketball player Stephen Curry and always rocks skintight T-shirts that show off his abs, no matter how cold it gets outside.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bunch of other familiar faces spot me and their faces flip from hard to hi, but not much else flips. Loud Spanish music thumps. Teens who rock the most dip gear sit on milk crates. Some of Pa&#x2019;s real old&#x2014;viejo&#x2014;friends sit at a table and play dominoes and beef about the last move made.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Pa and his homeboys&#x2019; spot. I only come by when I&#x2019;m on my way to the bodega or the arcade next door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ava says I don&#x2019;t like to hang here because I&#x2019;m soft. That&#x2019;s why she calls me a momma&#x2019;s boy. I&#x2019;m not a momma&#x2019;s boy, but I am like Ma since she got me used to being by myself, the way she keeps to herself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Focus on school,&#x201d; Ma always tells me. &#x201c;There will be friends later. The wrong friends bring drama, and I don&#x2019;t want them rubbing off on you.&#x201d; Anyway, with all that advice, I wonder why she&#x2019;s letting Mike come over.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicholas, this black older man with dark skin and all-white hair like Magneto from the X-Men, puts his hand on my shoulder and nods at a crate. &#x201c;Sit! Sit!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No thanks,&#x201d; I tell Nicholas real kind. &#x201c;Ma and Pa want me back with the food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicholas and Pa&#x2019;s friends circle me, smiling. Some are a bit bent with that same smell Pa has when he drinks. But the look in their eyes is the same: love. I know they have my back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When me and Pa are here, he tells them, &#x201c;Look out for my son,&#x201d; and they swear they&#x2019;d body anyone who messes with me. Once, when Pa told Pito to look out for me, Pito lifted his fist, showed Pa his knuckles, and told him, &#x201c;Joe, you kidding me? Someone messes with him and they get this.&#x201d; Pa lifted his fist too, and they winked, pumping fists like boxers before a boxing match.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe Pito and Nicholas and all of Pa&#x2019;s friends when they say they&#x2019;ll do whatevs for me. Out here, you need heads who got your back and it feels good that they got mine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go in the store.<br> ***<br> &#x201c;Bryan!&#x201d; Hector smiles at me while humming along to a Marc Anthony song playing loud from behind the counter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hand him Ma&#x2019;s shopping list. He stops humming, reads it, and bites his lip. &#x201c;Your father hasn&#x2019;t paid his last bill.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look away, wishing I wasn&#x2019;t here.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hector sighs and slides Ma&#x2019;s list on the counter back to me. &#x201c;Go ahead. Tell him I&#x2019;ll add this to his old bill.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grab it, then a handbasket, and walk in the Goya aisle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I start getting stuff from shelves, and when I get to the bread, Hector&#x2019;s tiger-striped cat chills on top of a loaf.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to tell Hector, &#x201c;Mercedes is smushing the bread.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&#x2019;t though. Hector might flip and say, &#x201c;My cat can do what she wants. You don&#x2019;t even have money. Be happy I let you get food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk up to Mercedes and the bread.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hisses.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to grab a not-smushed bread, and Mercedes swats me mad fast!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo! Her eyes look like she says, Get out my store with your broke butt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally have everything, I go to the counter. Hector checks if the list matches what I got. I can&#x2019;t have nothing extra.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stare back at the chocolate powder we can&#x2019;t afford to buy. Chocolate milk tastes so good.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right then, this girl Melanie from my school comes in and watches as Hector bags my stuff and hands me a Post-it. &#x201c;This is how much your father owes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dang! Why&#x2019;d he have to mention us owing money? I nervous-smile at Melanie, and just like I thought, she eyes me all in my sauce and trying to know the flavor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&#x2019;s for her to figure out? I&#x2019;m a broke joke.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo! I wish I could explode magician smoke in front of me and&#x2014;poof&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be gone and not here, all embarrassed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nod at Hector. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tell Joe I say hi.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside his store, I look above everyone&#x2019;s head&#x2014;above all the laughs, the arguing, and the music.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look toward Manhattan, and I wish things could be different.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish my family had more money.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish that girl didn&#x2019;t have to see me be broke.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had a brother for real.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I wasn&#x2019;t in my feelings.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I didn&#x2019;t care so much.</p><h2>On Becoming a Novelist</h2><p><p><strong>"One of the greatest creative writing teachers we've ever had." &#x2015;Frederick Busch</strong></p><em>On Becoming a Novelist</em> contains the wisdom accumulated during John Gardner's distinguished twenty-year career as a fiction writer and creative writing teacher. With elegance, humor, and sophistication, Gardner describes the life of a working novelist; warns what needs to be guarded against, both from within the writer and from without; and predicts what the writer can reasonably expect and what, in general, he or she cannot. "For a certain kind of person," Gardner writes, "nothing is more joyful or satisfying than the life of a novelist." But no other vocation, he is quick to add, is so fraught with professional and spiritual difficulties. Whether discussing the supposed value of writer's workshops, explaining the role of the novelist's agent and editor, or railing against the seductive fruits of literary elitism, <em>On Becoming a Novelist</em> is an indispensable, life-affirming handbook for anyone authentically called to the profession. "A miraculously detailed account of the creative process."&#x2015;Anne Tyler, <em>Baltimore Sun</em></p><p>Picture the poor, young, serious-fiction writer. He toils alone at a pace not so different from that of Lincoln Tunnel traffic at rush hour in New York. His spouse has a "real" job, or perhaps he has a trust fund. His college friends are cashing in on their dot-coms and wondering if he's ever going to join the real world. He is not hell-bent on publication; he is trying to write "serious, honest fiction, the kind of novel that readers will find they enjoy reading more than once, the kind of fiction likely to survive." He's likely to have no idea whether he's succeeding. Nobody understands him.<p> Well, almost nobody. John Gardner understands him. Gardner's sympathetic <i>On Becoming a Novelist</i> is the novelist's ultimate comfort food--better than macaroni and cheese, better than chocolate. Gardner, a fiction writer himself (<i>Grendel</i>), knows in his bones the desperate questioning of a writer who's not sure he's up to the task. He recognizes the validation that comes with being published, just as he believes that "for a true novel there is generally no substitute for slow, slow baking." Gardner also has strong feelings about what kinds of workshops help (and whom they help), and what kinds hinder. But a full half of Gardner's book is devoted to an exploration of the writer's nature. The storyteller's intelligence, he says, "is composed of several qualities, most of which, in normal people, are signs of either immaturity or incivility." In addition, a writer needs "verbal sensitivity, accuracy of eye," and "an almost demonic compulsiveness." But wait--there's more. A writer needs to be driven, and to be driven, he says insightfully, "a psychological wound is helpful." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>John Gardner was the best-selling author of more than 25 books and taught creative writing at many universities, among them Chico State, Bennington College, and SUNY-Binghamton. His novels Grendel, The Sunlight Dialogues, and October Light are regarded as modern classics. He was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1982 at the age of 49.</p><h2>The American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry</h2><p><i>The American Slave Coast</i> tells the horrific story of how the slavery business in the United States made the reproductive labor of &#x201c;breeding women&#x201d; essential to the expansion of the nation. The book shows how slaves&#x2019; children, and their children&#x2019;s children, were human savings accounts that were the basis of money and credit. This was so deeply embedded in the economy of the slave states that it could only be decommissioned by Emancipation, achieved through the bloodiest war in the history of the United States.<i> The American Slave Coast</i> is an alternative history of the United States that presents the slavery business, as well as familiar historical figures and events, in a revealing new light.</p><p><p><b>Ned Sublette</b> is the author of <i>Cuba and Its Music</i>, <i>The World that Made New Orleans</i>, and <i>The Year Before the Flood</i>. <b>Constance Sublette</b>&nbsp; published, as Constance Ash, the novels <i>The Horsegirl</i>, <i>The Stalking Horse</i>, and <i>The Stallion Queen</i>, and edited an anthology of science fiction.

Abolitionists answered that it was the ugliest of businesses. For too long historians tried to split the difference but really took a side by calling it &#x2018;the South,&#x2019; a society or a culture.&nbsp;Drawing on the most recent scholarship, Ned and Constance Sublette&nbsp;get it right: it was an industry, a particular market-tested brand with varieties adapted to its changing&nbsp;times and places. And like all industries it had a politics, too, that affected producers, consumers, and the workers who, in this peculiar case,&nbsp;were&nbsp;not only labor but also&nbsp;capital and, in the bodies of their children,&nbsp;product.

In&nbsp;<i>The American Slave Coast</i>, the Sublettes have painstakingly provided readers with both a compelling narrative and a well-documented and factual rendering.

On returning to the States she published Julia Child's <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i>. The rest is publishing and gastronomic history. A new world now opened up to Jones as she discovered, with her husband Evan, the delights of American food, publishing some of the premier culinary luminaries of the twentieth century: from Julia Child, James Beard, and M.F.K. Fisher to Claudia Roden, Edna Lewis, and Lidia Bastianich. Here also are fifty of Jones's favorite recipes collected over a lifetime of cooking-each with its own story and special tips. <i>The Tenth Muse</i> is an absolutely charming memoir by a woman who was present at the creation of the American food revolution and played a pivotal role in shaping it.</p><p><b>Judith Jones</b> is Senior Editor and Vice President at Alfred A. Knopf. She joined the company in 1957 as an editor working primarily on translations of French writers such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. She had worked before that for Doubleday, first in New York and then in Paris, where she was responsible for reading and recommending <i>The Diary of Anne Frank. </i>In addition to her literary authors, she has been particularly interested in developing a list of first-rate cookbook writers; her authors have included Julia Child (Judith published Julia's first book and was her editor ever after), Lidia Bastianich, James Beard, Marion Cunningham, Rosie Daley, Marcella Hazan, Madhur Jaffrey, Edna Lewis, Scott Peacock, Joan Nathan, Jacques P�pin, Claudia Roden, and Nina Simonds. She is the coauthor with Evan Jones (her late husband) of two books: <i>The Book of Bread: Knead It, Punch It, Bake It! </i>(for children); and <i>The Book of New New England Cookery</i>. She also collaborated with Angus Cameron on <i>The L.L. Bean Game and Fish Cookbook</i>. Recently, she has contributed to <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Saveur</i>, and <i>Gourmet </i>magazines. In 2006, she was awarded the James Beard Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.<b>Bread Pudding</b><br>SERVES: 4 to 6<br><br>At a country inn in Wales, I had one of those taste-memory moments that made me realize how a simple pudding of eggs, bread, and milk could in a flash call up a flood of memory so acute that for an instant I was right back in childhood. The baked dish was brought in, wrapped in a white linen napkin, the way Edie would have served it, and as it was spooned onto the plate I had my first whiff. Then, when I took a taste, the hot raisins bursting in my mouth, the sensation was so powerful that the tears rolled down my cheeks (adding a little salty flavor).<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> I discovered from Edna Lewis how much better crushed sugar cubes are than plain granulated sugar as a topping. They're particularly good if you've stored them in a jar with a vanilla bean. Bread pudding is best warm, but it can be very good cold, too.

I steeled myself for something weighty, perhaps about whether I believed in heaven and hell. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Then she looked at me and asked: &#x201c;Tell me, Judith, do you really like garlic?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t lie. Yes, I admitted, I adored garlic. She looked so crestfallen at that moment that I was sure she felt a sense of finality about the wayward path her younger daughter had taken. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>To her, garlic represented everything alien and vulgar. It smelled bad, and people who handled it or ate it smelled bad. Moreover, it covered up the natural flavor of honest food&#x2014;and that was suspect. Those French chefs, for instance, why did they have to put a sauce on everything, anyway? No doubt to disguise the taste because what was underneath wasn&#x2019;t very fresh to begin with. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>In my mother&#x2019;s house we were always being told to get rid of the smells, to make sure that the kitchen door was shut, that the windows were open. Not only was garlic banned, onions were permitted only when a lamb stew was being prepared, for which two or three well-boiled small white onions per person were deemed appropriate. That&#x2019;s all that were purchased; Mother didn&#x2019;t want our cook, Edie Price, sneaking a little chopped onion into her meatloaf. And heaven forbid that indigestible, raw pieces might find their way into a tuna-fish sandwich. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Still, I have to admit that the unadulterated English-style food I grew up on had its merits. I always loved our Sunday dinner prime rib roast with Yorkshire pudding, which my British grandfather, whenever he was present, would carve at the table, deftly cutting thin&#x2014;too thin, I always thought&#x2014;rosy slices. My father, Charles Bailey, who was called Monty because he grew up in Montpelier, Vermont, somehow never lost the mischievous charm of a small-town boy after he had to settle in New York City. When he married into the Hedley family, he made a point of carving clumsy, thick slices, and so was banished as the family carver. My mother took over. I can still see her standing at the head of the table honing her knife on a sharpening steel, and I would always try to sneak a nibble from the platter when she wasn&#x2019;t looking. The knuckle-bone meat on a lamb roast was irresistible. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I am grateful, too, that those organ meats that people spurn today often graced our table: liver and bacon, beefsteak and kidney pie, breaded sweetbreads&#x2014;I lapped them up and still find all forms of innards an earthy delight. Frugality was considered a virtue. One never let things go to waste, so our cook, Edie, learned to turn leftovers into wonderful dishes: crispy croquettes with creamy lamb, ham, or chicken inside; shepherd&#x2019;s pie of ground-up leftover lamb with a mashed-potato topping; minced meats in cream on toast; stuffed vegetables. We also had a meatless night once a week, either for the sake of economy or because it was good for us to forgo the pleasure of flesh, I&#x2019;m not sure. For quite a few years after I graduated from the nursery table to the grown-up dinner table, I thought when we were served breaded and fried eggplant or broiled mushrooms that they were a form of meat. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t dare ask, because one wasn&#x2019;t supposed to talk about food at the table (it was considered crude, like talking about sex). And if we indulged in appreciative sounds like &#x201c;yum-yum,&#x201d; we just might be sent from the table. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Nor could we make disparaging remarks if something displeased us. I remember how endlessly long the winter seemed when all that Mr. Volpe, our Italian fruit-and-vegetable vendor on the corner, could produce was overgrown root vegetables, sprouts and cabbage, and tired potatoes. Then what greens we could get were cooked so long that an unappetizing cabbagy smell permeated the air, and it was hard to get down our due portion. But we weren&#x2019;t allowed to say a word. It did take me some time, though, to appreciate parsnips and broccoli. When, finally, spring broke through and we tasted our first asparagus, even though slightly overcooked, it was a treat worth waiting for. And we were allowed to pick up the spears with our fingers. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t remember ever going shopping with my mother in the city to pick out the first vegetables and fruits of the season. Food shopping was invariably done by phone, as though to keep a distance from the things of the earth. In the summer, though, a truck with fresh farm produce would do a tour of the lake in Vermont where we had our summer cottage, and it was fun to go out and greet the local farmer and get a look at what he had just pulled from the soil. Every week the butcher&#x2019;s truck would stop by, and I once persuaded him to let me ride with him as he made his rounds. I was impressed with the way he wielded his knife and would lop off a slab of meat which, when he put it on the scales, would always come within an ounce of what the customer had ordered. The back of the truck was chilled only by a block of ice, and as the warmth of the summer day penetrated, the smell of raw meat became tantalizingly strong. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Meat was such an important part of everyone&#x2019;s diet that when we were plunged into World War II and were suddenly confronted with rationing, there was a sense of deprivation. I was away at college in Bennington, Vermont, in those years, and we had a huge Victory Garden in which all had to participate. I remember how the erudite critic Kenneth Burke insisted that he conduct his class out in the burgeoning fields, because he felt that having our feet planted firmly in the soil and nurturing the fruits of the earth would encourage our minds to soar. We were also asked to volunteer for poultry duty, and I felt very virtuous beheading and plucking and eviscerating chickens by the dozens&#x2014;all in expectation of a good dinner, of course. Bennington was known for its superior food, and I&#x2019;m not ashamed to admit that, after sampling the fare at a number of sister colleges, I just may have chosen Bennington because I liked to eat well. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, back home in New York, meat was scarce. My parents had acquired a Kerry blue terrier, no doubt to fill the gap left by their last daughter&#x2019;s going off to college, and they were finding it so hard to get enough meat to feed this hungry animal that they finally gave him to Albert, the butcher. Or so the story goes. The other version is that my mischievous father, now that there were no children around, had to take the dog out every night for what seemed increasingly long walks. Now, in those days, Third Avenue in the East Sixties was still a thoroughly Irish neighborhood; the el rattled through, and there was a pub on every corner. During the daytime, when my mother walked the dog, she began to notice how he would stop at several of the nearby pubs and pull her in, tail wagging in happy anticipation of a doggy treat. Then it dawned on her why those evening walks were taking Monty so long. She quickly made an arrangement with the butcher. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>But back to those earlier childhood memories at the table. Above all, we always ate what was put in front of us, especially if we wanted dessert. To me those homemade desserts of British ancestry were the crowning glory of the meal, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have missed them for anything. I still feel nostalgic for the warm chocolate steamed pudding with foamy sauce, the bread pudding with its crusty top and raisins bursting inside, the apple brown Betty made with good tart country apples, the floating island with its peaks of egg white swimming in a sea of yellow custard. Then, when summer came, there were the summer puddings, a bread-lined mold steeped in just-cooked blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries as each came in season, pressed, chilled, and unmolded, with thick unpasteurized cream poured over each serving. Edie had some specialties of her own, such as individual warm nut-and-date cakes, and meringues (which we called kisses) topped with bananas and slathered in hand-beaten whipped cream. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I loved watching Edie with a big mustard-colored ceramic bowl cradled on her hip as she would beat a batter with her strong brown arm, her wooden spoon hitting the bowl with a plopping sound. In fact, the kitchen was where I headed as soon as I got off the school bus and threw down my books. Not only did I want to know what was for dinner and to watch it all magically come together, but I was fascinated by Edie&#x2019;s other life. She came from Barbados and at my urging would tell me about the foods she grew up on&#x2014;strange fruits I&#x2019;d never heard of, hot peppers that made one sweat, and, of course, garlic. I&#x2019;d sometimes get cheeky enough to ask what she was going to make for her boyfriend on her Thursday night off, and as she described the food, I would long to have her spirit me off to Harlem with her. Instead, to spare my mother having to cook, we were taken to a prissy little restaurant on Lexington Avenue called Susan Prince that served the kind of food we had at home. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>When I was asked during my middle-school years what I would like for lunch on Fridays&#x2014;the day when we had to stay in school until only one o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;I knew exactly what I wanted: a whole artichoke, spaghetti and cheese, and fresh fruit or applesauce for dessert. The spaghetti and cheese that Edie made was more sauce than pasta (a term we didn&#x2019;t even know then&#x2014;it was either spaghetti or macaroni), enriched with massive gratings of good Vermont Cheddar cheese, then baked in a casserole with buttered crumbs and more cheese on top. I made a ritual of slurping down those hot creamy strands of spaghetti and alternately picking off artichoke leaves, one by one, dipping them in lemony butter or hollandaise, and scraping off the flesh with my teeth. I did it slowly, often turning the pages of a book. Then, when I got to the heart, I would carefully pull off all the thistles and revel in that concentrated, slightly grassy-tasting artichoke flesh. If I had a sip of milk, it was curious how the artichoke flavor distorted the taste of the milk. I found the same true when I graduated to wine. So this was one taste treat better just enjoyed on its own. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>My father soon recognized that I inherited the food genes from his side of the family and decided to treat me to more adventurous fare. So on Saturdays he would take me to lunch at La Petite Maison, a typical French restaurant near us in Manhattan&#x2019;s East Sixties, and there I was able to wallow in onions as I broke through the cheesy toasted crust of a <i>soupe � l&#x2019;oignon</i> or to savor seafoods wrapped in delicate warm cr�pes, to say nothing of mopping up those winey sauces that hid who knows what. The only trouble was that quite often by mid-afternoon I would start throwing up. I could just hear my mother saying: See what happens to a child when she eats those foreign foods. But I was not to be deterred: We gradually isolated the culprit and found that I was allergic to scallops. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Incidentally, for many years I had to forgo those wonderful sea-briny mollusks, but when I was in my forties, my husband, Evan, who didn&#x2019;t really believe in allergies, started experimenting to see if he could wean me. Unbeknownst to me, he would slip just a shaving of a scallop into my serving of a fish soup he had made, and when there was no adverse reaction he would sneak a larger portion into whatever seafood dish he made next time. After several years of increasing doses, I was able to consume happily a whole plateful of fresh scallops, and I have been making up for my years of deprivation ever since. The moral of this story is not only that you shouldn&#x2019;t cling to childhood prejudices&#x2014;try to get over them&#x2014;but also remember that the body changes, and what poisoned you at ten years old may well nourish you pleasurably in middle life. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I think my most important awakening to the pleasures of cooking came when I was about eleven and bargained with my parents to let me spend one winter with my grandmother in Montpelier. After I&#x2019;d convinced them, my mother blurted out anxiously: &#x201c;But what if you get sick?&#x201d; My answer was that I had no intention of getting sick. And, of course, I didn&#x2019;t. Instead, I grew up. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I particularly loved spending time with my Aunt Marian, who lived a little way down the street from my grandmother&#x2019;s house. After school and on weekends, I would stop by and settle into her warm, sweet-smelling kitchen and watch as she prepared dishes she knew her husband liked. Uncle Doc was a popular GP in town, and often his visits to patients would last into the evening. But no matter the hour, Aunt Marian always had a hot dish and all the accompaniments ready and waiting for his return. I marveled not only at how she could be so flexible and have everything turn out just right, but also at the love she seemed to express in cooking. She kept notebooks of her favorite recipes, some clipped f...</p><h2>Star Wars: A New Hope The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy</h2><p>The galaxy is at war. <br><br>Although the Rebel Alliance has won a few battles against the Empire, hope is fading.

In other words, extremes. The fae like to traffic in absolutes, not this mucky, glorious middle ground.<br><br>San Francisco is a city of hills and valleys, impossible slopes and ridiculous workarounds, with residential streets so narrow that trying to park becomes an eternal game of slow-motion chicken interspersed with wide tourist boulevards designed to present everything in the best possible light. It doesn&#x2019;t help that so much of San Francisco burned down in 1906, allowing city planners to design half of the metro area according to a reasonable, sensible grid system, while the remaining slices of old San Francisco . . . weren&#x2019;t. And still aren&#x2019;t, and never will be, since the odds of the city burning down again are, thankfully, pretty slim.<br><br>This does make San Francisco a challenging place to do my job, since the terrain is frequently working against me. My name is October Daye. I&#x2019;m a knight errant in service to the Court of Shadowed Hills and, by extension, in service to the Kingdom in the Mists. Worse, I&#x2019;m a named and recognized hero of the realm. All this is a fancy way of saying that when fae problems impinge on the mortal world, it&#x2019;s on me to take care of them before they accidentally reveal the existence of Faerie to the mortal world. We&#x2019;ve been in hiding for a long time. &#x201c;A flying hedgehog slammed into my front window&#x201d; is not how we want to be discovered.<br><br>Hence my evening. Quentin, Danny, and I had been running around a residential neighborhood for more than two hours, moving as quietly as we could in an effort not to wake the neighbors. They weren&#x2019;t <i>our</i> neighbors, thankfully. If one of us did make too much noise and wake them up, we could make an excuse about a lost dog or something and run, secure in the knowledge that we&#x2019;d never see them again.<br><br>Humans are good at sleeping through ordinary night noises. Blame it on centuries of diurnal living. They tend to write off things that go bump in the night as overenthusiastic raccoons rummaging in their trash. The noises we were apt to make weren&#x2019;t quite as ordinary, and humans are substantially less inclined to ignore pointy-eared strangers running around outside their kitchen windows. Especially when those strangers are waving butterfly nets over their heads like a bunch of weirdoes.<br><br>To be fair, we <i>are</i> a bunch of weirdoes. It&#x2019;s just that we were a bunch of weirdoes on a mission, and I didn&#x2019;t want that mission to involve yet another run-in with the local police. I think they&#x2019;re getting tired of my face. I know I&#x2019;ve long since gotten tired of theirs. And, really, waking the neighbors was less of a concern than what would happen if we were still outside when the sun came up and burned away all our illusions. That would be when we declared ourselves officially screwed.<br><br>As if we weren&#x2019;t screwed already. Because so much of San Francisco is built on impractically steep hills, many residential streets are connected by narrow alleys which serve as conduits for the stairways lain along the line of the hills. Some of the stairs are stone, some of the stairs are wood; all of the stairs are maintained by the local residents, and that means most of the stairs are death traps. No two steps are the same height, making them a constant tripping hazard, and half the wood stairways have at least one stair that&#x2019;s been rotted through for a decade without anyone getting around to fixing it.<br><br>In case that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, a damp wind had blown in from the Bay, and <i>all</i> the stairs were slippery. The night had been an adventure, and I was not in an adventurous mood.&nbsp;<br><br>Danny&#x2014;our designated driver for the evening, and one of my staunchest, most indestructible allies&#x2014;propped his butterfly net against his shoulder and frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just sayin&#x2019;, maybe you&#x2019;d feel better if you actually learned to open up about your feelings,&#x201d; he said, voice deep and gravelly enough to have come from a concrete mixer instead of from a man.<br><br>The impression wasn&#x2019;t far off. Despite the illusion which made him look like a reasonably nonthreatening human man, Danny is and has always been very far from human. Like most Bridge Trolls, he stands easily seven feet tall, with skin the color and consistency of granite. He&#x2019;s as difficult to injure as your average mountain, which is one of the many things that makes him such desirable backup when I&#x2019;m called upon to do knight errantry in the local cities.<br><br>I heal fast, but it&#x2019;s easier on my wardrobe if I have something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;I can duck behind to keep myself from being hurt in the first place. That&#x2019;s a very healthy attitude on my part, especially considering how often my friends and allies accuse me of having a self-destructive streak.<br><br>Unfortunately, those same friends and allies seemed to be too busy focusing on my latest set of problems to see how proactive and mature I was being. I glowered at him.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about this right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t want to talk about it in the car, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quentin was in the car.&#x201d;<br><br>Danny scowled down his nose at me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a kid anymore. You know that better than anybody.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about it,&#x201d; I grumbled. My squire, Quentin Sollys, had been a dandelion-haired bundle of limbs, manners, and annoying points of etiquette when he&#x2019;d initially forced his way into my life&#x2014;and I do mean <i>forced</i>. I hadn&#x2019;t been looking for a squire. I hadn&#x2019;t been looking for someone to take care of. I certainly hadn&#x2019;t been looking for a teenage boy to eat all my groceries and complain when I was out of ice cream. I&#x2019;d somehow managed to acquire all three of those things in one body, and it had turned out to be surprisingly wonderful and exactly what I&#x2019;d needed.<br><br>Until I&#x2019;d learned he was the Crown Prince of the Westlands, aka, &#x201c;all of North America.&#x201d; That had been less wonderful, since suddenly it wasn&#x2019;t just my squire I was shoving merrily into danger as a learning experience, it was the future of my entire continent. Not that the knowledge had stopped me for long. What&#x2019;s a squire for, if not testing for traps?<br><br>And he&#x2019;d continued growing up the whole time, going from a kid whose biggest romance had been the hand-holding and kissing kind with a human girl from a local high school to full-on dating one of the local Counts. Trying to have the sex talk with my squire was not an experience I wanted to repeat. That meant never taking another squire, and honestly, I was fine with that if it meant sparing myself the squirming indignity.<br><br>&#x201c;So how about you actually <i>talk</i> for a change, and not go looking for excuses?&#x201d;<br><br>I pinched the bridge of my nose. &#x201c;You really think this is the time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t seeing a better one.&#x201d; Danny shrugged like a landslide. &#x201c;I also ain&#x2019;t seeing any magical flying piggies, so I guess we can take a few minutes to talk about the elephant in the room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are too many nonexistent animals in that sentence, Danny.&#x201d; I dropped my hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not looking for pigs, we&#x2019;re looking for hedgehogs. Totally different.&#x201d;<br><br>Specifically, we were hunting for arkan sonney, a fae creature originally found in Avalon. They aren&#x2019;t supposed to exist in the mortal world. They certainly aren&#x2019;t supposed to infest upscale San Francisco neighborhoods. Unfortunately, a changeling named Chelsea Ames lost control of her powers about two years ago, and &#x201c;supposed to&#x201d; no longer reliably applies. Chelsea&#x2019;s father, Etienne, is Tuatha de Dannan, and she inherited his teleporting magic without inheriting his control, or the natural limitations that would have kept her from opening doors Oberon wanted closed.<br><br>Chelsea&#x2019;s lack of limitations might have been okay, had she not come to the attention of a local Duchess with an interest in expansion. Duchess Riordan had decided to use Chelsea to rip open doors to deeper Faerie, which Oberon had sealed for a thrice-damned <i>reason</i>.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t pretty, but in the end, Chelsea survived, Riordan got her just desserts, and we wound up with a minor monster problem. Because, see, open portals go both ways, and Chelsea hadn&#x2019;t exactly been watching to make sure none of the local wildlife followed her through. Being fae creatures, some of our unwanted guests had proven incredibly adept at concealing themselves, and we only found out they were in the mortal world when they popped out and scared the locals.<br><br>Danny snorted. &#x201c;Pigs, hedgehogs, whatever. They have wings, they shouldn&#x2019;t be here, and they&#x2019;re <i>not</i> here, which means we have time to talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Danny, this isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If he blames you, he needs to stop. And if he won&#x2019;t stop, then maybe you need to think about whether he&#x2019;s good for you. Or whether you&#x2019;re good for him.&#x201d;<br><br>I froze. For a terrible moment, I wasn&#x2019;t looking at Danny, my friend and ally. I was looking at Tybalt, my former enemy, current lover, and best friend, as he stepped into the shadows at the corner of my bedroom and disappeared, leaving me alone. The one thing he&#x2019;d promised I was never going to be again. The scent of pennyroyal and musk hung in the air, taunting me with my inability to follow him.<br><br>I blinked. The moment passed. Danny reappeared, looking concerned, and I hated him, oh, how I hated him. Not for long. More than long enough.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but yeah,&#x201d; said Danny.<br><br>Being a hero of the realm means I&#x2019;m constantly putting myself in the path of danger, like I want nothing more than to have my bones broken and the skin stripped from my body. Being a person means I&#x2019;m never doing it alone. I have friends. I have allies. Not just Quentin and Danny, but others, like my Fetch-turned-sister, May, and her girlfriend, Jazz.<br><br>Like Tybalt, the King of Dreaming Cats. The man who&#x2019;d hated me, helped me, fallen in love with me, and saved my life more times than I cared to count. The man who was supposed to marry me.<br><br>The man who could barely even look at me anymore.<br><br>Who hadn&#x2019;t been able to look at me since my mother, Amandine the Liar, had decided to lock him in a cage and trap him in feline form until she was done with him. Tybalt didn&#x2019;t blame me for my mother&#x2019;s actions&#x2014;I blamed me more than he did&#x2014;but when he looked at me, he saw her, and it was breaking us both.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about this,&#x201d; I said softly.<br><br>&#x201c;I know. But maybe you should.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s for you to decide.&#x201d;<br><br>Danny sighed. &#x201c;Toby, this isn&#x2019;t healthy. You need&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever he thought I needed was cut off by the sound of Quentin&#x2019;s sudden, high-pitched yelp. I whipped around, scanning the shadows until I spotted the outline of my squire, half a block away and struggling to keep hold of his butterfly net. He&#x2019;d managed to snare something the size of a small raccoon, and whatever it was, it looked like it was winning.<br><br>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; I snapped, casting a quick look back to Danny before I raised my own net and ran toward Quentin, ready to join the fray.<br><br>The trouble with hunting creatures no one has seen in hundreds of years is that when figuring out how to capture or subdue them, we have to rely on the accounts of people who have long since forgotten what the beasts were actually<i> like </i>and have, instead, started remembering them through pleasantly rose-tinted nostalgia. According to the records in the Library of Stars, arkan sonney are sweet, playful creatures, like hedgehogs with wings longer than their bodies, capable of bestowing great fortune on people and places that please them. Supposedly, they&#x2019;re also about as intelligent as the average sheep, and regularly had to be fished out of wells or freed from hunters&#x2019; traps back when they coexisted with the rest of Faerie.<br><br>The thing Quentin had snared in his net bore about as much resemblance to something sweet and innocent and bumbling as I did to a eucalyptus tree. For one thing, it was far too large, and the records hadn&#x2019;t mentioned anything about arkan sonney being chalk white with blazing red eyes and enormous tusks. It looked less like an ordinary hedgehog than it did the result of some unholy hybridization of a porcupine and a wild pig, with the wings of a falcon stapled on for good measure.&nbsp;<br><br>It thrashed. It squealed. It gnashed its terrible teeth at Quentin, who quailed but stood fast, refusing to let go of the net and allow the creature to escape. Brave boy. That was on him, although if I&#x2019;d asked, he would have said it was all because of what he&#x2019;d learned from me. Quentin had always been brave. He&#x2019;d just needed someone to let him show it.<br><br>The sound of my approach caught his attention. He shot me a grateful glance, still struggling to keep hold of the net. Our location meant we couldn&#x2019;t shout the way we normally would have, and Tybalt&#x2019;s absence meant we didn&#x2019;t have a major part of our backup. We&#x2019;d grown shamefully accustomed to having someone who could step through the shadows in the field with us.<br><br>I am nothing if not a skilled improvisor. I glanced frantically around. A trash can rested on a nearby curb, set out for the garbage collectors. Saying a silent apology to the sleeping homeowners, I grabbed it, dumped its contents out, and hoisted it over my head as I ran toward Quentin. Realizing my intent, he let go of the net right before I slammed the trash can down over the shrieking pig-thing.<br><br>Silence reigned. I looked up, meeting Quentin&#x2019;s wide, startled eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>His shoulders sagged. &#x201c;Her Majesty said there were at least three.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her name is Arden,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not here. You don&#x2019;t have to use her title.&#x201d;<br><br>Quentin actually smirked at that, although the expression wasn&#x2019;t enough to drive the weariness and worry from his eyes. &#x201c;Can I be there when you tell her that?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Better yet, can I be there when you tell my <i>father</i> that?&#x201d;<br><br>I grimaced. Arden is the daughter of the last legitimate King in the Mists, Gilad Windermere, and as such, has been a princess all her life. The throne was always going to be waiting for her, no matter what else she chose to do . . . or what else was done to her. Thanks to the machinations of Evening Winterrose&#x2014;once my supposed friend and ally, always secretly my enemy, Firstborn daughter of Oberon and Titania, and stone-cold bitch&#x2014;Arden had been in hiding for most of her life and had only recently been able to claim her father&#x2019;s throne. We were all still getting used to the idea that we had a queen who wasn&#x2019;t regularly going to try to have me arrested or banished from the Mists.</p><h2>The Starlight Barking: The Sequel to The Hundred and One Dalmatians (Wyatt Book)</h2><p><p>Dodie Smith's The Hundred and One Dalmatians, later adapted by Disney, was declared a classic when first published in 1956.

In fact, the exorbitantly paid have continued to thrive during the current economic crisis, even as the rest of Americans have continued to fall behind. Why do the &#x201c;haveit- alls&#x201d; have so much more? And how have they managed to restructure the economy to reap the lion&#x2019;s share of the gains and shift the costs of their new economic playground downward, tearing new holes in the safety net and saddling all of us with increased debt and risk? Lots of so-called experts claim to have solved this great mystery, but no one has really gotten to the bottom of it&#x2014;until now. <br><br>In their lively and provocative <i>Winner-Take-All Politics, </i>renowned political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson demonstrate convincingly that the usual suspects&#x2014;foreign trade and financial globalization, technological changes in the workplace, increased education at the top&#x2014;are largely innocent of the charges against them. Instead, they indict an unlikely suspect and take us on an entertaining tour of the mountain of evidence against the culprit. The guilty party is American politics. Runaway inequality and the present economic crisis reflect what government has done to aid the rich and what it has not done to safeguard the interests of the middle class. The winner-take-all economy is primarily a result of winner-take-all politics. <br><br>In an innovative historical departure, Hacker and Pierson trace the rise of the winner-take-all economy back to the late 1970s when, under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, a major transformation of American politics occurred. With big business and conservative ideologues organizing themselves to undo the regulations and progressive tax policies that had helped ensure a fair distribution of economic rewards, deregulation got under way, taxes were cut for the wealthiest, and business decisively defeated labor in Washington. And this transformation continued under Reagan and the Bushes as well as under Clinton, with both parties catering to the interests of those at the very top. Hacker and Pierson&#x2019;s gripping narration of the epic battles waged during President Obama&#x2019;s first two years in office reveals an unpleasant but catalyzing truth: winner-take-all politics, while under challenge, is still very much with us. <br><br><i>Winner-Take-All Politics</i>&#x2014;part revelatory history, part political analysis, part intellectual journey&#x2014; shows how a political system that traditionally has been responsive to the interests of the middle class has been hijacked by the superrich. In doing so, it not only changes how we think about American politics, but also points the way to rebuilding a democracy that serves the interests of the many rather than just those of the wealthy few.</p><p>Jacob S.

There is an exciting discovery that immediately creates mystery. The scene has clues to pore over (increasingly, with the latest in forensic technology). Suspects are found and interrogated, their motives questioned, their alibis probed. And if the crime drama is worth its salt, there are surprises along the way&#x2014;unexpected twists and turns that hopefully lead to a satisfying explanation of the once-mysterious felony.<br><br>This book starts with a mystery every bit as puzzling as that of the typical crime drama, and far more important for the lives of Americans: Why, after a generation following World War II in which prosperity was broadly distributed up and down the income ladder, did the gains of economic growth start going mostly to those at the top? Why has the economy become more risky and unreliable for most Americans even as it has created vast riches for the well-positioned and well-off? The mystery is dramatic. The scene is strewn with clues. And yet this mystery has continued to bedevil some of the nation&#x2019;s finest economic detectives.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not as if the post-1970s transformation of our economy has gone unnoticed, of course: Even before the economic crisis that shook the nation in 2008, scores of economists and experts in allied fields, like sociology and political science, were creatively crunching the numbers and fiercely debating their meaning. Yet again and again, they have found themselves at dead ends or have missed crucial evidence. After countless arrests and interrogations, the demise of broad-based prosperity remains a frustratingly open case, unresolved even as the list of victims grows longer.<br><br>All this, we are convinced, is because a crucial suspect has largely escaped careful scrutiny: American politics. Understandably, investigators seeking to explain a set of economic events have sought out economic suspects. But the economic suspects, for the most part, have strong alibis. They were not around at the right time. Or they were in a lot of countries, doing just the same thing that they did in the United States, but without creating an American-style winner-take-all economy.<br><br>This chapter is not the place to pin the case on American politics&#x2014;or spell out exactly <i>how</i> American politics did it. These are tasks for the rest of this book. But we will show what a convincing solution has to look like and introduce the clues that lead us to zero in on American politics as our prime suspect. In the next chapter, we will start laying out what we mean when we say, &#x201c;American politics did it.&#x201d; For, as will become clear, resolving our first mystery only raises a deeper one: How, in a political system built on the ideal of political equality and in which middle-class voters are thought to have tremendous sway, has democratic politics contributed so mightily to the shift toward winner-take-all?<br><br><b>Investigating the Scene</b><br><br>As in any investigation, we cannot find the suspects unless we know more or less what happened. A body dead for twenty-four hours yields a very different set of hunches than one dead for twenty-four years. Likewise, we need to be able to characterize the winner-take-all economy in clear, simple, and empirically verifiable terms to rule certain explanations out and others in. Unfortunately, much of the discussion of our current economic state of affairs has lacked such clarity.<br><br>Indeed, most of the economic investigators have actually been looking in the wrong place. Fixated on the widening gap between skilled and unskilled workers, they have divided the economic world into two large groups: the &#x201c;haves&#x201d; with college or advanced degrees; the &#x201c;have-nots&#x201d; without them. The clues suggest, however, that the real mystery is the runaway incomes and assets of the &#x201c;have-it-alls&#x201d;&#x2014;those on the very highest rungs of the economic ladder. These fortunate few are, in general, no better educated or obviously more skilled than those on the rungs just below, who have experienced little or none of these meteoric gains.<br><br>The mystery, further, is not just why the have-it-alls have more and more. It is also how they have managed to restructure the economy to shift the risks of their new economic playground downward, saddling Americans with greater debt, tearing new holes in the safety net, and imposing broad financial risks on Americans as workers, investors, and taxpayers. The rising rewards at the top, as startling and important as they are, are only a symptom of a broader transformation of the American economy. The deeper mystery is how our economy stopped working to provide security and prosperity for the broad middle class. The deeper mystery, the mystery that has yet to be systematically outlined or unraveled, is the rise of the <i>winner-take-all economy</i>.<br><br>A big reason for the continuing confusion is that the largest body of evidence on which economic investigators have traditionally relied fails to capture the crucial facts. Most of those who have asked how the poor, middle class, and rich have fared have examined national surveys of income, such as the Census Bureau&#x2019;s widely used Current Population Survey&#x2014;the basis for those annual summaries of income and poverty trends that appear in the news late each summer. These surveys, however, have a serious problem: They do not reach many rich people and, even when they do, do not usually show their exact incomes. (Instead, they cap the maximum amount disclosed, a practice known as top coding.) As a result, most investigators are examining the winner-take-all economy without looking at the winners at all. It is as if <i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</i> took you on an exciting tour of the financial life of a couple making $125,000 a year (&#x201c;Look: their own washer and dryer!&#x201d;).<br><br>Enter two young economists who have turned the investigation upside down: Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. They are a transcontinental team&#x2014;Piketty is now based at the Paris School of Economics, while Saez is at the University of California, Berkeley (both are natives of France). In 2009, at age thirty-six, Saez was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal for the economist younger than forty making the greatest contribution to the discipline. The medal was, in large part, for pathbreaking work that he and Piketty have done using income tax statistics to paint a new and revealing portrait of the distribution of economic rewards in the United States and other rich nations.1<br><br>Piketty and Saez&#x2019;s approach is simple but revolutionary. Rather than talking to witnesses, the most important of whom (the rich) cannot be easily found, they scour the scene itself. More precisely, Piketty and Saez tap into a source of data that is particularly good at revealing what the have-it-alls actually have: namely, income reported when paying taxes. Information that taxpayers provide about their wages, salaries, capital gains, and other income may contain errors&#x2014;and sometimes deliberate errors. But tax forms require careful documentation that income surveys don&#x2019;t, and taxpayers have strong legal inducements to get the numbers right. More important, the one group that the tax code generally singles out for special scrutiny is the rich, the very people whom income surveys tend to miss. To be sure, the tax data are not without flaws, and Piketty and Saez assiduously try to correct them (for example, they adjust the results to account for the fact that some people don&#x2019;t file tax returns).1 But they are enormously better than survey results in capturing the full distribution of economic rewards.<br><br>And what the Piketty and Saez evidence uniquely shows is just how sharply our economy has tilted toward winner-take-all. Most of the gains of economic growth since the 1970s have gone precisely to those that the commonly used surveys miss&#x2014;not just the top 10 percent, but especially the top 1 percent, and especially the highest reaches of the top 1 percent.<br><br><b>Three Big Clues</b><br><br>Compared with the standard surveys that portray the rich as earning upper-middle-class salaries, Piketty and Saez&#x2019;s data are like DNA evidence in a case previously investigated using only eyewitness accounts. As it turns out, the DNA evidence reveals three essential clues that were previously neglected.<br><br><b>Clue #1: Hyperconcentration of Income</b><br><br>The first clue is that the gains of the winner-take-all economy, befitting its name, have been extraordinarily <i>concentrated</i>. Though economic gaps have grown across the board, the big action is at the top, especially the very top.<br><br>To grasp this point, consider an alternate reality in which income grows at the same pace for all groups in society. In this scenario, the rich get richer at the same rate as everyone else, so the share of national income earned by the rich stays constant. We might call this imaginary country Broadland&#x2014;a counterfactual parallel to the real world of runaway gains at the top that the writer Robert Frank has evocatively termed &#x201c;Richistan.&#x201d;2<br><br>Broadland would not be some kind of egalitarian fantasy. It would simply be a country where economic growth was making the income distribution neither more equal nor less. It would, in fact, be pretty close to the situation that existed from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, a period in which incomes actually grew at a slightly faster rate at the bottom and middle of the economic distribution than at the top.<br><br>But Broadland is not the world of the past generation. Instead, the share of income earned by the top 1 percent has increased from around 8 percent in 1974 to more than 18 percent in 2007 (the last year covered by the data)&#x2014;a more than twofold increase. If you include capital gains like investment and dividend income, the share of the top 1 percent has gone from just over 9 percent to 23.5 percent. The only time since 1913 (the first year of the data) that this share has been higher was 1928, on the eve of the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, when it tickled 24 percent.<br><br>But the top 1 percent, while seemingly an exclusive group, is much too broad a category to pinpoint the most fortunate beneficiaries of the post-1970s income explosion at the top. The Piketty and Saez evidence allows us to climb higher up the economic ladder and peer into the pocketbooks of the richest tenth of a percent and even the richest hundredth of a percent&#x2014;yes, 0.1 percent and 0.01 percent&#x2014;of Americans. The latter comprise the highest-earning 15,000 or so families in the United States, a group in which we would expect <i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</i> to have little trouble finding private jets and opulent mansions.<br><br>Plenty of jets and mansions, it turns out: The top 0.1 percent (the richest one in a thousand households) collectively rake in more than $1 trillion a year including capital gains&#x2014;which works out to an average annual income of more than $7.1 million. In 1974, by comparison, the top 0.1 percent&#x2019;s average income was just over $1 million. (All these incomes are adjusted for inflation by expressing them in 2007 dollars.) In terms of the share of national income earned, the top 0.1 percent have seen their slice of the pie grow from 2.7 percent to 12.3 percent of income&#x2014;a more than <i>fourfold</i> increase.<br><br>We shall say more about <i>who</i> is in this rarefied group in the chapters to come, but for now, let us simply note that its denizens are not, for the most part, superstars and celebrities in the arts, entertainment, and sports. Nor are they rentiers, living off their accumulated wealth, as was true in the early part of the last century. A substantial majority are company executives and managers, and a growing share of these are financial company executives and managers. High earners in law, medicine, real estate, and other potentially lucrative fields also make an appearance, but they pale in prominence to the &#x201c;working rich&#x201d; of the executive world.3<br><br>By now it will come as no surprise that the gains within this superrich group are themselves highly concentrated. While things have been good for the top 0.1 percent, the top 0.01 percent (the richest one in ten thousand households) has seen an even more spectacular rise. From less than $4 million in average annual income in 1974, the average member of this select group now earns more than $35 million. From earning less than 1 of every 100 dollars, these supremely fortunate souls now earn more than 1 of every 17&#x2014;or more than 6 percent of national income accruing to 0.01 percent of families. This is the highest share of income going to this group since the data began to be collected in 1913.<br><br>The more closely we look at changes in the distribution of economic rewards, the more it becomes clear that the big gains have been concentrated at the very, very top.4 According to Piketty and Saez&#x2019;s revealing evidence regarding pre-tax incomes, we have gone from Broadland to Richistan&#x2014;from a world in which most of the nation&#x2019;s income gains accrue to the bottom 90 percent of households (the pattern of the economic expansion of the 1960s) to one in which more than half go to the richest 1 percent (the pattern of the last economic expansion from 2002 to 2007). For those in the tightly circumscribed winner&#x2019;s circle of the winner-take-all economy, the last generation has truly been a golden age.<br><br><b>Clue #2: Sustained Hyperconcentration</b><br><br>The DNA evidence reveals a second important clue: The shift of income toward the top has been <i>sustained,</i> increasing steadily (and, by historical standards, extremely rapidly) since around 1980.<br><br>Figure 1 tells the story. The poor may not be getting poorer, but the rich have been steadily pulling away: in good times (the strong economy of the mid-to late 1990s) and in bad times (the very weak economy of the early 1980s); under Republican presidents (Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, whose presidencies are shaded in gray on the figure) and under Democratic President Clinton. The only brief reversals occur during the dives in the stock market that occurred in the late 1980s and around 2000. But the occasional setback associated with a decline in the stock market has only been a springboard to new heights. For thirty years, the good times have just kept rolling.<br><br>The solution to our mystery, in short, needs to account for a simple fact: The rising share of national income captured by the richest Americans is a long-term trend beginning around 1980. It is a trend, moreover, that is not obviously related to either the business cycle or the shifting partisan occupancy of the White House.5 The partisan to-and-fro and economic ebb and flow surely had some part to play. But something else was at work in creating the winner-take-all economy&#x2014;something that fostered a sharp divide between broadly shared prosperity and winner-take-all.<br><br><b><b>The Richest 1 Percent&#x2019;s Share of National Income (Including Capital Gains), 1960&#x2013;2007</b></b><br><br><b>Clue #3: Limited Benefits for the Nonrich</b><br><br>We come, finally, to the third clue&#x2014;and perhaps the most puzzling of all. It is so puzzling, and potentially controversial, that we spend much of the rest of this chapter documenting and delving into it.<br><br>The third clue is this: In an era in which those at the top reaped massive gains, the economy stopped working for middle- and working-class Americans. We know that the rich grew fabulously richer over this period. We know that relative to the rich, the rest of Americans lost ground. But what we have not yet investigated is whether they lost ground overall. How well did they fare in an era in which so large a share of economic gains accrued to those above them? Did they become richer and more economicall...</p><h2>Secret Drugs of Buddhism: Psychedelic Sacraments and the Origins of the Vajrayana</h2><p>Secret Drugs of Buddhism is the first book to explore the historical evidence for the use of entheogenic plants within the Buddhist tradition. Drawing on scriptural sources, botany, pharmacology, and religious iconography, this book calls attention to the central role which psychedelics played in Indian religions. It traces their history from the mysterious soma potion, celebrated in the most ancient Hindu scriptures, to amrita, the sacramental drink of Vajrayana Buddhism. Although amrita used in modern Vajrayana ceremonies lacks any psychoactivity, there is copious evidence that the amrita used by the earliest Vajrayana practitioners was a potent entheogen. It is the nature of this psychedelic form of the sacrament which is the central topic of this book. In particular, Secret Drugs of Buddhism attempts to identify the specific ingredients employed in amrita&#x2019;s earliest formulations. To this end, the book presents evidence from many countries in which the Vajrayana movement flourished. These include Bhutan, Japan, Mongolia, and Tibet but special attention is given to India, the land of its origin.</p><p>Michael Crowley was born Feb. 26th, 1948 (100th anniversary of The Communist Manifesto) in Cardiff, Wales.

Gunnar Karlsson, that country's premier historian, chronicles the age of the Sagas, consulting them to describe an era without a monarch or central authority. Equating this prosperous time with the golden age of antiquity in world history, Karlsson then marks a correspondence between the Dark Ages of Europe and Iceland's "dreary period", which started with the loss of political independence in the late thirteenth century and culminated with an epoch of poverty and humility, especially during the early Modern Age.<p>Iceland's renaissance came about with the successful struggle for independence in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and with the industrial and technical modernization of the first half of the twentieth century. Karlsson describes the rise of nationalism as Iceland's mostly poor peasants set about breaking with Denmark, and he shows how Iceland in the twentieth century slowly caught up economically with its European neighbors.</p></p><p>Gunnar Karlsson is Professor in the Department of Education at Stockholm University.

There is only / mine / or yours,&#x2013; / but the world / will be filled with the living.&#x201d; In prayerlike poems he invokes the one &#x201c;who spoke the world / into being&#x201d; and celebrates a dazzling universe&#x2013;snowflakes descending at nightfall, the intense yellow petals of the September sunflower, the planet adrift in a blizzard of stars, the simple mystery of loving other people.

In this vividly written biography, William E. Wallace offers a substantially new view of the artist. Not only a supremely gifted sculptor, painter, architect, and poet, Michelangelo was also an aristocrat who firmly believed in the ancient and noble origins of his family. The belief in his patrician status fueled his lifelong ambition to improve his family's financial situation and to raise the social standing of artists. Michelangelo's ambitions are evident in his writing, dress, and comportment, as well as in his ability to befriend, influence, and occasionally say "no" to popes, kings, and princes. Written from the words of Michelangelo and his contemporaries, this biography not only tells his own stories but also brings to life the culture and society of Renaissance Florence and Rome. Not since Irving Stone's novel The Agony and the Ecstasy has there been such a compelling and human portrayal of this remarkable yet credible human individual. <br><br> Subscribe to William Wallace's podcast on individual works of the master!

In searching for that answer, he naturally begins to spin his reels, firm in the belief that the solution to any question or problem is to go fishing, "and the worse the problem, the longer the trip should be."<p> Of course, Gierach's life is one extended fishing trip, so he sets out for pools and streams from Montana and Michigan to British Columbia and his own Colorado, musing along the way on subsets of that last fair question like technique versus inner grace, the number of fish you actually catch, the stories you come home with, and the company you choose to cast your lot--and flies--with. As expected with Gierach, the essays of this spirited array are less answers in themselves than provocatively enjoyable journeys through a richly literate and detailed landscape of interesting bugs (the chapter called "Boatmen"), obsessions ("Getting Stuck"), local streams ("Taking It Personally"), and even a memorial service held off until the fish were biting ("Jordan River"). In the end, Gierach is left where he began, "certain that on the day I become a truly sublime fly-fisher, all my failings will be overshadowed and all my demons will swim under rocks and stay there until I go away." Until that day comes, he'll just have to take solace from the way he continues to hook us pleasurably on the natural resources of his own prose. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing.

Torn from their homes and families, these men, women, and children were loaded into shipboard cattle stalls and abandoned in a lawless place where brutality held sway. Many did not have leprosy, and many who did were not contagious, yet all were ensnared in a shared nightmare.<br> <br>Here, for the first time, John Tayman reveals the complete history of the Molokai settlement and its unforgettable inhabitants. It's an epic of ruthless manhunts, thrilling escapes, bizarre medical experiments, and tragic, irreversible error. Carefully researched and masterfully told, <i>The Colony</i> is a searing tale of individual bravery and extraordinary survival, and stands as a testament to the power of faith, compassion, and the human spirit.</p><p><b>John Tayman</b> is editor at large of <i>Men's Health</i>.

He lives in Northern California. Visit his website at www.johntayman.com.From 1866 to 1969, the remote island of Molokai was home to all Hawaiian leprosy patients. This chronological story follows the history of the institution from its shameful beginnings through its development into a decent medical facility by the tireless Father Damien. It is also a testament to human will--the stories of the patients are compelling. Patrick Lawlor is empathetic and clear, differentiating the narrative from the many quotations from diaries, letters, and interviews. He develops a myriad of realistic accents for a multitude of people, ranging from visiting Scotsman Robert Louis Stevenson, doctors from all over the world, and Flemish priests to dozens of Hawaiian patients.

Unfortunately, those in the academy tend to have the opposite problem, failing to connect theological study to the pressing issues facing the church today. Contemporary evangelicalism has lost sight of the inherent connection between pastoral leadership and theology. This results in theologically anemic churches, and ecclesial anemic theologies.</p><p>Todd Wilson and Gerald Hiestand contend that among a younger generation of evangelical pastors and theologians, there is a growing appreciation for the native connection between theology and pastoral ministry. At the heart of this recovery of a theological vision for ministry is the re-emergence of the role of the "pastor theologian."</p><p>The Pastor Theologian presents a taxonomy of the pastor-theologian and shows how individual pastors&#x2014;given their unique calling and gift-set&#x2014;can best embody this age-old vocation in the 21st century.

Todd is married to Katie, his high school sweetheart, and they have seven children, three biological and four adopted from Ethiopia."<i>The Pastor-Theologian</i> may be a small book, but it is an ambitious one. Gerald Hiestand and Todd Wilson summon the church to return to a time when pastors were theologians and theologians pastors, when pastors served as <i>intellectual </i>shepherds of the church. The renewal of what they call ecclesial theology will provide a needed transfusion into theologically anemic pastoral ministry and pastorally anemic theology." <br>-- <b>Peter Leithart,</b> Theopolis Institute<br><br>"If you're looking for canaries in the church's coal mines, consider our seminaries and divinity schools. In some cases, the seminary has simply become one more outpost of the academy, hijacked by the ideals of the research university, almost allergic to pastoral formation. In other cases, the seminary is reduced to a management seminar where the pastorate is confused with technique. <i>The Pastor-Theologian</i> is an antidote to both, a vision for ecclesial theology and a theological ecclesia. We need this book because we need pastor-theologians." <br>--<b>James K.A. Smith,</b><b></b> Calvin College<br><br>"Hiestand and Wilson shine a spotlight on a seismic fault whose damage to the church has been under the radar: the great divorce between the pastoral ministry and academic theology. They argue compellingly that a healthy church body needs red blood (pastoral energy) and gray brain cells (theological intelligence) to grow into Christian maturity. This is a book written in faith - the kind of faith that moves institutional mountains and raises, if not the dead, then at least defunct concepts - like the pastor-theologian." <br>--<b>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"What an exciting and timely book! Gerald Hiestand and Todd Wilson not only make a compelling case for reviving a distinguished tradition of pastor-theologian thought leaders. They also point the way for how this kind of leadership--much needed today!--can address the very new conditions in which the present day churches are called by God to minister."<br>--<b>Richard Mouw</b>, Fuller Seminary<br><br>"The case that Wilson and Hiestand present is winsome and utterly convincing, as they trace the history of the rise and demise of the pastor-theologian, and the resulting theological and ethical anemia of the church. But more, they provide us with a nuanced profile of the ecclesial theologian, and a reasoned way forward. <i>The Pastor-Theologian</i> is an exhilarating and heartening book-- and a must read for the church and the academy where it will produce lively, ministry- changing discussion! <br>--<b>R.

Officially sanctioned and true to the&nbsp;<i>Alien</i>&nbsp;canon,&nbsp;<i>Alien: Out of the Shadows</i>&nbsp;expands upon the well-loved mythos and is a must for all Alien fans.</p><p><b>Tim Lebbon</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of the movie novelization of&nbsp;<i>30 Days of Night</i>&nbsp;and<i>The Cabin in the Woods</i>. He has also written many critically acclaimed horror and dark fantasy novels, including&nbsp;<i>Dusk</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fallen</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Island</i>. Tim has won three British Fantasy Awards, a Bram Stoker Award, a Shocker, a Tombstone and been a finalist for the International Horror Guild and World Fantasy Awards.&#x201c;Lebbon&#x2019;s ability to make this a perfect fit is pretty damn amazing. And the telling of this tale in and of itself, without regard to external continuity, is a thing of beauty. Set between the first two films, it aptly captures the flavor of both, melded into one dark work of art. It contains the claustrophobia and shadowy, stark fear, not to mention the brilliant simplicity, of ALIEN, with the weapons-toting action thrills of the second.&#x201d;<i> &#x2013; </i>Book Devil<br><br>"A gripping and recommended read" - Project Fandom<br><br>"If you&#x2019;re a fan of Xenomorphs or just enjoy great sci-fi/horror books, then you should definitely check out this novel." - Rely on Horror&nbsp;<br><br>"Lebbon provides some juicy details and ideas concerning the origins of the xenomorphs while adding to Ripley&#x2019;s personal yet-to-be-discovered connection to the monsters." - High Def Digest<br><br>"The writing was excellent.

Lebbon&#x2019;s care for words and attention to detail proves to be profoundly rewarding, as Alien: Out of the Shadows is the finest venture back into the world of the xenomorph since Ridley Scott&#x2019;s Prometheus (which, in my opinion is only eclipsed by Alien and Aliens, despite the fact that I love the silly Alien vs. Predator). This is one of the finest &#x2013; if not the finest film tie-ins I&#x2019;ve read in years. And believe it or not, Out of the Shadows could well prove to be one of the year&#x2019;s very best." - Horror Novel<br><br>"The aliens are just as menacing and brutal as always, but the real horror of the novel lies in the suspense elements." - Smart Girls Love SciFI&nbsp;<br><br>"Plenty of nail-biting scenes." - Geek Dad<br><br>"The writing is superb." - Tracing the Stars<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Even if you have a passing interest in the Alien universe this book comes recommended, deftly balancing appeal to casual readers and hardcore fans alike.

So good. So twisty. So deathy." - BookRiot</p><h2>Fraidyzoo</h2><p>It&#x2019;s a great day to go to the zoo! As her family hustles to get out the door, Little T lags behind. She&#x2019;s afraid to go back to the zoo; the only trouble is, she can&#x2019;t remember why. As an ingenious solution to help her remember, her mom, dad, and sister construct homemade costumes and act out zoo animals&#x2015;in alphabetical order, no less! The costumes and scenes grow increasingly elaborate and breathtakingly creative. An umbrella and bubble wrap magically transform into a jellyfish, bath towels and a can of soda become a parrot, and many, many more. At the end of the day, Little T has conquered her fear and no longer feels like a &#x201c;fraidyzoo.&#x201d;<br> In this charming, witty picture book debut, Thyra Heder honors the bravery it takes to face your fears, and the loving people who help you do so. &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Fraidyzoo</i></b><br> <b>STARRED REVIEWS</b><br> "WARNING: Expect riotous buffoonery after reading this clever and original alphabet story, as kids will definitely want to &#x201c;parrot&#x201d; the examples."<br> &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review<br> <br> "Debut talent Heder comes up with a wildly imaginative idea for an alphabet book/animal guessing game, elaborates it with smartly drafted ink-and-watercolor spreads, and seasons it with plenty of family warmth and hullaballoo."<br> &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br> <br> "The cut-and-paste, handmade look and feel of this picture book underscores its thematic ode to creative problem solving...

She is also an illustrator and storyboard artist for film and advertising and lives in Brooklyn.<br><b></b>PreS-Gr 2-The cut-and-paste, handmade look and feel of this picture book underscores its thematic ode to creative problem solving. Little T is about to embark on a much-anticipated trip to the zoo with her family when she freezes up with fear. Her parents call time-out and undertake a laugh-out-loud, over-the-top attempt to pinpoint exactly which animal she seems to be afraid of. Utilizing household objects, recyclables, clothing, and everyday art materials, Mom, Dad, and sister construct a madcap, A-to-Z range of costumes to determine which creature could possibly be thwarting T's desire to go to the zoo. "Does it jump in the road?" asks Mom, holding V-shaped tongs to her head simulating deer's antlers; "Does it live in the tropics?" asks Dad, crawling around the floor in an iguana costume constructed with cardboard tubes and paper bags. And so on until nightfall, when T declares her fears banished and now wants to go to the zoo. (Who wouldn't, after all those entertaining theatrics?) But when they arrive the next day, an encounter with a certain zoo employee sends T's sister into a panic, an ironic twist to T's resolution of her own fears. The charming, detailed watercolor and ink illustrations really tell the story, and children will relish poring over them to guess the animal costumes and identify their construction materials. Pair this with titles such as Antoinette Portis's Not a Box (2006) and Not a Stick (2007, both HarperCollins) to jump-start kids' own creative juices.-Kathleen Finn, St. Francis Xavier School, Winooski, VT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

It lay on the floor near his feet where it had fallen.<br><br>His action was as purely automatic as an action can be. He let his Racing Form slip from his lap and cover the billfold. Then he sat very still, his heart pounding. The fat man who had dropped the wallet was talking to a friend on the far side of the box. As far as Fordyce could see, his own action had gone unobserved.<br><br>It had been a foolish thing to do. Fordyce did not need the money. He had been paid a week&#x2019;s salary only a short time before and had won forty dollars on the last race.<br><br>With his heart pounding heavily, his mouth dry, he made every effort to be casual as he picked up his Form and the wallet beneath. Trying to appear as natural as possible, he opened the billfold under cover of the Form, extracted the money, and shifted the bills to his pocket.<br><br>The horses were rounding into the home stretch, and when the crowd sprang to its feet, he got up, too. As he straightened, he shied the wallet, with an underhand flip, under the feet of the crowd off to his left.<br><br>His heart was still pounding. Blindly he stared out at the track. He was a thief . . . he had stolen money . . . he had appropriated it . . . how much?<br><br>Panic touched him suddenly. Suppose he had been seen? If someone had seen him, the person might wait to see if he returned the wallet. If he did not, the person might come down and accuse him. What if, even now, there was an officer waiting for him? Perhaps he should leave, get away from there as quickly as possible.<br><br>Cool sanity pervaded him. No, that would never do. He must remain where he was, go through the motions of watching the races. If he were accused, he could say he had won the money. He had won money&#x2014;forty dollars. The man at the window might remember his face but not the amount he had given him.<br><br>Fordyce was in the box that belonged to his boss, Ed Charlton, and no friend of Charlton&#x2019;s would ever be thought a thief. He sat still, watching the races, relaxing as much as he could. Surprisingly, the fat man who had dropped the wallet did not miss it. He did not even put a hand to his pocket.<br><br>After the sixth race, several people got up to leave, and Fordyce followed suit. It was not until he was unlocking his car that he realized there was a man at his elbow.<br><br>He was a tall, dark-eyed handsome young man, too smoothly dressed, too&#x2014;slick. And there was something sharply feral about his eyes. He was smiling unpleasantly.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice work!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Very nice! Now, how about a split?&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur Fordyce kept his head. Inside, he seemed to feel all his bodily organs contract as if with chill. &#x201c;I am afraid I don&#x2019;t understand you. What was it you wanted?&#x201d;<br><br>The brightly feral eyes hardened just a little, although the smile remained. &#x201c;A split, that&#x2019;s what I want. I saw you get that billfold. Now let&#x2019;s bust it open and see what we&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Billfold?&#x201d; Fordyce stared at him coldly, although he was quivering inside with fear. He had been seen! What if he should be arrested? What if Alice heard? Or Ed Charlton? Why, that fat man might be a friend of Ed&#x2019;s!<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give me that,&#x201d; the tall young man was saying. &#x201c;I saw the whole thing. Now, I&#x2019;m getting a split or I&#x2019;ll holler bull. I&#x2019;ll go to the cops. You aren&#x2019;t out of the grounds yet, and even if you were, I can find out who used Ed Charlton&#x2019;s box today.&#x201d;<br><br>Fordyce stood stock-still. This could not be happening to him. It&#x2014;it was preposterous! What ever had possessed him? Yet, what explanation could he give now? He had thrown away the wallet itself, a sure indication that he intended to keep the money.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Bud&#x201d;&#x2014;the smile was sneering now&#x2014;&#x201c;you might as well hand it over. There was plenty there. I had my eye on Linton all afternoon. He always carries plenty of dough.&#x201d;<br><br>Linton&#x2014;George Linton. How many times had Ed Charlton spoken of him. They were golfing companions. They hunted and fished together. They had been friends at college. Even if the money were returned, Fordyce was sure he would lose his job, his friends&#x2014;Alice. He would be finished, completely finished.<br><br>&#x201c;I never intended to do it,&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;It&#x2014;it was an accident.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah&#x201d;&#x2014;the eyes were contemptuous&#x2014;&#x201c;I could see that. I couldn&#x2019;t have done it more accidentally myself. Now, hand it over.&#x201d;<br><br>There was fourteen hundred dollars in fifties and twenties. With fumbling fingers, Fordyce divided it. The young man took his bills and folded them with the hands of a lover. He grinned suddenly.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice work! With my brains and your in we&#x2019;d make a team!&#x201d; He pocketed the bills, anxious to be gone. &#x201c;Be seeing you!&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur Fordyce did not reply. Cold and shaken, he stared after the fellow.<br>Days fled swiftly past. Fordyce avoided the track, worked harder than ever. Once he took Alice to the theater and twice to dinner. Then at a party the Charltons gave, he came face to face with George Linton.<br><br>The fat man was jovial. &#x201c;How are you, Fordyce? Ed tells me you&#x2019;re his right hand at the office. Good to know you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; He spoke without volition. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I see you at the track a couple of weeks ago? I was in Charlton&#x2019;s box.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes! I remember you now. I thought your face seemed familiar.&#x201d; He shook his head wryly. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t forget that day. My pocket was picked for nearly two thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeing that Alice was waiting, Fordyce excused himself and joined her. Together they walked to the terrace and stood there in the moonlight. How lovely she was! And, to think he had risked all this, risked it on the impulse of a moment, and for what? She was looking up at him, and he spoke suddenly, filled with the sudden panic born of the thought of losing her.<br><br>&#x201c;Alice!&#x201d; He gripped her arms, &#x201c;Alice! Will you marry me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, Arthur!&#x201d; she protested, laughing in her astonishment. &#x201c;How rough you are! Do you always grab a girl so desperately when you ask her to marry you?&#x201d;<br><br>He released her arms, embarrassed. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I guess I was violent,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I just&#x2014;well, I couldn&#x2019;t stand to lose you, Alice.&#x201d;<br><br>Her eyes were wide and wonderfully soft. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t going to, Arthur,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to stay with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then&#x2014;you mean&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Arthur.&#x201d;<br>Driving home that night his heart was bounding. She would marry him! How lovely she was! How beautiful her eyes had been as she looked up at him!<br><br>He drove into the garage, snapped off the lights and got his keys. It was not until he came out to close the doors that he saw the glow of a suddenly inhaled cigarette in the shadow cast by the shrubbery almost beside him.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Fordyce. How&#x2019;s tricks?&#x201d; It was the man from the track. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Chafey, Bill Chafey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing here? What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a beautiful babe you&#x2019;ve got. I&#x2019;ve seen her picture on the society pages.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I don&#x2019;t intend to discuss my fianc�e with you. It&#x2019;s very late and I must be getting to bed. Good night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Abrupt, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Chafey adopted a George Raft manner. &#x201c;Not going to invite an old friend inside for a drink? An old friend from out of town&#x2014;one who wants to meet your friends?&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur Fordyce saw it clearly, then, saw it as clearly as he would ever see anything. He knew what this slick young man was thinking&#x2014;that he would use his hold over Fordyce for introductions and for better chances to steal. Probably he had other ideas, too. Girls&#x2014;and their money.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, Chafey,&#x201d; he said harshly, &#x201c;whatever was between us is finished. Now beat it! And don&#x2019;t come back!&#x201d;<br><br>Chafey had seen a lot of movies. He knew what came next. He snapped his cigarette into the grass and took a quick step forward.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, you cheap thief! You think you can brush me off like that? Listen, I&#x2019;ve got you where I want you, and before I&#x2019;m through, I&#x2019;ll have everything you&#x2019;ve got!&#x201d; Chafey&#x2019;s voice was rising with some inner emotion of triumph or hatred. &#x201c;You think you&#x2019;re so much! Figure you can brush me off, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>He stepped close. &#x201c;What if I got to that fancy babe of yours and told her what I know? What if I go to Linton and tell him? You&#x2019;re a thief, Fordyce! A damned thief! You and that fancy babe of yours! Why&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Fordyce hit him. The action was automatic and it was unexpected. In the movies it was always the tough guy who handed out the beatings. His fist flew up and caught Chafey on the jaw. Chafey&#x2019;s feet flew up, and he went down, the back of his neck hitting the bumper with a sickening crack. Then his body slipped slowly to the ground.<br><br>Arthur Fordyce stood very still, staring down at the crumpled form. His breath was coming in great gasps, and his fist was still clenched hard. Some instinct told him the man was dead.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Fordyce?&#x201d; It was his neighbor, Joe Neal, calling. &#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>Fordyce dropped to one knee and touched the man&#x2019;s head. It lolled loosely, too loosely. He felt for the heart. Nothing. He bent over the man&#x2019;s face, but felt no breath, nothing.<br><br>Neal was coming out on the lawn, pulling his belt tight. &#x201c;Fordyce? Is anything wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>He got to his feet slowly. &#x201c;Yes, Joe. I wish you&#x2019;d come down here. I&#x2019;ve been held up and I think&#x2014;I think I&#x2019;ve killed him.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe Neal hurried up, flashlight in hand. He threw the light on the fallen man. &#x201c;Good heavens!&#x201d; he gasped. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was waiting there by the tree. He stepped out with his hand in his pocket&#x2014;you know, like he had a gun. I hit him before I realized.&#x201d;<br>That was the story, and he made it stick. For several days it was the talk of all his friends. Fordyce had killed a holdup man. That took nerve. And a punch, too. Didn&#x2019;t know he had it in him. Of course, it was the bumper that actually broke his neck. Still&#x2014;had there been any doubts&#x2014;and there were none&#x2014;a check of Chafey&#x2019;s record would have removed them.<br><br>He had done time and was on parole. He had gone up for armed robbery and had been arrested a score of times for investigation. He was suspected of rolling drunks and of various acts of petty pilfering and slugging. A week passed, and a second week. Arthur Fordyce threw himself into his work, never talking about what had happened.<br><br>Others forgot it, too, except Joe Neal. Once, commenting on it to his wife, he looked puzzled and said, &#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;d have sworn I heard voices that night. I&#x2019;d have sworn it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You might have. They might have argued. I imagine that a man might say a lot when excited and not remember it.&#x201d; That was what his wife said, and it was reasonable enough. Nevertheless, Joe Neal was faintly disturbed by it all. He avoided Fordyce. Not that they had ever been friends.<br>Arthur Fordyce had been lucky. No getting away from that. He had been very lucky, and sometimes when he thought about it, he felt a cold chill come over him. But it was finished now.<br><br>Only it wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>It was Monday night, two weeks after the inquest, the first night he had been home since it had happened. He was sitting in his armchair listening to the radio when the telephone rang. Idly, he lifted it from the cradle.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Fordyce?&#x201d; The voice was feminine and strange. &#x201c;Is this Arthur Fordyce?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Speaking.&#x201d;<br><br>There was an instant of silence. Then, &#x201c;This is Bill Chafey&#x2019;s girl-friend, Mr. Fordyce. I thought I would call and congratulate you. You seem to be very, very lucky!&#x201d;<br><br>The cold was there again in the pit of his stomach. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I beg your pardon? I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t know what you mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He told me all about it, Mr. Fordyce. All about that day at the track. All about what he was going to do. Bill had big ideas, Mr. Fordyce, and he thought you were his chance. Only he thought you were scared. He got too close to you, didn&#x2019;t he, Mr. Fordyce?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; he kept his voice composed, &#x201c;that you are seriously in error. I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She interrupted with a soft laugh, a laugh that did not cover an underlying cruelty. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to be as dumb as Bill was, Mr. Fordyce. I&#x2019;m not going to come anywhere within your reach. But you&#x2019;re going to pay off. You&#x2019;re going to pay off like a slot machine. A thousand dollars now and five hundred a month from now on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, but you are probably insane,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;If you are a friend of Chafey&#x2019;s, then you know he was a criminal. I am sorry for you, but there is nothing I can do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One thousand dollars by Friday, Mr. Fordyce, and five hundred a month from now on. I don&#x2019;t think you were scared when Bill went to you, but how about the gas chamber, Mr. Fordyce? How about that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What you assume is impossible.&#x201d; He fought to keep his voice controlled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s absurd to think I have that kind of money.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed again. &#x201c;But you can get it, Buster! You can get it when it means the difference between life and the gas chamber.&#x201d;<br><br>Her voice grew brusque. &#x201c;Small bills, understand? Nothing bigger than a twenty. Send it to Gertrude Ellis, Box X78, at the central office. Send me that thousand dollars by Friday and send the five hundred on the fifth of every month. If you miss by as much as ten days, the whole story goes to your girlfriend, to your boss, and to the police.&#x201d; The phone clicked, the line buzzed emptily. Slowly, Fordyce replaced the phone.<br><br>So there it was. Now he had not only disgrace and prison before him, but the gas chamber.<br><br>A single mistake&#x2014;an instant when his reason was in abeyance&#x2014;and here he was&#x2014;trapped.<br><br>He could call her bluff. He could refuse. The woman was obviously unprincipled and she had sounded vindictive. She would certainly follow through as she had threatened.<br>For hours, he paced the floor, racking his brain for some way out, some avenue of escape. He could go to Charlton, confess everything, and ask for help. Charlton would give it to him, for he was that kind of man, but when it was over, he would drop Fordyce quickly and quietly.<br><br>Alice&#x2014;his future&#x2014;everything depended on finding some other way. Some alternative.<br><br>If something should happen to this woman&#x2014; And it might. People were killed every day. There were accidents. He shied away from the idea that lay behind this, but slowly it forced its way into his consciousness. He was considering murder.<br><br>No. Never that. He would not&#x2014;he could not. He had killed Chafey, but that had been different. It had not been murder, although if all the facts were known, it might be considered so. It had been an accident. All he had done was strike out. If he killed now, deliberately and with intent, it would be different.<br><br>He ran his fingers through his hair and stared blindly at the floor. Accidentally, he caught a glimpse of his face in a mirror. He looked haggard, beaten. But he was not beaten. There was a way out. There had to be.<br><br>Morning found him on the job, working swiftly and silently. He handled the few clients who called, talked with them and straightened out their problems. He was aware that Charlton was watching him. Finally, at noon, the boss came over.<br><br>&#x201c;Fordyce,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this thing has worried you. You&#x2019;re doing a fine job this morning, so it looks as though you&#x2019;re getting it whipped, but nevertheless, I think a few days&#x2019; rest would put you right up to snuff. You just go home now, and don&#x2019;t come in until Monday. Go out of town, see a lot of Alice, anything. But relax.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; A flood of relief went over Fordyce as he got up, and genuine gratitude must have showed in his eyes, for Charlto...</p><h2>My Aunt Came Back (First Steps in Music series)</h2><p>Revisiting a folk music classic, this delightfully illustrated picture book adds an unexpected twist to a timeless song, building to a hilarious conclusion certain to engage children time and again.

Rome, the &#x201c;Eternal City,&#x201d; has long been conceived as the epitome of magnificent power imposed through military might and the force of law and as a warning of the dangers of moral corruption. The picturesque ruins of the imperial city have both fascinated and repelled, stimulating admiration for brilliant achievements by past generations and rumination on the fallibility of human desire for glory. Such images retain a hold even now in literature, art and cinema. In contrast, Jerusalem has been idealized as a holy place of revelations, miracles and spiritual intensity. The origins of these idealized images lie in the real history of these cities in the time of Jesus. At the beginning of the first millennium ce both cities were at the peak of their prosperity and grandeur, each famous throughout the Mediterranean world and beyond. They were two cities whose inhabitants came into close contact: Romans visited Jerusalem as soldiers, politicians, tourists; Jews came to Rome as suppliants, slaves or fortune-seekers. They were two cities with a culture partly shared, from the gleam of ceremonial white masonry in the summer sun to acceptance of Greek as a prestige language of the erudite and the influence of Greek architecture and philosophy. They were two cities that shared a political world fostered by friendships, alliances, patronage. But they were two cities which, as it turned out, came into conflict, with terrible results. <br><br>That a great deal can be said about both cities two thousand years ago is not entirely a matter of chance. Both Romans and Jews prized highly the art of writing, and produced large literatures. No less important, in both cases much of the literature survives to the present through a tradition of manuscript copying and preservation which was continuous from late antiquity to the Renaissance and the invention of printing. In the case of the Jews, Hebrew and Aramaic writings were preserved within the literary tradition of the rabbis, whose teachings, formulated in the first five centuries ce, laid the foundations of both medieval and modern orthodox Judaism. Jewish writings in Greek were ignored by the rabbis but preserved by Christians, who appropriated to themselves for religious edification a large number of Jewish texts composed before c.100 CE, including the&nbsp; Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, with additional material now commonly found in English Bibles as the Apocrypha), the philosophical treatises of Philo, the histories of Josephus, and Greek versions of more mystical Jewish writings originally composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. <br><br>Christians were also responsible for the preservation of much of the literature of ancient Rome. From the fourth century CE Christians adopted the literature of pagan Greece and Rome as their own. Some pagans, like the emperor Julian (ruled 361&#x2013;3), objected that Christians could not properly teach literature about the pagan gods if they did not believe in them, and the Christian St. Jerome (c. 347&#x2013;420) worried that his devotion to Ciceronian style in his Latin prose made him less devoted to his faith, but during the fifth century the great works of Greek and Latin literature came to be seen by many Christians simply as a central element in the education of Christian Romans alongside the texts composed by Christians themselves. Thus many texts survive through the pious efforts of monks, from Cassiodorus in sixth-century Italy to the industrious scholars of Byzantium as late as the fifteenth century, who saw the reproduction of manuscripts as an act of devotion, almost regardless of their contents; and from many of the pagan writings they preserved, such as Vergil&#x2019;s <i>Aeneid</i> or the philosophical musings of Seneca, Christians would in time derive appropriate moral teachings. <br><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem and Rome inevitably shared many experiences imposed upon them by the natural rhythms of the Mediterranean climate. For Jews, the Mediterranean was <i>haYam haGadol,</i> &#x201c;the Great Sea&#x201d;; <i>yama</i>, the word for &#x201c;west&#x201d; in Hebrew, reflected the view of the sea from Judaea. For the Romans, the Mediterranean was simply <i>mare nostrum</i>, &#x201c;our sea,&#x201d; rather like the English view of La Manche as the English Channel. Both cities sometimes experienced stifling heatwaves at the height of summer, although in Jerusalem, where snow is a great rarity, winters were milder than in Rome, where freezing temperatures are not unknown. Annual rainfall was less in Jerusalem than in Rome, and the summer drought, which could last from May to late November, was much longer and more complete, so that farmers in the Judaean hills relied more on the heavy dew precipitated by the sharp drop of air temperature at night. But in both cities people were all too aware of the potential effect of drought. In Jerusalem in 24 and 23 BCE drought led to food shortages and thus to plague, and to a dangerous lack of clothing in winter because flocks had died and there was &#x201c;no wool or any other material to cover themselves.&#x201d; Livy, in the time of Augustus, thought it worth including in his history of Rome the information that the year 181 BCE, nearly two centuries before, had been &#x201c;remarkable for drought and the failure of the crops. The story goes that for six months it did not rain at all.&#x201d;[1] Inhabitants of both cities imagined agricultural plenty in terms of wine, fruits and olives, grown on terraced hillsides, and pasturage, to supplement the grain crops cultivated on coastal plains and in valleys where the ground was sufficiently level for shallow ploughing. A Roman would have well understood the divine blessing that, if Israel will obey God&#x2019;s commandments, &#x201c;I will give the rain for your land in its due season, the first rain and the latter rain, so that you may gather in your grain, and your wine, and your oil. And I shall send grass in your fields for your cattle,&#x201d; and the prophet Micah looking forward to the days when &#x201c;they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid.&#x201d;[2] <br><br>But away from the sea, the ecology of Judaea was very different from anything to be found in Italy and in some ways Jerusalem lay outside the Mediterranean sphere. The distinctive geography of the land of Israel is a result of the great rift valley which runs southwards from Syria towards Africa and includes the long stretch of the Jordan valley, ending in the region of the Dead Sea, many feet below sea level. Moving eastwards from Jerusalem, the terraced hillsides rapidly gave way in antiquity to semi-desert. As the road descended towards Jericho, the wholly arid terrain was punctuated only by rare oases such as Jericho itself, En Gedi, and the spring of En Feshqa, which fed the strange community of Jews who inhabited Qumran, the site near which the Dead Sea scrolls were found. Josephus with some reason extolled the extraordinary fertility of such parts of the rift valley as could be sufficiently watered: on the borders of the Sea of Galilee, he claimed, fruit trees bore their produce continuously throughout the year.[3] <br><br>Josephus had good reason to exaggerate the prosperity of the land of Israel, both through natural patriotism and out of a desire to demonstrate the impressive feats of his patrons, the emperors Vespasian and Titus, but his geographical information can probably be trusted, and it is striking that he divided the Jewish homeland not into two, Judaea and Galilee, but into three: Judaea, Galilee and Peraea (which is Transjordan). Jewish territory looked not just west, towards the sea, and north, towards Galilee, but also east, towards the desert. The region east of the Jordan rises up to a basalt plateau made sufficiently fertile by precipitation of rain coming from the west to support a small number of cities in the Roman period&#x2014;Philadelphia (on the site of modern Amman), Jerash and Pella among others&#x2014;fed by grain production and the raising of livestock, particularly cattle. Further east still lay the semi-desert, suitable only for the grazing of sheep and goats (what the Bible called &#x201c;small cattle&#x201d;), and beyond the Peraea the Syrian desert itself, which was opening up precisely in the first century bce into a major highway for international trade from Mesopotamia. The success of the camel caravans was best illustrated by the growing prosperity of the oasis of Palmyra, the trading centre known in the biblical texts as Tadmor. It was in the Roman period, particularly in the two and a half centuries after the imposition of Roman authority in c. 17 ce, that the oasis reached the apogee of its wealth; many of the splendid tombs and temples on which the Palmyrenes lavished their wealth, favouring a curious amalgam of Parthian, Greek, semitic and Roman artistic traits, can still be seen.[4] <br><br>Links to the east mattered to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Josephus even claims, in answer to the calumny that Jews could not have had a distinguished ancient history since the ancient Greeks did not write about them, that &#x201c;ours is not a country with a sea coast; neither commerce nor the mixing which it enables with others has any attraction for us. Our cities are built inland, remote from the sea . . .&#x201d; Certainly Judaean Jews maintained close contact in the first century with their fellow Jews in Babylonia, undeterred by the fact that Babylon was ruled by Parthia, outside the sphere of Roman control. Herod the Great established in Batanaea, to the east of the Sea of Galilee, a military colony of Babylonian Jews to provide protection against brigandage for pilgrims coming to the Jerusalem Temple from Mesopotamia. According to Josephus, the first High Priest appointed by Herod after his capture of Jerusalem in 37 BCE was a certain Ananel, a Babylonian of inferior priestly origin. According to later rabbinic tradition, the great scholar Hillel, who flourished in Jerusalem in the early first century CE, also came originally from Babylon.[5] <br><br>On the other hand, if Judaea was not a wholly Mediterranean culture, neither did it easily fall into a category defined by the fertile crescent which links this region to Mesopotamia. The region shared the use of a language, Aramaic, which had originated in upper Mesopotamia and then spread to the Levant primarily through its adoption as the language of royal administration in the Persian empire during the fifth and fourth centuries BCE; but there is no evidence that inhabitants of the fertile crescent had a sense of common destiny such as was found among some communities on the shores of the Mediterranean, particularly the Greeks. Such a sense of belonging even to a smaller regional entity is not widely attested for communities in the Near East apart from the Jews until the imposition of Roman rule, and the regional identities which then emerged seem often to have been by adoption of Roman or Greek categories. During the first three centuries CE the Near East became increasingly Roman, both in the sense of a concentration of state military resources in the eastern part of the Roman empire and through the award to existing cities of the status of Roman colony, but in the early first century CE this process was still in its infancy. Viewed from the rest of the Mediterranean world, much of the fertile crescent, variously designated as Syria, Assyria or Arabia or by other exotic names, was still an undifferentiated region of little-known barbarism. To some extent, the unhappy fortune of Jerusalem under Roman rule was a result of the city&#x2019;s ambivalent position between the Mediterranean world and the Near East.[6]<br>Despite all the differences between the cultures of the two cities, a casual visitor to Rome and Jerusalem in the last decades of the first century BCE might have been more struck by similarities, since it was during these years that both cities metamorphosed from ramshackle agglomerations into shining testimonies to massive state expenditure. Rome, which up to the mid-first century BCE had been an unimpressive collection of brick buildings divided by winding alleyways, clustered around a small public area in the Forum and on the Capitoline hill, was remodelled with a series of new monumental public buildings and grand public spaces. Similarly, Jerusalem was expanded and transformed by Herod, to make it, as a Roman observer, the elder Pliny, proclaimed after its destruction in 70 CE, &#x201c;by far the most famous city of the East.&#x201d; Both cities used the most up-to-date techniques of urban planning, borrowed architectural styles from the most impressive city of the previous generation, Alexandria in Egypt, and used vaulted arches to erect platforms out from the side of hills to form level public spaces. These two ancient cities were reborn at the same time and in similar ways, but the origin of the glory of Rome was wholly different from the foundation of the splendour of Jerusalem.[7]<br><b>Rome </b><br><br>When Josephus came to Rome from Jerusalem for his brief visit in the early 60s CE he found the city at the height of its opulence. The huge, sprawling city lay on the river Tiber, near the west coast of Italy and above the plain of Latium. By the first century, the true origins of the city had long been lost from collective memory, and speculation about its mythical foundation allowed free range to the imagination of poets and historians. Already by the early part of the first millennium bce isolated villages, similar to others in the surrounding region of Latium, were in existence on the hills of the site that was to become Rome. These settlements grew in size and sophistication over the ensuing centuries, but the origins of the city as a single political unit are best dated to c.600 BCE, when the Forum was laid out as a public meeting space in the valley between the hilltops. From then to the mid-first century BCE, the power of the city grew inexorably. Incorporation of all of Latium was followed by a gradual expansion of influence over the rest of Italy. In the third century bce a long, bitter, but eventually successful struggle against the Phoenician trading city of Carthage, which lay on the north coast of Africa in modern Tunisia but also had many interests in Sicily and in Spain, left Rome in control of much of the coast of the western Mediterranean and, through use of a newly confident navy, of the sea routes between them. The conflict also left a residue of vocabulary and concepts to express hostility and contempt for a dangerous enemy, defined by their Punic language and customs as irremediably fickle. This early encounter was to have a formative effect on later Roman attitudes to barbarians from the Syrian East.<br><b>NOTES</b><br>[1] Joseph. <i>AJ</i> 15. 310; Livy 40.29.<br>[2] Deut.

Ford is a doctor of chiropractic medicine, a leader in somatic psychology, and a scholar who has taught Swahili at Columbia University and African American history at Western Washington University.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also traveled widely in Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the author of three previous books: <b>Where Healing Waters Meet: Touching Mind and Emotion Through the Body</b>; <b>Compassionate Touch: The Body's Role in Healing and Recovery</b>; and <b>We Can All Get Along: 50 Steps You Can Take to Help End Racism</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;He currently lives in Bellingham, Washington.<b>The Quest for the African Hero</b><br><br>The hero with an African face has much in common with the heroes of all ages and all lands, for the hero quest is not predicated on the particularities of place and time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply stated, the hero quest is orchestrated in three movements: a hero is called to venture forth from familiar lands into territory previously unknown; there the hero encounters marvelous forces and with magical assistance wins a decisive victory over the hindering powers of the unknown; then, with boon in hand, the hero returns to the land of his origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Departure, fulfillment, return--evidence of these three movements is uncovered in all African hero adventures.&nbsp;&nbsp;African mythology then shades the hero's career in colors of its own.<br><br>On this journey, the hero with an African face might aid us in navigating the vicissitudes of life: helping us to find strength and courage where we had thought only to find weakness and fear; to venture deeply within ourselves where we had thought only to pass lightly through our lives; to wake our gods where we had thought only to wrestle our demons.<br><br><b>The Call of Destiny</b><br><br>Uncama dug a millet garden, but when the millet had begun to ripen, a porcupine continually wasted it.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how early Uncama rose, when he arrived in his garden the porcupine had already devoured the millet.&nbsp;&nbsp;At length he waited for a day on which there was an abundance of dew.&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, he arose and said, "Today then I can follow it well, if it has eaten in the garden, for where it has gone the dew will be brushed off.&nbsp;&nbsp;At length I may discover where it has gone into its hole."<br><br>Thus begins a Zulu tale of Uncama's journey to the underworld.<br><br>Whether in life or in myth, the hero quest commences with some call or lure that wakes the hero to his destiny: an unforeseen illness may arise; a monster may appear to terrorize the countryside; a chance encounter may open a life-changing path; an unexpected animal appears whose trail the hero follows to great adventure, as in the opening of this Zulu myth.<br><br>So Uncama, with weapons in hand, embarked along the marauding porcupine's trail of dew, and upon discovering its hole, he pressed ahead, down into the depths, without further hesitation, saying, "I will go till I reach it, and kill it." Once inside the hole, Uncama passed through to the underground realm, crossing over to the land of departed souls.<br><br>Zulus are among the southernmost members of the extensive Bantu language family, which shares many beliefs, including belief in the special potency and sacred power of the subterranean realm Uncama visited.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the spirit world of departed souls referred to among the Bantu as <i>mosima,</i> which originally meant "the abyss" but has since devolved to mean simply "a hole in the ground," "a den," or "the hole of a wild animal"--hence the obvious relationship in this myth between the porcupine's hole and Uncama's arrival in this spirit land.<br><br>Uncama's curiosity and his determination to punish this animal&nbsp;&nbsp;lead him on until finally he comes to a village.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has entered a kind of purgatory, a world inhabited by departed souls yet fashioned in the image of the world of the living.<br><br>"Ho! What place is this?" he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am following the porcupine, yet I have come upon a dwelling."<br><br>At this point Uncama became fearful and he began to retreat, walking backward along the path he had thus far traversed, anxiously pondering his fate with the thought: "Let me not go to these people, for I do not know them; perhaps they will kill me."<br><br>Alas, this erstwhile traveler returns home, back through the animal portal of his adventure, to a surprised wife and community, for they had already burned his clothes and possessions, taking him for dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;And to these assembled, astonished folk he tells his tale:<br><br>"I have come from a great distance--from those who live underground.&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed a porcupine; I came to a village and heard dogs baying, children crying; I saw people moving around, the smoke from their cooking fires was rising.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I came back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was afraid, I thought they would kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>And it is because I feared and returned that you see me this day."</i><br><br>Mythological journeys of descent into the underworld of the dead are symbolic of movement from the light world of ordinary reality to the dark world of the unconscious; there, just as when we fall asleep, we die to the world of wakeful consciousness and awake to the marvelous world of evanescent forms and symbols within.&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge met by those who successfully travel these corridors of the psyche is to claim some boon or gift from this inner realm: an insight or revelation that will release the energies pent up in the labyrinths of personal or social crises; the marker of a new direction that offers reinvigoration where old ways have grown stale.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Uncama's journey, interrupted as it was by his own fear, is marked by failure of this quest; he follows the lure of the porcupine to the underworld, only to become frightened and then return.<br><br>I am reminded of a personal dream some years ago: I was fortunate to have grown up knowing my great-grandfather, with whom I was very close.&nbsp;&nbsp;He died when I was twenty, and shortly afterward I was in that half-asleep, half-awake state called hypnagogic, when I felt his presence in my bedroom and believed I could also make out his form.&nbsp;&nbsp;It scared me, and in this semiconscious state I told him to leave, which he did.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was many years before he appeared in any of my dreams again.<br><br>In the mythic realm, the terrain always rises to meet the traveler--this is the built-in safeguard of the mythic way, even for unsuspecting and unprepared wayfarers like Uncama.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventure the hero gets is precisely the one he or she is ready for.&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom is spread in front of Uncama, but he is unable to meet the requirements for entry because he has followed the porcupine's trail out of mere curiosity and anger.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero's journey is not for the faint-hearted wanderer, curious but not serious about where the journey leads, nor is it a journey to be taken in the throes of anger, but one to be relished in the spirit of high adventure.<br>Uncama's journey to the underworld, motivated by anger, is splendidly contrasted with the Ashanti tale of Kwasi Benefo's journey to Asamando, the Ashanti world of departed souls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the story of a hero whose quest is motivated out of love, suffering, and great compassion:<br><br>A young man was living among the Ashanti.&nbsp;&nbsp;His name was Kwasi Benefo.&nbsp;&nbsp;His fields flourished, he had many cattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lacked only a wife to bear children for him, to care for his household, and when the time should come, to mourn his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasi Benefo went looking.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his village he found a young woman who greatly pleased him.&nbsp;&nbsp;They married.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were content with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon the young woman faded, and death took her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasi Benefo grieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;He bought her an <i>amoasie,</i> a piece of silk-cotton cloth to cover her genitals, and beads to go around her waist, and in these things she was buried.<br><br>Kwasi Benefo could not forget her.&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked for her in his house, but she was not there.&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart was not with the living anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;His brothers spoke to him, his uncle spoke to him, his friends spoke to him, saying, "Kwasi, put it from your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way it is in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Find yourself another wife."<br>At last Kwasi Benefo comforted himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to another village.&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a young woman there and made arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought her home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again he became contented with living.&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman had a good character.&nbsp;&nbsp;She took good care of the household.&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried in every way to please her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasi Benefo said, "Yes, living is worthwhile." But after she had been pregnant for some time, the young woman became ill.&nbsp;&nbsp;She grew gaunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Death took her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasi Benefo's heart hurt him.&nbsp;&nbsp;This wife, too, was buried in her <i>amoasie</i> and beads.<br><br>Kwasi Benefo could not be consoled.&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not come out.&nbsp;&nbsp;People said to him, "People have died before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, come out of your house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingle with your friends as you used to do." But Kwasi Benefo did not desire life anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;He remained in his house.<br><br>The family of the young woman who had died heard about Kwasi Benefo's grief.&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, "He is suffering too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;This man loved our daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us give him another wife." They sent messengers to Kwasi Benefo, and they brought him to their village.&nbsp;&nbsp;They said to him, "One must grieve, yes, but you cannot give your life to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have another daughter, she will make a good wife for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take her.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way you will not be alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is past is past, one cannot go there anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a man has loved is in his heart, it does not go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the dead live with the dead, and the living with the living."<br><br>Embedded in these words of consolation to a distraught Kwasi Benefo are references to Akan (the language family of the Ashanti) sacred wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as with the Bantu, the Ashanti believe that the dead inhabit a world that is a mirror image of the world of the living, only underground; in this world, death happens in stages over several generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the name of a departed ancestor can be called, that ancestor is not dead in some final sense of the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;These unseen ancestors (called <i>nsamanfo</i> in Akan) can, then, be forces in the lives of the living, and in dreams or states of deep reverie, the spirit of a living individual (<i>sunsum</i>) can convene with these <i>nsamanfo.</i><br><br>Kwasi Benefo felt the presence of his wife who had passed into the world of the ancestors:<br><br>"Now, how can I take another wife when the one who has died calls to me?"<br><br>They answered, "Yes, that is the way a person feels.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in time it will be different."<br><br>In time it was different for Kwasi Benefo, who returned to his home and his fields; eventually the pain of his wife's death lessened, and he went back to the village of her family seeking the daughter whose hand in marriage they had so graciously offered him.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were wedded, and she bore a fine son whose birth was feted throughout Kwasi Benefo's village.<br><br>"My life is good," Kwasi Benefo told his wife and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;"When has it ever been so good?"<br><br>One day while Kwasi Benefo was tending his crops, some village women hurried to him with news that a tree had fallen.<br><br>"Who cries over a falling tree?" he thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then darkness covered his spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Is there something left unspoken?"<br><br>They said, "Your wife was coming back from the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat beneath the tree to rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;A spirit of the woods weakened the roots, and the tree fell on her." Kwasi Benefo ran to the village.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife lay upon her mat without life in her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasi Benefo cried out.&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw himself on the ground and lay there as if life had departed from him also.&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard nothing, felt nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;People said, "Kwasi Benefo is dead." The medicine men came.&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, "No, he is not dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lingers between here and there." They worked on Kwasi Benefo.&nbsp;&nbsp;They revived him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up.&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the arrangements that were necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wake, and the next day his wife was buried in her <i>amoasie</i> and beads.<br><br>After this Kwasi Benefo plunged into deep despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;What evil fate had visited his life? What woman would want to be married to him? What family would entrust their daughter to him? Even his friends began to look at him with suspicion.&nbsp;&nbsp;His cattle, his crops, even his son--what meaning did they have for him after all this tragedy and loss?<br><br>He abandoned his house, he abandoned his farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried his son to the place where his wife's family lived and left him there.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out into the bush.&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked for many days, not caring where he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived at a distant village, but he departed from it at once and went deeper into the bush.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, at a wild place, he stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "This place, far from people, I will stay here." He built a crude house.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathered roots and seeds to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;He made traps for small game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothing turned to rags, and he began to wear the skins of animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;In time he almost forgot that his name was Kwasi Benefo and that he had once been a prosperous farmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;His life was wretched, but he did not care.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way it was with Kwasi Benefo.<br><br>These were the "forest years" of Kwasi Benefo's self-enforced exile.&nbsp;&nbsp;This earnest man has misread the signposts of his life, interpreting his great pain and suffering as a direction to quit the world, renounce all material possessions, and retreat to the life of an ascetic recluse.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this hero's journey does not end here:<br><br>After several years passed, Kwasi Benefo reemerged from his forest seclusion and traveled to a distant village where he was unknown; there he began to farm again and married for a fourth time.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when his fourth wife fell ill and died, Kwasi Benefo's will was broken.<br><br>"How can I go on living?" He abandoned his farm, his house, and his cattle, and he journeyed back to the village where he was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;People were surprised because they had thought he was dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;His family and his friends gathered to celebrate his return, but Kwasi Benefo said, "No, there is to be no celebration.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come back only to die in my own village and be buried here near the graves of my ancestors."<br><br>This is the turning point of the whole adventure, for once Kwasi Benefo lets go of willing how his life should unfold, a way opens for him to receive a great boon, born of the pain and suffering he has so desperately wished to escape.<br><br>One night as he lay sleepless, the thought came to him that he should go to Asamando, the land of the dead, and see the four young women who had shared his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;He arose.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went out of his house and departed from his village.&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the forest place called Nsamandow, where the dead were buried.&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached it; he went on.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no paths to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no light.&nbsp;&nbsp;All was darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed through the forest and came to a place of di...</p><h2>S is for Sunflower: A Kansas Alphabet (Discover America State by State)</h2><p>Nicknamed the "world's breadbasket," the contributions from the great state of Kansas reverberate far beyond its borders.

"Cat Daddy," isn't what you might expect for a cat expert&nbsp;(as <i>The New York Times</i> noted, with his goatee and tattoos, he "looks like a Hells Angel"). Yet Galaxy's ability to connect with even the most troubled felines -- not to mention the stressed-out humans living in their wake&nbsp;-- is awe-inspiring. In this book, Galaxy tells the poignant story of his thirteen-year relationship with a petite gray-and-white short-haired cat named Benny, and gives singular advice for living with, caring for, and loving the feline in your home.<br><br>When Benny arrived in his life, Galaxy was a down-and-out rock musician with not too much more going on than a part-time job at an animal shelter and a drug problem. Benny's previous owner brought the cat to the shelter in a cardboard box to give him up. Benny had seen better days --- his pelvis had just been shattered by the wheels of a car -- and his owner insisted he'd been "unbondable" from day one. Nothing could have been further from the truth. An inspiring account of two broken beings who fixed each other, <i>Cat Daddy</i> is laced throughout with Galaxy's amazing "Cat Mojo" advice for understanding what cats need most from us humans in order to live happier, healthier lives.</p></p><p><b>Jackson Galaxy<i> </i></b>has been called everything from a cat trainer to a cat shrink. Drawing on his years of experience in animal shelters and as a consultant working one-on-one with thousands of cats in their homes, his unique "Cat Mojo" approach offers people a deeper understanding of why their cats act out in the ways they do. Galaxy maintains a private consulting practice in Los Angeles.<br> "Galaxy's candor earns the reader's trust...he seamlessly weaves his relationship with Benny into the larger story of his life and recovery, which will appeal to a readership beyond cat lovers." --Publishers Weekly <br> "Mr. Galaxy--shaved head, arms full of tattoos--seems physically at odds with his gentle voice and gentle approach to animals.... But though he may be dealing with humans who have been terrorized and even bloodied by their out-of-control pets, he's a model of consistency. The cats, not the people, are his No. 1 priority." --The New York Times <br> "Galaxy is not your average animal behaviorist. He speaks Cat. And cats listen. He works miracles in saving death-row cats in shelters by helping them get over their fears and increase their self-esteem, and coaching them to 'work it' with potential adopters." --mousebreath.com <br> "There's an undeniable authenticity that comes through in "Cat Daddy;" its confessional nature and raw, often lyrical, prose are sure to resonate with a broad audience."--Modern Cat <br> "He's the kind of magic man who can lull a shelter's roomful of ferocious felines to sleep." --Yahoo! <br> "Each of us sheds light on our subject from our own particular point of view. Fortunately for us all Jackson Galaxy's light is very bright. His success at resolving behavioral difficulties in cats stems from his ability to slide his mind into the cat's point of view and proceed from there. His insights into both human and cat behavior are right on." --Anitra Frazier, author of "The Natural Cat" <br> "A joy.... Sometimes the biggest stories are actually the smallest ones--one man, one cat, and a quiet love that was large enough to save them both." --Gwen Cooper, "New York"" Times "bestselling author of "Homer's Odyssey "and "Love Saves the Day" <br> "This book is no ordinary cat memoir, nor is it an ordinary cat advice book. It is an inspirational tour de force that offers an intimate glimpse at Jackson, the man, and Jackson, the Cat Daddy." --Ingrid King, award-winning author of "Buckley's Story: Lessons from a Feline Master Teacher" <br> "The book will take you on a roller coaster of emotions -- anger, frustration, sadness, joy -- and will teach you a lot about cats along the way.... ["Cat Daddy"] contains stories of love, healing and the intense joy that comes with finding your higher purpose. It is a must-read for animal lovers, rescue workers, lost souls and anyone who has been touched by a cat in their life." --CatChannel.com <br> "With his goatee and tattoos, not to mention his custom-lined guitar-case-turned-pet-supply-kit, Galaxy might not seem like a typical 'cat person' -- but who better than a New Yorker inked with images of cats and his own set of whiskers to mediate between a fussy feline and its guardian?" --New York Post <br> "At first glance, Jackson Galaxy is the quintessential, bearded, tattooed L.A. hipster musician type with a laid back tone and a mellow voice; but scratch the surface and you'll find a 45-year-old, Jewish New Yorker who happens to love and understand cats like no other." --Layla Morgan Wilde, The Boomer Muse blog<br> <br></p><h2>W.I.T.C.H.: The Graphic Novel, Part III.

As a text, this book is a good fit for courses on professional ethics, risk management, and establishing a professional practice--students will want to keep it at hand long after graduation."--Allan E. Barsky, JD, MSW, PhD, School of Social Work, Florida Atlantic University; Former Chair, National Ethics Committee, National Association of Social Workers<br><br> "This soup-to-nuts guide to opening and operating a therapeutic practice is a 'must read' for every mental health clinician. For the solo practitioner or small office, the sample forms for every conceivable clinical and business issue from intake to termination are a terrific benefit of this absorbing book. And every clinician should read and periodically reread the excellent chapter on ethics and malpractice. If you have an office manager, that person needs this book. If you have this book, you may not need an office manager."--James Morrison, MD, Affiliate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Oregon Health and Science University<br><br> "Private practice involves a great deal of hard work, planning, and foresight. This book does a remarkable job of covering the broad range of concerns related to maintaining a practice based on sound risk management strategies plus current HIPAA regulations. Not only do the authors share ideas garnered from other experienced practitioners, but they also offer a wealth of reproducible forms and abundant supporting references. The fifth edition aptly addresses current technological advances, insurance complexities, and general consumer litigiousness. A 'must have' for anyone engaged in private practice."--Ann A. Abbott, PhD, LCSW, past president, National Association of Social Workers; retired Professor and Chair of Graduate Social Work, West Chester University<br><br> "When I was training to be a therapist, I studied theory, psychopathology, and treatment--but not the nuts and bolts of running a practice. I learned the rules and policies that guide a successful practice 'on the job,' and it took a long time. The fifth edition of this amazing book contains all the essential information that I wish I had learned during my formal education. It includes expert guidance for therapists working in an environment dominated by social media. This is the ideal text for a practice-based class or one focused on professional issues, and serves as the seminal reference for therapists in private practice."--JoEllen Patterson, PhD, Department of Counseling and Marital and Family Therapy, University of San Diego<br><br>"This excellent book covers all the relevant issues involved in starting and maintaining a private practice....This book should be in the hands of all private practitioners, whether newly graduated or seasoned veterans.&#x201d;, <i>Doody's Review Service</i> Published On: 2017-03-10<br><br>&#x201c;Should be among the most well-thumbed works in the library of virtually anyone in independent practice....Thoughtful perusal of and decision-making based on this volume's detailed, inclusive, carefully crafted information should well equip mental health practitioners to establish or update sound and effective practice procedures and materials.

YOU are a beautiful, blessed being. The energy that animates your body, that moves the air in and out of your lungs, that arises in your mind as impulses and desires, and that is expressed through your unique interests and talents&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the energy that flows through every aspect of your body and mind is the same energy that governs the process of all creation&#x2014;whether the creation of a single cell or an entire universe. By whatever name you call it&#x2014;life force, Mother Nature, Spirit, source, or God&#x2014;you are an extension of this powerful force. You are the furthermost tangible expression of it, in fact: a divine being living in a seemingly material world.<br> <br>You have arrived here, at this particular juncture in time, with all of your particular characteristics and circumstances, for the purpose of realizing your own divinity. You are here to experience the fullness of your power, to make manifest your heart&#x2019;s desires, and to create a magnificent life that continues to surprise and delight not just you, but everyone in your personal and professional realm.<br> <br>Although you have taken form as a human being who is temporarily focusing through your unique body and this particular lifetime, you are not separate from the energy that created you, from the energy that creates worlds. You come from the same source from which all things arise, and to which all things return. You are part of the ocean of consciousness that contains everything, and you are here to allow your life&#x2019;s journey to guide you along a unique and winding path. And once that path has reached its fullest expression and farthest expansion, the essence of you will rise like rain evaporating back into the clouds, and the river of your life will merge into and again become one with the broader ocean.<br> <br>While you are here in this lifetime, you will be called by many streams of interest, and each one of them will provide you an opportunity to flow your energy and your love. Your career is one such tributary&#x2014;one that holds unlimited potential for inspiration, expansion, contribution, abundance, and, quite frankly, the most thrilling ride of your life.<br> <br>Your career is a living, breathing, evolving manifestation that has the potential to contract, stagnate, wither, and die, or to grow, blossom, expand, and thrive. In the same way that a child, a lover, a pet, or even a houseplant is responsive to the quality of attention you focus upon it, this aspect of your life responds to and will reflect back to you the quality of energy you give to it. This book will guide you through each stage of this becoming&#x2014;from the earliest conception of the vision in the inner world of your imagination and emotions, to its full manifestation in the external world of form and phenomenon. And once you have brought into full fruition the vision of your ideal career as you can right now conceive it, this book will show you how to periodically re-create that vision so that it continues to fulfill your ever-evolving desires.<br> <br>Your career is a living, breathing, evolving manifestation that has the potential to contract, stagnate, wither, and die, or to grow, blossom, expand, and thrive.<br> <br>Growing your career into a perfect manifestation of all that you want it to be is a process of bringing all aspects of yourself into resonance with the energy of what you want to create. You do this by first identifying the emotional, vibrational essence of who you want to be and how you want to feel in the area of your creative expression, and then by bringing your vibration&#x2014;meaning the sum total of your dominant thoughts, feelings, moods, and emotions&#x2014;into energetic harmony with that vision. Said another way, in order to create outrageous abundance in your career, you first have to become a vibrational match to the energy of abundance. If the energy you offer in relation to your career is one of anxiety or frustration, you will unwittingly hold apart from yourself the abundance you&#x2019;re seeking. In this book, I will show you how to purposefully adjust your energy so the vibration you are sending out is consistent with the success you desire. When that shift occurs, you will no longer find yourself striving for success. Rather, success&#x2014;in all its forms&#x2014;will pursue you.<br> <br>When I was first introduced to the principles of deliberate creation nearly twenty years ago, the circumstances of my life were far from how I wanted them to be. I was thirty pounds overweight and nearly $60,000 in debt. I wanted to get married and start a family, but had a knack for consistently attracting the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; kind of men. I worked at a job I hated and lived in an ant-infested room that I rented in someone else&#x2019;s home because I could not afford my own apartment.<br> <br>Wanting very much to transform my life, which felt at the time like a constant uphill struggle, I devoted all my nights and nearly every weekend to studying the principles that I&#x2019;ll be sharing with you throughout this book. I learned about the nonphysical forces&#x2014;such as polarity, clarity, alignment, resonance, momentum, and magnetism&#x2014;that coalesce and join together to create and organize everything we experience in our physical, manifested world, from the degree of health and vitality we feel in our bodies, to the circumstances of where we live, to the level of success we realize in all our endeavors. And then, determined to test the accuracy of all that I&#x2019;d learned, I decided to apply these principles to the conditions of my own life&#x2014;and my career (or, more accurately at the time, my lack thereof) offered the perfect environment to conduct these experiments. I began a daily practice of meditating, visualizing, magnetizing, and connecting with the energy of success, in order to determine the outer effects of these internal practices.<br> <br>Over the course of the next five years, I went to work for a series of companies&#x2014;and each new position I accepted offered a higher salary, more benefits, better working conditions, and greater freedom. A couple of years into my &#x201c;experiment,&#x201d; I decided to pursue a career as a pharmaceutical sales representative, and eventually accepted a position with Janssen Pharmaceutica, where I became the number-one rep in my district. Everything I had intended was unfolding more easily and abundantly than I could possibly have imagined. And when at the peak of this newfound success I was asked to resign from that position, I trusted that the universe had better things in store for me, and immersed myself even deeper in my metaphysical practices. I was beginning to understand that by holding steady to my vision and aligning with the essence of what I wanted, I would eventually call that reality into my experience. And that&#x2019;s exactly what happened.<br> <br>After being asked to resign my position as a pharmaceutical sales rep, I didn&#x2019;t work for more than three months, yet, amazingly, made more money than when I was working full-time. Thanks to a generous severance package, some unexpected bonuses, and windfalls that seemed to come out of nowhere, hardly a day went by that I didn&#x2019;t receive a check in the mail. During that three-month period, I also wrote my first book, Perfect Pictures, and when it came out and I began promoting it, the VP at the new company I&#x2019;d started working for invited me to do a book signing at one of their national conferences.<br> <br>I was happier than I&#x2019;d been in years. I loved my coworkers and my customers, and although I was still relatively new to the field, I was entrusted with a very big territory. Soon I was making so much money in commissions that the company had to instate a policy to cap the monthly income of its sales force! After this occurred, a job recruiter I&#x2019;d never hired called me offering a position that was even more ideal than the one I was in&#x2014;with no caps on bonuses, a smaller and therefore more manageable territory, and a product that was easier to sell and more in line with my values.<br> <br>I continued applying these universal principles, and everything in my life kept getting better and better. When statements from the Social Security Administration came in the mail that showed the dramatic increase in my income, it was incredibly empowering to see the tangible evidence of my expanding abundance. When I began my experiment, I was earning $32,000 a year. And when I decided to leave corporate America to start my own coaching practice so I could teach others all that I was learning, that number had skyrocketed to $186,000. In case you&#x2019;re wondering, it&#x2019;s grown by almost a full zero since then.<br> <br>In this book, I&#x2019;ll share the success principles I&#x2019;ve applied since the very beginning&#x2014;first to become increasingly successful in my sales career, then to launch my coaching business, and finally to support its exponential growth. I&#x2019;ll walk you through the proven formula I&#x2019;ve developed as a result of more than twenty years of studying, experimenting with, and applying the universal forces that govern all manifestation, and show you how to harness it to create or re-create a career expression that is ideal for you in every imaginable way. I&#x2019;ll show you how to establish an inner relationship with future clients, associates, and employees long before you ever meet them; how to work with light and energy to magnetize the opportunities and resources that will contribute to your success; and how to create a culture of value and appreciation around you that brings out the very best in everyone you come in contact with.<br> <br>You were born with great purpose, and when you allow yourself to align with&#x2014;rather than resist, contradict, or deny&#x2014;that purpose, you thrive in every possible way. Quantum success is the natural consequence of this alignment. It is a state of appreciating all that we have created, even as we recognize that we are in the process of creating so much more.<br> <br>You were born with great purpose, and when you allow yourself to align with&#x2014;rather than resist, contradict, or deny&#x2014;that purpose, you thrive in every possible way.<br> <br>Quantum success is not the result of hard work alone, of effort or struggle. Rather, it unfolds naturally and exponentially once we learn how to harness the power and energy of the universe. It is the kind of success that is created from the inside out. Each of us will define quantum success in our own terms, according to our own values, unique interests, and goals. But regardless of what it looks like on the outside, it is always marked by an internal experience of happiness, joy, vitality, aliveness, and unlimited abundance.<br> <br>While some may regard a desire for this type of success as superficial or materialistic, success that arises from a state of inner alignment is a deeply spiritual pursuit, because the only way to attain it is by deciding to use this lifetime to realize the fullness of your divinity, your power, and your ability to create. You are in a continual process of becoming, and by consciously choosing who you want to be and what you want to create in the area of your career and self-expression, you accelerate this evolution.<br> <br>No matter where you are right now&#x2014;whether you&#x2019;re actively seeking to work your way up the corporate ladder, or you&#x2019;re reevaluating your current career path; whether you have aspirations that you don&#x2019;t yet know how to achieve, or you&#x2019;re the head of your own thriving business and are ready to create even more success with greater ease&#x2014;the process outlined in this book will help you to determine with greater clarity what you now want to create, who you want to become in the process of creating it, and how to align yourself on every level with that vision.<br> <br>If you desire to find and express the essence of who you are; if you are ready to allow yourself to move with clarity and momentum along the river that is your life; if you are eager to experience the exaltation, abundance, and joyful motion forward that is naturally produced from a state of internal alignment, this book will be your guide.</p><h2>Living in the Woods in a Tree: Remembering Blaze Foley (Volume 2) (North Texas Lives of Musician Series)</h2><p>Now an Independent Film<br><br> With a new Foreword by Ethan Hawke, Director of <i>BLAZE</i><br> With a new Afterword by the author<br><br><i>Living in the Woods in a Tree</i> is an intimate glimpse into the turbulent life of Texas music legend Blaze Foley (1949&#x2013;1989), seen through the eyes of Sybil Rosen, the woman for whom he wrote his most widely known song, &#x201c;If I Could Only Fly.&#x201d; It captures the exuberance of their fleeting idyll in a tree house in the Georgia woods during the countercultural 1970s. Rosen offers a firsthand witnessing of Foley&#x2019;s transformation from a reticent hippie musician to the enigmatic singer/songwriter who would live and die outside society's rules. While Foley's own performances are only recently being released, his songs have been covered by Merle Haggard, Lyle Lovett, and John Prine. When he first encountered &#x201c;If I Could Only Fly,&#x201d; Merle Haggard called it &#x201c;the best country song I've heard in fifteen years.&#x201d;<br><br> In a work that is part-memoir, part-biography, Rosen struggles to finally come to terms with Foley's myth and her role in its creation. Her tracing of his impact on her life navigates a lovers' roadmap along the permeable boundary between life and death. A must-read for all Blaze Foley and Texas music fans, as well as romantics of all ages, <i>Living in the Woods in a Tree</i> is an honest and compassionate portrait of the troubled artist and his reluctant muse.</p><p>Sybil Rosen was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and holds a BFA from the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. A screenwriter and playwright, she has won many awards. A short documentary for which she wrote the narration was nominated for an Academy Award in that category, and while she wrote for the TV show <i>Guiding Light</i>, it won an Emmy for best writing. She currently lives in Whitesburg, Georgia.&#x201c;Thumbs up!&#x201d;&#x2014;Merle Haggard<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Living in the Woods in a Tree</i> comes at a time when music fans are hungry to know more about Blaze Foley. There are no books that compete with Rosen&#x2019;s, and it&#x2019;s quite unlikely that any ever will. Rosen&#x2019;s time with him (and her deft telling of that time) reveals so much about the man and the music.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter Cooper, <i>The Tennessean</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Poetic and gripping, this beautifully written book ends up being about Blaze, the author, the times, and the creative journey. This book will appeal to anyone who enjoys strong writing and great story telling, who is interested in Blaze Foley or Texas music. An impressive work in every way!&#x201d;&#x2014;Louis Black, editor, <i>Austin Chronicle</i> and executive producer of <i>Be Here to Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt</i><br><br> "Most people live their life in quiet desperation, and usually indoors. Mr. Foley blazed the outdoors and made the rest of us unique. A rare book about a rare being."--Colonel Bruce Hampton<br><br>"More famous dead than alive, Blaze Foley continues growing in legend. . . . Romantic without being cloying, <i>Living in the Woods in a Tree</i> is perhaps the most complete vision of the Duct Tape Messiah as we're likely to get, and Rosen portrays a complex, confounding subject with a simplicity and seductiveness that's all too rare."--<i>Austin Chronicle</i><br><br>"A much-liked character on the Austin, Texas, music scene in the 1970s and '80s, he was shot dead at 39. Though his recorded output is scarce, his influence remains large. His friend Lucinda Williams wrote a song about him--"Drunken Angel"--as did Townes Van Zandt. Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and others have covered his songs."--<i>New York Post</i><br><br>"In her work--mostly memoir, part biography--Rosen struggles to come to terms with Foley's myth and her role in its creation. She offers a firsthand account of his transformation from a reticent hippie musician to the enigmatic singer-songwriter who'd live and die outside society's rules."--<i>Texas Music</i></p><h2>Sweet Vengeance: A Novel of Resilience and Revenge</h2><p><b>THE TRUTH WILL RISE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Tessa Jamison couldn&#x2019;t have imagined anything worse than losing her beloved twin girls and husband&#x2014;until she was convicted of their murder.

The more we learn about what other animals think and do, they explain, the more we understand ourselves as animals, too. Writes Montgomery, &#x201c;The list of attributes once thought to be unique to our species&#x2015;from using tools to waging war&#x2015;is not only rapidly shrinking, but starting to sound less and less impressive when we compare them with other animals&#x2019; powers.&#x201d;</p> <p>With humor, empathy, and introspection, Montgomery and Thomas look into the lives of all kinds of creatures&#x2015;from man&#x2019;s best friend to the great white shark&#x2015;and examine the ways we connect with our fellow species. Both authors have devoted their lives to sharing the animal kingdom&#x2019;s magic with others, and their combined wisdom is an indispensable contribution to the field of animal literature.</p> <p>The book contains a foreword by Vicki Constantine Croke, author of the bestseller&nbsp;<em>Elephant Company</em>.</p></p><p><p> Researching articles, films, and her twenty-one books for adults and children, bestselling author Sy Montgomery has been chased by an angry silverback gorilla in Rwanda, hunted by a tiger in India, and swum with piranhas, electric eels, and pink dolphins in the Amazon. Her work has taken her from the cloud forest of Papua New Guinea (for a book on tree kangaroos) to the Altai Mountains of the Gobi (for another on snow leopards.) Her books for adults include The Soul of an Octopus (a National Book Award finalist), The Good Good Pig, Birdology, Spell of the Tiger, Journey of the Pink Dolphins, and Walking with the Great Apes. She lives in New Hampshire with her husband, the writer Howard Mansfield, their border collie, Thurber, and their flock of free-range laying hens. </p> <p> One of the most widely read authors on anthropology and animals wild and domestic, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas has observed dogs, cats, elephants, and human animals during her half-century-long career, all of which was inspired by her lengthy trips to Africa as a young woman. Her many books include Dreaming of Lions, The Hidden Life of Dogs, The Social Lives of Dogs, The Tribe of Tiger, The Old Way, and The Hidden Life of Deer. She lives in Peterborough, New Hampshire. </p><p><strong><em>Library Journal-</em></strong></p> <p>"Best-selling authors and best friends, naturalists Montgomery (<em>The Soul of an Octopus</em>) and Thomas (<em>The Hidden Life of Dogs</em>), partner on this engaging collection adapted from their joint columns from <em>The Boston Globe</em>. The essays explore the minds, lives, intelligence, and mysteries of wild and domestic animals. Both have spent most of their lives studying and researching animal behavior and share a worldview that questions a human-centric sense of superiority, as reflected in their insightful essays. Some impressions come from their respective New Hampshire surroundings, which include their own dogs and cats, deer, mice, chickens, slugs, and worms. They also share observations of animals seen on their various international research trips including pink dolphins, lions, hyenas, and hyraxes (a small African mammal). Reflections on love among octopuses, the death of a dog, and a visit from a Christmas ermine are quietly eloquent. <strong>VERDICT:</strong> Armchair and active naturalists will enjoy and learn from the authors&#x2019; enlightened perceptions on the intricate relationship between humans and animals in this thought-provoking collection."</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In their writing and in their lives and in their remarkable friendship, Liz and Sy break down false barriers and carry us closer to our fellow creatures.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;from the foreword by Vicki Constantine Croke, author of&nbsp;<em>Elephant Company</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Two kindred spirits treat animals as they ought to be treated, with understanding, knowledge, and humor.

But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extend suffering.<br>Gawande, a practicing surgeon, addresses his profession's ultimate limitation, arguing that quality of life is the desired goal for patients and families. Gawande offers examples of freer, more socially fulfilling models for assisting the infirm and dependent elderly, and he explores the varieties of hospice care to demonstrate that a person's last weeks or months may be rich and dignified.<br>Full of eye-opening research and riveting storytelling, Being Mortal asserts that medicine can comfort and enhance our experience even to the end, providing not only a good life but also a good end.<br><br></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> True or false: Modern medicine is a miracle that has transformed all of our lives.</p> <p>If you said &#x201c;true,&#x201d; you&#x2019;d be right, of course, but that&#x2019;s a statement that demands an asterisk, a &#x201c;but.&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine,&#x201d; writes Atul Gawande, a surgeon (at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital in Boston) and a writer (at the New Yorker). &#x201c;We think. . .[it] is to ensure health and survival. But really. . .it is to enable well-being. And well-being is about the reasons one wishes to be alive.&#x201d; Through interviews with doctors, stories from and about health care providers (such as the woman who pioneered the notion of &#x201c;assisted living&#x201d; for the elderly)&#x2014;and eventually, by way of the story of his own father&#x2019;s dying, Gawande examines the cracks in the system of health care to the aged (i.e. 97 percent of medical students take no course in geriatrics) and to the seriously ill who might have different needs and expectations than the ones family members predict. (One striking example: the terminally ill former professor who told his daughter that &#x201c;quality of life&#x201d; for him meant the ongoing ability to enjoy chocolate ice cream and watch football on TV. If medical treatments might remove those pleasures, well, then, he wasn&#x2019;t sure he would submit to such treatments.) Doctors don&#x2019;t listen, Gawande suggests&#x2014;or, more accurately, they don&#x2019;t know what to listen for. (Gawande includes examples of his own failings in this area.) Besides, they&#x2019;ve been trained to want to find cures, attack problems&#x2014;to win. But victory doesn&#x2019;t look the same to everyone, he asserts. Yes, &#x201c;death is the enemy,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don&#x2019;t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don&#x2019;t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee... someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; In his compassionate, learned way, Gawande shows all of us&#x2014;doctors included&#x2014;how mortality must be faced, with both heart and mind. &#x2013; <i>Sara Nelson</i></p><b>Atul Gawande</b> is author of four bestselling books: <i>Complications</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award; <i>Better</i>, selected by Amazon as one of the ten best books of 2007; <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i>; and his most recent, <i>Being Mortal</i>.

Schulz&#x2019;s cartooning has never been more expressive, and his sense of humor never more unencumbered by formula or tradition. In one sequence, the gang waits... and waits... for a school bus that never comes. Another shockingly showcases Charlie Brown hitting a game-winning home run &#x2015; off Roy Hobbs&#x2019; great-granddaughter? Then, Linus lobbies the White House to nominate Snoopy for a Supreme Court seat (it would go to Ruth Bader Ginsburg). Woodstock discovers his long-lost grandfather&#x2019;s diary, detailing a hard life in captivity (birdcage). Snoopy lands in the hospital with pneumonia, and all three of his brothers &#x2015; Andy, Spike, and Olaf &#x2015; come pay their respects. This is the 22nd volume (of 25) of the bestselling series collecting every single one of the 18,000-plus strips created by Schulz from 1950-2000</p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.&#x201c;I am genuinely thrilled that this series has reached the 1990s, which I consider one of Charles Schulz's artistic peaks, with his poignantly shaky line and boldly irreverent storylines invigorating the timeless strip.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jake Austen, <em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Schulz&#x2019;s cartooning is still excellent here, the facial expressions telling, the choreography of his characters elegant. ... In this latest collection it&#x2019;s pure pleasure to savor a true master writing and drawing a few years before his death. Schulz&#x2019;s work didn&#x2019;t decline &#x2015; the culture simply sped up and forgot to look back.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dana Jennings, <em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;These timeless strips are sure to bring a smile to your face....If you could use a relaxing, funny way to end the day,&nbsp;<em>The Complete Peanuts 1993 to 1994</em>&nbsp;makes for good bedtime reading!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Glenn Perrett, <em>Metroland Media</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The volume covering 1993 and 1994 still has plenty of good ideas and great gags. Schulz is at his best when doing stories about baseball. It's Charlie Brown at his purest, as an idealist and optimist who never stops trying, no matter how many times he's failed. ... The strips set at camp are always strong, but the series where Snoopy's in the hospital were unusually touching.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rob Clough, <em>High-Low</em></strong></p><h2>All the Way to America: The Story of a Big Italian Family and a Little Shovel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;This immigration story is universal.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i>, Starred</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Dan Yaccarino&#x2019;s great-grandfather arrived at Ellis Island with a small shovel and his parents&#x2019; good advice: &#x201c;Work hard, but remember to enjoy life, and never forget your family.&#x201d; With simple text and warm, colorful illustrations, Yaccarino recounts how the little shovel was passed down through four generations of this Italian-American family&#x2014;along with the good advice.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a story that will have kids asking their parents and grandparents: Where did <i>we</i> come from?

Meanwhile, inequalities in education, housing, health care, and the job market continue to prevail, while increased insecurity and fear have led to an epidemic of scapegoating and harassment of people of color. Yet, recent polls show that only thirty-one percent of white people in the United States believe racism is a major societal problem; at the same time, resistance is strong, as highlighted by indigenous struggles for land and sovereignty and the Movement for Black Lives. </p><p> Completely revised and updated, this fourth edition of <em> Uprooting Racism </em> offers a framework around neoliberalism and interpersonal, institutional, and cultural racism, along with stories of resistance and white solidarity. It provides practical tools and advice on how white people can work as allies for racial justice, engaging the reader through questions, exercises, and suggestions for action, and includes a wealth of information about specific cultural groups such as Muslims, people with mixed heritage, Native Americans, Jews, recent immigrants, Asian Americans, and Latino/as. </p><p> Previous editions of <em> Uprooting Racism </em> have sold more than 50,000 copies.

In this evocative and lavishly illustrated narrative, Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan delve into the history of the park idea, from the first sighting by white men in 1851 of the valley that would become Yosemite and the creation of the world&#x2019;s first national park at Yellowstone in 1872, through the most recent additions to a system that now encompasses nearly four hundred sites and 84 million acres. <br><br>The authors recount the adventures, mythmaking, and intense political battles behind the evolution of the park system, and the enduring ideals that fostered its growth. They capture the importance and splendors of the individual parks: from Haleakala in Hawaii to Acadia in Maine, from Denali in Alaska to the Everglades in Florida, from Glacier in Montana to Big Bend in Texas. And they introduce us to a diverse cast of compelling characters&#x2014;both unsung heroes and famous figures such as John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, and Ansel Adams&#x2014;who have been transformed by these special places and committed themselves to saving them from destruction so that the rest of us could be transformed as well. <br><br><i>The National Parks</i> is a glorious celebration of an essential expression of American democracy.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Joseph J.

Read Ellis's exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>The National Parks: America's Best Idea</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>If Ken Burns&#x2019;s upcoming documentary film on America&#x2019;s National Parks is as good as the book laying open before me, he has another huge winner. Of course the book, entitled <em>The National Parks: America&#x2019;s Best Idea</em>, is intended as a companion to the film, but as I see it--literally--the book permits the eye and mind to linger over the truly breathtaking pictures in a more meditative way that film does not allow. The result is almost elegiac, producing the same kind of goose bumps that Burns created in his early work on the Brooklyn Bridge and the Civil War.</p> <p>Burns has been chronicling the American experience for over thirty years, and I think it&#x2019;s fair to say that no one has influenced more living Americans to think about our history as a people and a nation. His dominant themes have been space and race, his persistent question deceptively simple: who are we? I think <em>The National Parks</em> is his masterpiece on the space theme. And the message that kept whispering to me in these pages was that whoever we are has been decisively shaped by the sheer physicality of the continent we inhabit.</p> <p>It never occurred to me before, but Americans invented the idea institutionalized in our National Parks. Namely, as Burns puts it in the introduction, &#x201c;for the first time in human history, land--great sections of our natural landscape--was set aside, not for kings or noblemen or the very rich, but for everyone, for all time.&#x201d; As Wallace Stegner once observed, and the book&#x2019;s subtitle echoes, this may have been &#x201c;America&#x2019;s best idea.&#x201d; Burns links the idea to Jefferson&#x2019;s magic words in the Declaration of Independence (i.e. &#x201c;We hold these truths...&#x201d;), our quasi-sacred text on human freedom, which takes on an almost spiritual resonance amidst the vistas of Yosemite or Yellowstone.</p> <p>Dayton Duncan, Burns's longtime colleague, has provided most of the text, which is designed to cast a spell that matches the wonder of the stunning illustrations. The book looks luxurious and feels expensive, but this visit to the National Parks is a great deal.<em>--Joseph J.

As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image � but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

The son of a wealthy stock trader, he lives estranged from his family&#x2014;until he is asked to investigate his father&#x2019;s sudden death. Thus Weaver descends into the deceptive world of the English stock jobbers, gliding between coffee houses and gaming houses, drawing rooms and bordellos. The more Weaver uncovers, the darker the truth becomes, until he realizes that he is following too closely in his father&#x2019;s footsteps&#x2014;and they just might lead him to his own grave. An enthralling historical thriller, <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i> will leave readers wondering just how much has changed in the stock market in the last three hundred years. . . .</p><p>A fool and his money are soon parted--and nowhere so quickly as in the stock market, it would seem. In David Liss's ambitious first novel, <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i>, the year is 1719 and the place London, where human greed, apparently, operated then in much the same manner as it does today. Liss focuses his intricate tale of murder, money, and conspiracy on Benjamin Weaver, ex-boxer, self-described "protector, guardian, bailiff, constable-for-hire, and thief-taker," and son of a Portuguese Jewish "stock-jobber." Weaver's father, from whom he has been estranged, has recently died, the victim of a horse-drawn carriage hit and run. Though his uncle has suggested that the accident wasn't quite so accidental, Benjamin doesn't give the idea much credence: <blockquote> I blush to own I rewarded his efforts to seek my opinion with only a formal reply in which I dismissed his ideas as nonsensical. I did so in part because I did not wish to involve myself with my family and in part because I knew that my uncle, for reasons that eluded me, had loved my father and could not accept the senselessness of so random a death. </blockquote> But then Benjamin is hired by two different men to solve two seemingly unrelated cases. One client, Mr. Balfour, claims his own father's unexpected death "was made to look like self-murder so that a villain or villains could take his money with impunity," and even suggests there might be a link between Balfour senior's death and that of Weaver's father. His next customer is Sir Owen Nettleton, an aristocrat who is keen to recover some highly confidential papers that were stolen from him while he cavorted with a prostitute. Weaver takes on the first case with some reluctance, the second with more enthusiasm. In the end, both converge, leading him back to his family even as they take him deep into the underbelly of London's financial markets. <p> Liss seems right at home in the world he's created, whether describing the company manners of wealthy Jewish merchants at home or the inner workings of Exchange Alley--the 18th-century version of Wall Street. His London is a dank and filthy place, almost lawless but for the scant protection offered by such rogues as Jonathan Wilde, the sinister head of a gang of thieves who profits by selling back to their owners items stolen by his own men. Though better connected socially, the investors involved with the shady South Sea Company have equally larcenous hearts, and Liss does an admirable job of leading the reader through the intricacies of stock trading, bond selling, and insider trading with as little fuss, muss, and confusion as possible. What really makes the book come alive, however, are the details of 18th-century life--from the boxing matches our hero once participated in to the coffee houses, gin joints, and brothels where he trolls for clues. And then there is the matter of Weaver's Jewishness, the prejudices of the society he lives in, and his struggle to come to terms with his own ethnicity. <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i> weaves all these themes together in a manner reminiscent of the long, gossipy novels of Henry Fielding and Laurence Stern. Indeed, Liss manages to suggest the prose style of those authors while keeping his own, less convoluted style. This is one conspiracy guaranteed to succeed. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"In <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i>, David Liss has woven a tale of 18th-century finance, murder, and religion that is a remarkable debut and a thoroughly satisfying novel."<br><p>-Arthur Golden, Author of <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i></p></p><h2>Baddawi</h2><p>An arrestingly drawn debut graphic novel, Baddawi is the story of a young boy named Ahmad struggling to find his place in the world. It explores the childhood of the author&#39;s father from a determinedly boy&#39;s-eye view. Ahmed was raised in the refugee camp of Baddawi in northern Lebanon, one of many thousands of children born to Palestinians who fled (or were expelled from) their homeland during the 1948 war that established the state of Israel. Ahmad&#39;s dogged pursuit of education and opportunity echoes the journey of the Palestinian people, as they make the best of their existing circumstances while remaining determined to one day return to their homeland.</p><p><b>Leila Abdelrazaq</b> is a Chicago-based, Palestinian-American artist and organizer. She was a 2015 graduate of DePaul University where she double majored in Theatre Arts and Arabic Studies. During her time at DePaul, she served in their chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and on the National SJP Steering Committee. When not drawing comics, studying Arabic, or working for justice for Palestinians, Leila enjoys carpentry, painting, breaking things, and making a mess.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Abdelrazaq's father, Ahmad, grew up as a refugee in Lebanon after his family fled Palestine in the 1940s, dividing his time between Baddawi, a refugee camp, and war-torn Beirut. Here, the author depicts Ahmad's childhood and teenage experiences, from the celebration of Ramadan to nighttime raids of the camp. The story builds on this mix of mundane, day-to-day moments and singular, devastating events to create a picture of the life and struggles of a Palestinian refugee. This work is reminiscent of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis (Pantheon, 2003), as it illuminates the experiences of a young person caught up in a country's political conflict, although the vignettes and historical explanations are less refined. Like Persepolis, the events of Ahmad's story are also still very relevant today. Abdelrazaq's black-and-white drawings are evocative, and Ahmad's tale serves as a solid foundation for an exploration of a part of the Palestinian experience in the second half of the 20th century. A glossary provides some context, defining Arab words and explaining key political players and places.

Ruthie said she'd just gotten home from the Piggly Wiggly with a week's worth of groceries when this skinny, bucktoothed varmint jumped out of the bushes and started in with a lot of crazy talk.<br><br> "What exactly did he say, Miss Holder?"<br><br> "He told me that the g.d. Mexican cartel was in my kitchen making chorizo and eggs and if I walked inside they'd have their way with me," she said. "I told him it was a lot of foolish talk, but he insisted on going in without me. Next thing I knew, he was running out with my Browning and headed to the shed."<br><br> Lillie reached down and lowered the volume on the police radio. She was tall, with an athlete's lean muscles and lots of crazy light brown hair she kept neat in a bun and under a ball cap. That day, she wore gold aviator glasses, a Glock 19 on her hip, and chewed gum, as she asked, "Have you ever seen this asshole before?"<br><br> "This man wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes, just a pair of ragged old Levi's," Ruthie Holder said. "He had a tattoo of Hank Williams Junior on his back. Do you think I'd ever consort with trash like that?"<br><br> "No, ma'am," Lillie said. Ruthie ran the Citizens Bank for years, served as president of the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and still offered her harp-playing skills to local weddings and funerals. Lillie didn't think she even knew "All My Rowdy Friends" or "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound."<br><br> "I sure love that gun," Ruthie said. "I won it in a raffle. And since my husband died, it gave me a lot of comfort."<br><br> "Understand that," Lillie said. "I feel the same way about the Winchester I had at Ole Miss. I won a lot of tournaments with her."<br><br> "Her?" Ruthie said. "Didn't know a gun could be a woman."<br><br> Lillie smiled and shrugged. Standing tall, feeling good after running five miles that morning, finishing it off with a hundred push-ups and a hundred sit-ups. If she was going to watch over Tibbehah County in the years to come, better be in shape. "Makes complete sense to me," she said. "What'd this man look like and which way did he head?"<br><br> "He was ugly."<br><br> "Yes, ma'am," Lillie said. "But can you be more specific, Mrs. Holder?"<br><br> "Skinny and rangy. Black hair, but shaved down," she said. "Wore an earring. And had thin little hairs sprouting on his chin. Like some kind of animal. What does all that matter? How many folks do you know riding four-wheelers without shirts and sporting a tattoo of Hank Junior?"<br><br> Lillie grinned at her. "In this county?" she asked. "About every other son of a bitch."<br><br> Lillie told her they'd find him, already knowing they were looking for an authentic piece of crap named David John Norwood. She'd arrested Norwood for aggravated assault and drug possession a few weeks after becoming acting sheriff, back when the newly elected sheriff Rusty Wise got himself killed. Norwood only got probation and was left to raise hell and stir shit across the county as he pleased.<br><br> Lillie climbed into her Jeep Cherokee with its big gold star on the door, grabbed the mic, and called in to Mary Alice at dispatch. "Can you get me D. J. Norwood's parole officer?" she said.<br><br> "Oh, Lord," Mary Alice said. "What's that boy done now?"<br><br> "Same old shit," Lillie said. "Lost his fucking mind. Also get me Jimmy Deets over at Wildlife. I think Norwood's headed way, way off road and into the Big Woods."<br><br> "Which direction?"<br><br> "Headed north," Lillie said. "I say he's going into the National Forest, looking for the Trace."<br><br> "Why?"<br><br> "Probably because he wants to be with the rest of the animals," she said. "Let Deets know he is armed, dangerous, and crazy as hell."<br><br> Lillie Virgil knocked her Cherokee in gear, following the muddy ATV tracks until they hit a dirt road into the hills. The back wheels of the Jeep spun out dirt and gravel before finding solid footing. She lowered the window and listened, chewing gum, rifle in the passenger seat at her side.<br><br> So you were a cheerleader?� Fannie Hathcock asked the young girl sitting in a chair in front of her.<br><br> "Yes, ma'am."<br><br> "Don't 'Yes, ma'am' me or I won't ever give you a job," Fannie said. "Just how old do you think I am?"<br><br> "I don't know," the girl said. She shuffled in her seat and glanced away. "Hate to say."<br><br> "But old," Fannie said. "You think I'm over-the-hill? Too old to show my goodies to fat old truckers?"<br><br> "I didn't mean nothing by it," the girl said. "I just was trying to be respectful, is all. You dress real nice. Smell good. And you own your own place."<br><br> Fannie smoothed down the lace on her white Valentino skirt, black shirt open wide at the throat. She wore a bright ruby in the shape of a heart on a chain around her neck. "You like it better than the old place?"<br><br> "I never saw the old place," the girl said. "My dad used to go there. When he'd go on a drunk with his uncle and them. My mom said it was against God. But she's always saying things like that."<br><br> Fannie, a true and authentic redhead cap to cat, rested her butt-nice and tight, for a woman in her forties-on the edge of her desk. Her office door was open, and from where she looked over the girl's shoulder she could get a good bird's-eye view of the floor of Vienna's. Vienna's Place is what she'd rechristened the renovated space of a true Mississippi shithole called the Booby Trap. Vienna was Fannie's grandmother, the woman who taught her the Golden Rule-Men will do anything for pussy. Vienna sure had made her rich.<br><br> Fannie tapped at a Dunhill box and lifted a small brown cigarillo into her mouth and looked down at the girl. Bleached blonde hair, a dull, freckled face, and one piercing in her nose and one in the tongue. She also had a streak of black in the blonde. Girl said she was eighteen, but Fannie would need to see some ID. That's the last thing she needed-trouble with the law over damn Southern jailbait.<br><br> "You know some tricks?" Fannie said.<br><br> "Excuse me?"<br><br> "I don't mean your twat, baby," she said. "I mean with all the cheerleading. Flips, tumbling. A damn naked handstand."<br><br> "I was a flyer."<br><br> "What the hell's a flyer?"<br><br> "I was on top," the girl said. "Bigger girls would lift me up and toss me into the air."<br><br> "Nobody will toss you around here," Fannie said. "We look out for our girls. Nobody gets hurt. I'm not Johnny Fucking Stagg."<br><br> "I hear the money is real good."<br><br> "It is," Fannie said, spewing smoke from the side of her mouth. "But the house gets forty percent. And you need to tip your bouncer and the DJ every damn night. You need to get straight with that right off."<br><br> The girl's freckled face dropped. She looked down at her stubby little fingers, with black nail polish, probably thinking that she could keep all that trucker cash as long as she showed off those perky young boobies and shook that smooth, shaved tail.<br><br> "OK," the girl said. "When can I start?"<br><br> "When can you show me some ID?"<br><br> The young girl opened up her purse. She had on a short pink T-shirt, cutoff jeans, and cheap brown boots inlaid with cactuses and cowboys. She showed her ID. Looked to be she was telling the truth.<br><br> "Ever get nekkid?" Fannie said.<br><br> "Sure."<br><br> "For money?"<br><br> The girl shrugged.<br><br> "All of it flashing and jiggling on a hot white stage," Fannie said. "With nasty old truckers and gray-headed perverts wanting to lick you like a damn ice cream cone."<br><br> "I can do it."<br><br> "Lap dance is forty bucks," Fannie said. "I never minded the grind. But I sure minded the smell."<br><br> "What if they mess with you?" the girl said, looking Fannie full on in the eye now. "What if they're wanting to touch you and all?"<br><br> "They can touch up top all they want, but never below," Fannie said. "One of them wants to start dialing home with his digits, you just make sure Lyle knows."<br><br> The girl looked confused. "Who's Lyle?"<br><br> "Runs a group of Bad News Bears around here called the Born Losers," she said. "They ride bikes and raise hell out of the motel across the street. The Golden Cherry. When they're not too drunk or stoned, they offer us some protection. That's the other rule-Don't mess with the bikers. They're hired help."<br><br> "Yes, ma'am."<br><br> "God damn it."<br><br> "Sorry."<br><br> Fannie smiled while the smoke scattered from the office and out into the big open space of Vienna's. Ceiling fans broke it apart. She'd taken down old Johnny's place to the studs and built it back up, with a new tin roof, heart pine floors, and a long old bar she'd had shipped piece by piece from Kansas City, Missouri. Fannie "Belle" Hathcock had just upped the class in this north Mississippi town by a hundred and fifty percent.<br><br> "Whatta you say, girl?" Fannie said.<br><br> "Forty percent?"<br><br> "Let me know if you find better job opportunities in Jericho," Fannie said. "I heard they're hiring a fry cook down at the Sonic."<br><br> In his previous life as the go-to Hollywood stuntman, Quinn Colson�s dad, Jason, must�ve landed on his head a few times. Ever since he�d come back to Jericho, he�d been filled with all kinds of crazy ideas, schemes, and various delusions. There was a kids� go-cart track he wanted to open in the parking lot of the old Kentucky Fried Chicken, or bring a Hooters to the people of Tibbehah County-he knew some people in Memphis who�d back him-and, lately, he�d been talking about turning Quinn�s farm into a dude ranch.<br><br> Quinn didn't have time for any of it. He'd been going on little sleep since returning from Afghanistan seven days earlier, where he'd been training a local police force on behalf of the U.S. government. He was in his mid-thirties now, tall and lean, with a sharp-chiseled face, the high cheekbones from some Choctaw blood mixed in the ornery Scotch-Irish. Overseas, he'd let his hair grow out a bit, and now he sported a neat dark beard. He had on an old white tee and a pair of Levi's, as he watched the sun rise across his land, smoking a Liga Privada, with his cattle dog, Hondo, laying at his feet.<br><br> Jason rode up soon after, lashing his quarter horse to Quinn's truck's tailgate. "Hadn't you shaved yet?" Jason said.<br><br> "Barbershop's been closed since Mr. Jim died."<br><br> "Might oughtta keep it," Jason said. "Women sure do love outlaws."<br><br> "That what you were?" Quinn said. "Out in L.A.?"<br><br> Jason grinned. "If that's what they wanted," he said. "Then, sure. Beach bunnies could call me Jesse James. Come on and walk with me, I got something to talk about."<br><br> "We can talk right here on the porch."<br><br> "Be better if we get up, see some things, get the old imaginations working."<br><br> "Hell, Dad," Quinn said. "I know exactly what you're wanting to show me and the answer is no thank you. Can't you just let a man rest a bit? Sit back and fire up a stick with his dog he hasn't seen in a long while?"<br><br> "Plenty of time for Hondo," Jason said. "But opportunity? Opportunity doesn't come around that often. Can't you hear that sound?"<br><br> "That's just the cicadas," he said. "Screwing in the trees. They sure love all this heat."<br><br> Quinn stood up, stretched, and walked back into the old tin-roofed farmhouse that had stood on his family's land since 1895 and grabbed a pair of beaten cowboy boots. He slid them on, broken-in and comfortable, and returned, the screen door thwacking behind him. The house had a natural shotgun cooling effect between front door and back that helped as the summer wound down.<br><br> He reached for his cigar, burning on top of a coffee mug, and followed.<br><br> Jason was in his mid-sixties, wiry and fit, with a weathered face from years of drinking, fighting, and professionally racking up the odometer on his body. He kept a mustache and goatee, now snow-white like his longish hair. His T-shirt read stunts unlimited, an organization he'd helped found in the 1970s with a crazy man from Arkansas named Hal Needham. As Jason walked, Quinn noted the limp in his right leg was growing worse. The ball socket in his dad's hip and some of his femur had been telescoped when a landing platform busted on the set of The Fall Guy.<br><br> It was hard for Quinn to pass judgment on someone who punished his body. Quinn's ten years as a U.S. Army Ranger, most of it as a sergeant in some godforsaken country, had left him with a lot of mileage and scars. The years he'd spent as Tibbehah County sheriff had earned him a couple of gunshot wounds, which the people repaid by voting him out of office a year ago.<br><br> He followed his father through a ragged, twisting trail into some second-growth woods of pine, oak, and cedar, fringes of the land being eaten up by kudzu. It had rained the night before and the air smelled of damp earth and leaves, the canopy above him a bright green, lichen on the big trunks of oaks almost glowing. Water continued to drip on pine needles.<br><br> "I know you've just gotten home," Jason said, "but you need to think on the future. You need to think about what's going to be here after I'm gone and you're gone. Don't you want to leave something for Little Jason? Or if you and Anna Lee start having kids of your own?"<br><br> "Nothing's going to happen to this land," Quinn said. "And I don't think I'm having kids anytime soon."<br><br> "Y'all talking?"<br><br> Quinn didn't answer.<br><br> "I started late," Jason said. "Missed out on a lot of things."<br><br> "You missed out on a lot of things because you lived thousands of miles away."<br><br> "For a damn good reason."<br><br> Quinn just nodded, not sure if his dad had seen him or not, the older man intent on getting up the trail with that bad leg, cresting the hill over to the land that he wanted to discuss with Quinn. When the trail ended, so did the trees. And most living things. That rotten son of a bitch Johnny Stagg had strip-cleared one hundred acres of property that had once belonged to Quinn's uncle. When Uncle Hamp had fallen behind on some gambling debt, Stagg had swooped in, taken over the land, cut down every single tree, and bulldozed what was left. Johnny Stagg was like that. Conservation and the environment were four-letter words to his kind. And the reason every morning was a little brighter now with Stagg in federal prison.</p><h2>You Gotta Have Wa</h2><p>A hilarious, informative, and riveting account of Japanese baseball and the cultural clashes that ensued when Americans began playing there professionally.<br><br>In Japan, baseball is a way of life.

Once at the heart of astronomy and ocean-going navigation for two millennia, the discipline was also a mainstay of mathematics education for centuries and taught widely until the 1950s. Glen Van Brummelen explores this exquisite branch of mathematics and its role in ancient astronomy, geography, and cartography; Islamic religious rituals; celestial navigation; polyhedra; stereographic projection; and more. He conveys the sheer beauty of spherical trigonometry, providing readers with a new appreciation of its elegant proofs and often surprising conclusions. <i>Heavenly Mathematics</i> is illustrated throughout with stunning historical images and informative drawings and diagrams. This unique compendium also features easy-to-use appendixes as well as exercises that originally appeared in textbooks from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Heavenly Mathematics</i>is heavenly, is mathematics, and is so much more: history, astronomy, geography, and navigation, replete with historical illustrations, elegant diagrams, and charming anecdotes.

Recent clinical and neurobiological research sheds some light into the dark corners of a mind undergoing persistent dissociation, but its integration into the practice of talking therapy has never, until now, been fully realized.<br><br><em>Intensive Psychotherapy for Persistent Dissociative Processes</em> brings readers into the consultation room, and into the minds of both patient and therapist, like no other work on the treatment of trauma and dissociation. Richard A. Chefetz marries neuroscientific sophistication with a wealth of extended case histories, following patients over several years and offering several verbatim session transcripts. His unpacking of the emotionally impactful experience of psychodynamic talking therapy is masterfully written, clearly accessible, and singularly thorough.<br><br> From neurobiological foundations he builds a working understanding of dissociation and its clinical manifestations. Drawing on theories of self-states and their involvement in dissociative experiences, he demonstrates how to identify persistent dissociation and its related psychodynamic processes, including repetition compulsion and enactment. He then guides readers through the beginning stages of a treatment, with particular attention to the psychodynamics of emotion in both patient and therapist.<br><br> The second half of the book immerses readers in emotionally challenging clinical processes, offering insight into the neurobiology of fear and depersonalization, as well as case examples detailing struggles with histories of incest, sexual addiction, severe negativity, negative therapeutic reactions, enactment, and object-coercive doubting. The narrative style of Chefetz&#x2019;s casework is nearly novelistic, bringing to life the clinical setting and the struggles in both patient and therapist. The only mystery in this clinical exposition, as it explores several cases over a number of years, is what will happen next.<br><br> In the depth of his examples and in continual, self-reflexive analysis of flaws in past treatments, Chefetz is both a generous guide and an expert storyteller. <em>Intensive Psychotherapy for Persistent Dissociative Processes</em> is unique in its ability to place readers in the consultation room of psychodynamic therapy. With an evidence-focused approach based in neurobiology and a bold clinical scope, it will be indispensible to new and experienced therapists alike as they grapple with the most intractable clinical obstacles.<br></p><p>Richard A.

Dissociative disorders are frequently described as &#x2018;hidden disorders,&#x2019; in part because even in plain sight their signs and symptoms are subtle and nuanced. That elusiveness is perhaps the most daunting challenge to developing clinicians . . . . I know of no other work on dissociation that contributes so much in this regard. . . .

Despite its title and emphasis on treating dissociative disorders, this book should also be read as a significant contribution to the general understanding of psychopathology and psychological defense.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Journal of Trauma and Dissociation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Chefetz shows by example that we can reach beyond the limits of these disabling disorders. . . . It is clear from case illustrations that Chefetz has a special talent for working with complex conditions, as well guiding less experienced clinicians. Reading this book, I felt the comfort of talking with a mentor about my own difficult or confusing cases. . . . Few resources on this topic rival this well-written book.

This book demonstrates why dissociation is mostly not about dissociate disorders. It is about how a mind struggles to cope with the intolerable and unbearable. As both a traumatologist and a psychodynamic clinician, Chefetz has built a bridge that explores the joint dissociative processes that take place as part of the patient/therapist relationship.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Philip M. Bromberg, PhD, author, <i>The Shadow of the Tsunami: and the Growth of the Relational Mind</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A master teacher on dissociative phenomena, Richard Chefetz integrates scientific sophistication with in-the-trenches clinical mastery. His eloquent writing&#x2015;synthesizing theory and practice, mind and body, left- and right-brain processes, research and application, science and art&#x2015;exemplifies the healing integration sought by every therapist familiar with dissociative disorders.

But in this spirited <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, famed critic Terry Eagleton takes a serious if often amusing look at the question and offers his own surprising answer.<br><br>Eagleton first examines how centuries of thinkers and writers--from Marx and Schopenhauer to Shakespeare, Sartre, and Beckett--have responded to the ultimate question of meaning. He suggests, however, that it is only in modern times that the question has become problematic. But instead of tackling it head-on, many of us cope with the feelings of meaninglessness in our lives by filling them with everything from football to sex, Kabbala, Scientology, "New Age softheadedness," or fundamentalism. On the other hand, Eagleton notes, many educated people believe that life is an evolutionary accident that has no intrinsic meaning. If our lives have meaning, it is something with which we manage to invest them, not something with which they come ready made. Eagleton probes this view of meaning as a kind of private enterprise, and concludes that it fails to holds up. He argues instead that the meaning of life is not a solution to a problem, but a matter of living in a certain way. It is not metaphysical but ethical. It is not something separate from life, but what makes it worth living--that is, a certain quality, depth, abundance and intensity of life. <br><br>Here then is a brilliant discussion of the problem of meaning by a leading thinker, who writes with a light and often irreverent touch, but with a very serious end in mind.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terry Eagleton</strong> is Professor of Cultural Theory and John Rylands Fellow at the University of Manchester. His literary criticism includes <em>Literary Theory: An Introduction, Heathcliff and the Great Hunger</em>, and <em>After Theory</em>. He has also written a novel, <em>Saints and Scholars</em>, several plays and a memoir, <em>The Gatekeeper</em>. He divides his time between Manchester, Dublin and Derry.<br><br>"This is a brief, ambitious, and satisfying book. As a survivor of the theory wars, Terry Eagleton has emerged as a critic and thinker who will help us theologues ponder not only life's meaning but the next steps we should take as even postmodernism fades into cultural history. If there is a cultural life for us all in the aftermath of the conflict between essentialism and relativism, Eagleton's provocative essay will point the way both to making and discovering its meaning."--Gary R. Hall, <em>Anglican Theological Review</em><p></p><br>"Eagleton's witty eclecticism is perfect for such a lofty subject, but would it be inappropriate to ask for more?--Leoppold Froelich, <em>Playboy</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Meaning of Life</em> may be 'lie' relative to how much more a scholar like Mr. Eagleton might have said, but it is still a work that demands close attention from readers who are already well grounded in literature and philosophy."--Mark Grannis, <em>The Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"The news that Terry Eagleton has tackled the meaning of life in a book of a mere 185 pages shouldn't raise any eyebrows. If anyone can pull it off, it's probably him. Eagleton, unsurprisingly, has written an elegant, literate, cogent consideration of a maddeningly slippery topic, one whose conclusions run contrary to conventional wisdom, especially in this country."--Laura Miller, <em>Salon.com</em><p></p><br>"Eagleton's is unlike most works on life's meaning, in which writers often invoke theology. Eagleton's notion of love may seem to lead back to theism, but he shows us we can have meaningful lives whatever our theology, and he invites us all to choose. He deserves a place in most collections."--Leslie Armour, <em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Regardless of whether you agree with him, you'll find yourself challenged by this little book."--<em>Houston Chronicle</em>"<p></p><br></p><h2>Land of the Pilgrims Pride (2) (Ellis the Elephant)</h2><p>In the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Sweet Land of Liberty</i>, Ellis the Elephant sets off on a quest to find out how America became a free and exceptional nation.

Yet it has been all but forgotten. Will Bagley&#x2019;s <i>Blood of the Prophets</i> is an award-winning, riveting account of the attack on the Baker-Fancher wagon train by Mormons in the local militia and a few Paiute Indians. Based on extensive investigation of the events surrounding the murder of over 120 men, women, and children, and drawing from a wealth of primary sources, Bagley explains how the murders occurred, reveals the involvement of territorial governor Brigham Young, and explores the subsequent suppression and distortion of events related to the massacre by the Mormon Church and others.</p><p><b>Will Bagley</b> is an independent historian who has written about overland emigration, frontier violence, railroads, mining, and the Mormons. Bagley has published extensively over the years and is the author and editor of many books, articles, and reviews in professional journals. Bagley is the series editor of Arthur H. Clark Company's documentary history series, <i>KINGDOM IN THE WEST: The Mormons and the American Frontier</i>. Bagley has been a Wallace Stegner Centennial Fellow at the University of Utah and the Archibald Hanna, Jr. Fellow in American History at Yale University's Beinecke Library. <i>Blood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows</i> has won numerous awards including a Spur Award from Western Writers of America, the Bancroft History Prize from the Denver Public Library, Westerners International Best Book, and the Western History Association Caughey Book Prize for the most distinguished book on the history of the American West. <i>So Rugged and Mountainous: Blazing the Trails to Oregon and California, 1812-1848 </i>is the first of four volumes of <i>Overland West: The Story of the Oregon and California Trails Series. </i>In 1857, over 100 men, women, and children in a wagon train from Arkansas were murdered in southern Utah by local settlers aided by Southern Paiute warriors. For 50 years, Mormon historian Juanita Brooks's The Mountain Meadows Massacre has been the standard work on the subject. Here, independent historian and Salt Lake Tribune columnist Bagley claims only to extend Brooks's work. But by using documents not available to Brooks and by following her example in pursuing the truth wherever it led him while not going beyond the available evidence, he confirms her private opinion that territorial Mormon leader and governor Brigham Young was heavily involved in both the massacre and its cover-up. In the process, Bagley has produced the new standard work on the massacre. This well-written and well-thought-out analysis is essential for all libraries with collections on the West or the Mormons.<br><i>Stephen H. Peters, Northern Michigan Univ.

Then there are more than a dozen different Egyptian symbols and pictures for budding artists to replicate. Masiello uses the method made popular by Lee J. Ames's "Draw 50..." series (Doubleday), starting with a basic shape and showing how details can be added one step at a time. He also includes extra suggestions for ambitious artists. Each finished picture is printed in full color and accompanied by a short paragraph that tells an interesting fact about the subject matter. Some of the drawings are quite complicated but they are broken down into manageable sections. For example, one spread shows how to draw the body of Isis, while the next shows how to draw the head. The complexity of some of the drawings may be intimidating to less-confident students, but most are doable for the target audience. Ting Morris's <i>Arts and Crafts of Ancient Egypt</i> (Smart Apple Media, 2006) has a variety of craft ideas and more background information than this offering, but it does not focus on drawing.

All disappears<br>as time and the darkness steal color and rhyme.<br>&#x2013; Dominic to Solange</p><p></p><p>Carpathian males without a lifemate didn't dream. They didn't see in color and they certainly didn't feel emotion. Pain, yes, but not emotion. So why had he been reaching for a dream for the past few years? He was an ancient, an experienced warrior. He had no time for fantasy, or for imagination. His world was stark and barren, a necessity for battling an enemy who, inevitably, had been a friend or family member.</p><p>Over the first hundred or so years after losing his emotions, he had held out hope. As centuries passed, the hope of finding his lifemate had faded. He had accepted he would find her in the next life and he was carrying out his resolve to do his last duty to his people. Yet here he was, an ancient of great experience, Dominic of the Dragonseeker line, a lineage as old as time itself, a man of wisdom, a warrior renowned and feared&#x2014;lying awake beneath the rich soil, dreaming.</p><p>Dreams should have felt insubstantial&#x2014;and at first his had been. A woman. Just a vague idea of her appearance. So young in comparison to him, but a warrior in her own right. She hadn't been his concept of the woman who would partner him, yet as she grew in substance over the years, he realized how perfect she was for him. He had fought far too long to ever lay down his sword. He knew no other way of life. Duty and sacrifice were bred into his very bones and he needed a woman who could understand him.</p><p>Perhaps that was what dreams were. He'd never dreamt until a few years ago. Never. Dreams were emotions, and he'd long ago lost those. Dreams were color, although not his. But they felt like color as the years shaped the woman. She was a mystery, sheer confidence when she fought. She often had fresh bruises and wounds that left scars on her soft skin. He'd taken to examining her carefully each time they met&#x2014;healing her had become a traditional greeting. He found himself smiling inside, thinking how she was entirely the opposite of confident when it came to viewing herself as a woman.</p><p>For a few moments he contemplated why he should be smiling inside. Smiling was equated with happiness, and he had no emotions to feel such things, but his memories of emotions were sharpening as he moved toward the end of his life, instead of dimming as he had expected. Because when he summoned the dream, he felt a sense of comfort, of well-being and happiness.</p><p>Over the years she had become clearer to him. A jaguar-woman. A fierce warrior with exactly the same values he held on loyalty and family and duty. He would never forget the night, only a week ago, when he saw her eyes in color. For a moment he couldn't breathe, looking at her in wonder, shocked that he could remember colors so vividly that he could attribute an actual color to her cat's eyes.</p><p>Her eyes were beautiful, glowing green with faint hints of gold and amber that darkened when he managed to elicit a laugh from her. She didn't laugh often or easily, and when she did, he felt it was more of a victory than any of the battles he'd won.</p><p>As dreams went&#x2014;and they only occurred when he was awake&#x2014;they always seemed a bit out of focus. But he looked forward to seeing her. He felt protective toward her, as if his allegiance had already swung toward his dream woman. He wrote to her, songs of love, saying all the things he wished to tell his lifemate. And when she refused to rest, he'd lay her down, her head in his lap, stroking her thick mane of hair and singing to her in his language. He'd never felt more content&#x2014;or more complete.</p><p>He stirred, disturbing the rich soil surrounding him. The moment he moved, the pain took him, thousands of knives ripping from the inside out. The tainted vampire blood he'd deliberately swallowed had been thick with parasites, and they moved in him, replicating, seeking to take over his body, to invade every cell, every organ. And as often as he purged some to keep the numbers down, they seemed to work harder to multiply.</p><p>Dominic hissed out his breath between his teeth as he forced his rising. It was not yet fully night and he was an ancient Carpathian with many battles and kills to his name. As a rule ancients didn't rise before the sun had set, but he needed the extra time to scout his enemy and get his bearings in this land of walking myths and legends.</p><p>Deep within the cave he'd chosen in the Amazon forest, he moved the earth gently, allowing it to settle around him as he awakened, wanting to keep the area as undisturbed as possible. He traveled only at night, as his kind did, listening to the whisper of evil, on the trail of a master vampire, one he was certain had knowledge of the plans to destroy the Carpathian species once and for all. His people knew that the vampires were coming together under the rule of the five. At first the groups had been small and scattered, the attacks easily fended off , but lately the whisper of conspiracy had grown into a roar, and the groups were larger and more organized and widespread than first thought. He was certain the parasites in the tainted blood were the key to identifying all those forging an allegiance to the five <i>masters</i>.</p><p>He'd gleaned that much over his days of traveling. He had tested the theory several times, coming across three vampires. Two were relatively new, and neither had the parasites and were easy for an experienced hunter to kill. But the third had satisfied his questions. The moment he came into close proximity, the parasites had gone into a frenzy of recognition. He had listened to the vampire bragging for most of the night, telling him of their growing legions and how emissaries were meeting in the Amazon, where they had allies in the jaguar-men and a human society that had no idea they were in bed with the very ones they sought to destroy. The <i>masters</i> were using both humans and jaguar-men to hunt and kill Carpathians. Dominic had killed the vampire, a quick extraction of the heart, and, calling down the lightning, incinerated him. Before leaving the area, he had taken great care to remove any trace of his presence.</p><p>He knew time was running out fast. The parasites were hard at work, whispering to him, murmuring evil enticements, unrelenting in their quest for him to join with the <i>masters</i>. He was an ancient without a lifemate and the darkness was strong in him already. His beloved sister had disappeared hundreds of years earlier&#x2014;he now knew she was dead and her children safe with the Carpathian people. He could do this one last task and end his barren existence with honor.</p><p>He rose from the rich soil, as rejuvenated as one with parasites in his blood could possibly be. The cave deep beneath the earth kept the sun from touching his skin, but he felt it anyway, knowing it was just outside the darkness, waiting to scorch him. His skin prickled and burned in anticipation. He strode through the cave with absolute confidence. He moved with the easy self-assurance of a warrior, flowing over the uneven ground in the darkness.</p><p>As he began the climb to the surface, he thought of her&#x2014;his lifemate, the woman in his dreams. She wasn't his true lifemate of course, because if she were he would be seeing colors vividly, not just her eyes. He would see the various shades of green in the rain forest, but everything around him remained gray hued. Was finding solace with her cheating? Was singing to her about his love of his lifemate cheating? He longed for her, needing to conjure her up at times to get through the night when his blood was on fire and he was being eaten alive from the inside out. He thought of her soft skin, a sensation that seemed amazing when he was like an oak tree, hard iron, his skin as tough as leather.</p><p>As he neared the exit of the cave, he could see light spilling into the tunnel and his body cringed, an automatic reaction after centuries of living in the night. He loved the night, no matter where he was or what continent he was on. The moon was a friend, the stars often guiding lights he navigated by. He was in unfamiliar territory, but he knew the De La Cruz brothers patrolled the rain forest, although there were five of them to cover a very large territory and they were spread thin. He had a feeling the five who were recruiting the lesser vampires against the Carpathians had deliberately chosen the De La Cruz territory as their headquarters.</p><p>The Malinov brothers and the De La Cruz brothers had grown up together, more than friends, claiming a kinship. They'd been regarded by the Carpathian people as two of the most powerful families, warriors unsurpassed by many. Dominic thought about their personalities, and the camaraderie that had turned into a rivalry. It made sense that the Malinov brothers would choose to set their headquarters right under the noses of the very ones who had plotted theoretical ways to remove the Dubrinsky line as rulers of the Carpathian people and then, in the end, had sworn their allegiance to the prince. The Malinov brothers would become the De La Cruz brothers' most bitter and unrelenting enemies.</p><p>Dominic's logical line of reasoning had been confirmed by the vampire he had killed in the Carpathian Mountains, a very talkative lesser vampire who wanted to brag about all he knew. Dominic had made his way, taking no prisoners, so to speak, surprised at how the parasites were such a fantastic warning system. It had never occurred to the Malinov brothers that any Carpathian would dare to ingest the blood and invade their very camp.</p><p>Going closer to the cave entrance, he was hit by the noise first, the sounds of birds and monkeys and the incessant hum of insects in spite of the steady rain. It was hot, and steam actually rose from the floor just outside the cave as the moisture poured down from the skies. Trees hung over the swollen banks of the river, their root systems great gnarled cages, the thick tendrils snaking over the ground to create waves of wooden fins.</p><p>Dominic was impervious to rain or heat; he could regulate his own temperature to stay comfortable. But those thirty feet or so from the entrance of his cave to the relative safety under the thick canopy were going to be hell, and he wasn't looking forward to it. Traveling in the sun, even in another form, was painful, and with the sensation of glass shards ripping his insides to shreds, he had enough to contend with.</p><p>It was difficult not to reach for the dream. In her company, the pain eased and the whispering in his head ceased. The constant murmurs, the parasites working on his acceptance of the <i>masters</i> and their plan, were wearying. The dream gave him solace in spite of knowing his lifemate wasn't real.</p><p>He knew he had slowly built up his lifemate in his mind&#x2014;not her looks, but her characteristics, the traits that were important to him. He needed a woman who was loyal beyond all else, a woman who would guard their children fiercely, who would stand with him no matter what came at them, one he would know was at his side, and he wouldn't have to worry that she couldn't protect herself or their children.</p><p>He needed a woman who, when it was just the two of them, would follow his lead, who would be feminine and fragile and all the things she couldn't be during the times they would have to fight. And he wanted that side of her completely to himself. It was selfish, maybe, but he had never had anything for himself, and his woman was for him alone. He didn't want other men to see her the way he did. He didn't want her to look at other men. She was for him alone, and maybe that was what a dream really was&#x2014;building the perfect woman in your mind when you knew you'd never have one.</p><p>He was well aware of her fighting skills. He saw the battle scars. He respected and admired her when he walked with her, yet he couldn't really hold her image for long. In dreams she came to him, shielded by a heavy veil, their exchanges in images more than words. It had taken a long time for either to reveal any part of themselves other than the warrior. They'd built trust between them slowly&#x2014;and he liked that about her. She didn't give her allegiance easily, but when she did, she gave it wholly. And it was to him.</p><p>Again he found himself smiling inside at such a ridiculous fantasy at his age. It must be a sign of his mind deteriorating. Senility had set in. But how he missed her when he couldn't bring her to him. She seemed closer there in the heat of the forest, with the rain coming down in silvery sheets. The veil of moisture reminded him of the first time he'd managed to peer through that haze in his dream and see her face so clearly. She'd stolen his breath. She'd looked so frightened, as if she'd deliberately revealed herself&#x2014;finally taken a chance, but stood trembling, waiting for him to pass judgment on her.</p><p>At that moment he'd felt closer to actual love than he ever had before. He tried to compare the feeling with what he'd felt for his sister, Rhiannon, in the early days when they'd all been happy and he still had his emotions. He'd held on to the memory of love all those centuries, yet now, when he needed the feeling to complete his dream, before he went out fighting, the feeling was entirely different.</p><p><i>Feeling</i>. He turned the word over and over in his mind. What did it mean? Memories? Or reality? And why would his memories be so sharp all of a sudden, here in the forest? He smelled the rain, inhaled the scent of it, and there was an edge of pleasure in the sensation. It was frustrating, to almost catch the feeling, and yet it eluded him. It wasn't simply a byproduct of ingesting the vampire blood&#x2014;he'd begun "dreaming" much earlier. And the dreams took place while he was awake.</p><p>He was suspicious of all things that didn't make sense. He wasn't a man prone to dreams or fantasies, and this mythical woman was becoming too much a part of his life&#x2014;of him. She was tricking him into thinking she was a true lifemate&#x2014;a reality instead of a myth&#x2014;yet here in the land where myths and legends came to life, he could almost convince himself she was real. But even if she was, it was far too late. The continual pain clawing at his belly told him his time had run its course and he had to carry out his plan to infiltrate the enemy camp, gain their plans, send the information to Zacarias De La Cruz and then kill as many vampires as he could before he went down. He chose to go out fighting for his people.</p><p>He shifted, taking the form of the lord of the skies&#x2014;the harpy eagle. The bird was larger than normal, and the harpies were already large birds. His wingspan was a good seven feet, his talons enormous. The form would help to protect him as he went into the sunlight before reaching the relative shelter of the canopy. He hopped on the ground and into the light. In spite of the heavy rain, the light burst over him. Smoke rose from the dark feathers, pouring off the bird's form. He'd suffered burns and his body remained ravaged with the scars, although they'd eased over time, but he would never forget that pain. It was branded into his very bones.</p><p>Sharply sucking in his breath, he forced himself to spread his wings and rise toward that hideous...</p></p><h2>Mauser Rifles &amp; Carbines Handbook</h2><p>Ideal workshop reference for stripping &amp; assembly with exploded parts drawings, specifications, service accessories, historical information and recommended reading references.

I sat down to write <em>61 Hours</em> with six things on my mind. First was the title...it just popped into my head and stayed there (and I knew I wanted the 61 to be written in figures, not words, so if you&#x2019;re the kind of reader who arranges your shelves alphabetically--I apologize!)</p> <p>Second, I knew it would once again feature Jack Reacher...over the last 13 books he&#x2019;s built up such enthusiasm and loyalty among readers I knew I&#x2019;d be crazy not to keep on reporting his adventures.</p> <p>Thirdly, I knew I wanted very, very cold weather. My fifth book, <em>Echo Burning</em>, was set in the west of Texas in a heat wave, and the extreme temperature was seen as a real character in the story, so I wanted to try the same thing again, but this time at the opposite end of the thermometer. I was a little nervous at first, because one of my early writer heroes was Alistair MacLean, who wrote cold weather so well. But most of his cold stories were set up on the polar ice cap, or above the Arctic Circle, and I knew Reacher would have no reason to go there. In the end I chose South Dakota in the depths of winter as a location, and I&#x2019;ll know I&#x2019;ve succeeded if you shiver over every page.</p> <p>Fourth, fifth, and sixth, I had three names to work with--winners of your-name-as-a-character charity auction lots. A gentleman named Mark Salter helped out with autism research and asked for his mother&#x2019;s name to be in the book--Mrs. Janet Salter; and then for two separate literacy projects, a man named Andrew Peterson won an auction, and the man who won the other wanted his wife&#x2019;s name included--Susan Turner. All three winners made very generous donations to the various charities, so I decided it was only fair to make all three into important, central characters.</p> <p>The only problem was...Mr. Turner asked that the character named after his wife have a romantic entanglement with Reacher.

Focusing on the richness of artwork created in the US and Canada, <em>Native</em> <em>North American Art</em>, Second Edition, discusses 3,000 years of architecture, wood and rock carvings, basketry, dance masks, clothing and more. The expanded text discusses twentieth- and twenty-first-century arts in all media including works by James Luna, Kent Monkman, Nadia Myre, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Will Wilson, and many more. Authors Berlo and Phillips incorporate new research and scholarship, examining such issues as art and ethics, gender, representation, and the colonial encounter. By bringing into one conversation the seemingly separate realms of the sacred and the secular, the political and the domestic, and the ceremonial and the commercial, <em>Native North American Art</em> shows how visual arts not only maintain the integrity of spiritual and social systems within Native North American societies, but have long been part of a cross-cultural experience as well.<br></p><p><br><strong>Janet Catherine Berlo</strong> is Professor of Visual and Cultural Studies at the University of Rochester.

It is she who tells this warm, engaging story of how hundreds of gallons of sap are turned into the precious maple syrup. Grandpa continues to use the old bucket-drop method of gathering sap, not the modern vacuum-tube system. The girl also tells about the important traditions that surround this event: everyone pitching in to help, enjoying Grandma's chicken and dumplings in the sugarhouse, and playing games until the syrup is ready. The descriptive language draws readers into the scene effectively. One can almost feel the "maple steam" that fills the sugarhouse and experience the "cotton-candy sweet" smell in the air. The somewhat idealized, detailed, bright, double-page oil paintings are equally effective. This book is great as a read-aloud for introducing children anywhere to maple sugaring, or for young readers to enjoy on their own. There is a lot of similarity between this book and Jessie Haas's Sugaring (Greenwillow, 1996) and Margaret Carney's At Grandpa's Sugar Bush (Kids Can, 1998).

At the age of ten, Icy, a bright, curious child orphaned as a baby but raised by adoring grandparents, begins to have strange experiences. Try as she might, her "secrets"&#x2014;verbal croaks, groans, and physical spasms&#x2014;keep afflicting her. As an adult, she will find out she has Tourette&#x2019;s Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but for years her behavior is the source of mystery, confusion, and deep humiliation.</p><p>Narrated by a grown up Icy, the book chronicles a difficult, but ultimately hilarious and heartwarming journey, from her first spasms to her self-acceptance as a young woman. Curious about life beyond the hills, talented, and energetic, Icy learns to cut through all barriers&#x2014;physical, mental, and spiritual&#x2014;in order to find community and acceptance.</p><p>Along her journey, Icy faces the jeers of her classmates as well as the malevolence of her often-ignorant teachers&#x2014;including Mrs. Stilton, one of the most evil fourth grade teachers ever created by a writer. Called willful by her teachers and "Frog Child" by her schoolmates, she is exiled from the schoolroom and sent to a children&#x2019;s asylum where it is hoped that the roots of her mysterious behavior can be discovered. Here Icy learns about difference&#x2014;her own and those who are even more scarred than she. Yet, it isn&#x2019;t until Icy returns home that she really begins to flower, especially through her friendship with the eccentric and obese Miss Emily, who knows first-hand how it feels to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Under Miss Emily&#x2019;s tutelage, Icy learns about life&#x2019;s struggles and rewards, survives her first comical and heartbreaking misadventure with romance, discovers the healing power of her voice when she sings, and ultimately&#x2014;takes her first steps back into the world.</p><p>Gwyn Hyman Rubio&#x2019;s Icy Sparks is a fresh, original, and completely redeeming novel about learning to overcome others&#x2019; ignorance and celebrate the differences that make each of us unique.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>The eponymous heroine of Gwyn Rubio's <i>Icy Sparks</i> is only 10 years old the first time it happens. The sudden itching, the pressure squeezing her skull, and the "little invisible rubber bands" attached to her eyelids are all symptoms of Tourette's syndrome. At this point, of course, Icy doesn't yet have a name for these unsettling impulses. But whenever they become too much to resist, she runs down to her grandparents' root cellar, and there she gives in, croaking, jerking, cursing, and popping her eyes. Nicknamed the "frog child" by her classmates, Icy soon becomes "a little girl who had to keep all of her compulsions inside." Only a brief confinement at the Bluegrass State Hospital persuades her that there are actually children more "different" than she. <p> As a first novel about growing up poor, orphaned, and prone to fits in a small Appalachian town, <i>Icy Sparks</i> tells a fascinating story. By the time the epilogue rolls around, Icy has prevailed over her disorder and become a therapist: "Children silent as stone sing for me. Children who cannot speak create music for me." For readers familiar with this particular brand of coming-of-age novel--affliction fiction?--Icy's triumph should come as no great surprise. That's one problem. Another is Rubio's tendency to lapse into overheated prose: this is a novel in which the characters would sooner yell, pout, whine, moan, or sass a sentence than simply say it. But the real drawback to <i>Icy Sparks</i> is that some of the characters--especially the bad ones--are drawn with very broad strokes indeed, and the moral principles tend to be equally elementary: embrace your difference, none of us is alone, and so on. When Icy gets saved at a tent revival, even Jesus takes on the accents of a self-help guru: "You must love yourself!" With insights like these, this is one Southern novel that's more Wally Lamb than Harper Lee. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Gwyn Hyman Rubio has been nominated for a Pushcart Press Editors&#x2019; Book Award and anthologized in <b>Above Ground: Stories About Life and Death by New Southern Writers</b>.

But something's missing--perhaps it's the mostly subtle British accents and light characterizations. Grimes plays her characters to the hilt, yet Hecht seems to hold back, so the vocal portraits seem a little lackluster. The abridgment is good for the most part, but the ending seems to dissipate after a strong and intriguing build-up.

Useful for a complete beginner or those further along the path.</p><p>Dr Stephen Skinner authored "Techniques of High Magic" with Francis King in 1976, but it is still remarkably relevant today. He has produced a number of other books on practical magic since including: "Geomancy in Theory and Practice", which is still the most complete work in English on the history and practice of Western divinatory geomancy. Highly illustrated coffee-table books on "Millennium Prophecies: Apocalypse 2000" and "Nostradamus" (also with Francis King) were followed by "Sacred Geometry." From 2004 - 2010 he collaborated with David Rankine to produce the first six volumes of the Sourceworks of Ceremonial Magic series including fresh translations of a number of grimoires: "The Key of Solomon", the "Lemegeton", "Goetia", "Ars Almadel", "Theurgia-Goetia," Ars Paulina", "Janua Reserata", and "Sefer Raziel".He produced a substantial reference book: the "Complete Magician&#x2019;s Tables" which is a tabular summary of the correspondences that are important to the theory and practice of magic; their Kabbalistic framework; the attendant angels and demons from many grimoires; the gods of many cultures; the constituents of astrology (Greek, Babylonian and Egyptian); gem stones, plants, perfumes and incenses of practical magic; the gematria and isopsephy of many Greek and Hebrew words, and correspondences with Eastern belief systems like the Yi Jing, a total of over 840 comparative tables. Stephen summarized the practical magic techniques to be found in the grimoires in his "Techniques of Solomonic Magic" in 2015, and went back to the main roots of all western magic, the Greek magical papyri published in "Techniques of Graeco-Egyptian Magic" in 2014. He has also written a number of books on Feng Shui,including a substantial reference book to the subject: the "Guide to the Feng Shui Compass," the fruit of years of research into Chinese sources in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Stephen has written more than 46 books, translated into more than twenty different languages. He was awarded a PhD in Classics by the University of Newcastle for his research on the Greek text of the PGM and a number of Latin grimoires. Stephen lives in Singapore.

Now she again mines her rich Persian heritage in <i>Laughing Without an Accent,</i> sharing stories both tender and humorous on being a citizen of the world, on her well-meaning family, and on amusing cultural conundrums, all told with insights into the universality of the human condition. (Hint: It may have to do with brushing and flossing daily.)<br><br> With dry wit and a bold spirit, Dumas puts her own unique mark on the themes of family, community, and tradition. She braves the uncommon palate of her French-born husband and learns the nuances of having her book translated for Persian audiences (the censors edit out all references to ham). And along the way, she reconciles her beloved Iranian customs with her Western ideals.<br><br> Explaining crossover cultural food fare, Dumas says, &#x201c;The weirdest American culinary marriage is yams with melted marshmallows. I don&#x2019;t know who thought of this Thanksgiving tradition, but I&#x2019;m guessing a hyperactive, toothless three-year-old.&#x201d; On Iranian wedding anniversaries: &#x201c;It just initially seemed odd to celebrate the day that &#x2018;our families decided we should marry even though I had never met you, and frankly, it&#x2019;s not working out so well.&#x2019;&#x201d; On trying to fit in with her American peers: &#x201c;At the time, my father drove a Buick LeSabre, a fancy French word meaning &#x2018;OPEC thanks you.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> Dumas also documents her first year as a new mother, the familial chaos that ensues after she removes the television set from the house, the experience of taking fifty-one family members on a birthday cruise to Alaska, and a road trip to Iowa with an American once held hostage in Iran.<br><br> Droll, moving, and relevant, <i>Laughing Without an Accent</i> shows how our differences can unite us&#x2014;and provides indelible proof that Firoozeh Dumas is a humorist of the highest order.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Laughing Without an Accent</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Dumas is one of those rare people: a naturally gifted storyteller.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Alexander McCall Smith</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Laughing Without an Accent</i> is written . . . as if Dumas were sharing a cup of coffee with her reader as she relates her comic tales. . . . Firoozeh Dumas exudes undeniable charm [as she] reveals a zeal for culture&#x2014;both new and old&#x2014;and the enduring bonds of a family filled with outsize personalities.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;[Dumas is] like a blend of Anne Lamott and Erma Bombeck.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Bust</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Humorous without being sentimental, [Dumas] speaks to the American experience.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Plain Dealer</i></b></p><p><b>Firoozeh Dumas</b> was born in Abadan, Iran, and moved to California at the age of seven. After a two-year stay, she and her family moved back to Iran and resided in Ahvaz and Tehran. Two years later, Dumas returned to California, where she later attended the University of California at Berkeley.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Funny in Farsi</i> was a finalist for both the PEN/USA Award in 2004 and the Thurber Prize for American Humor, and has been adopted in junior high, high school and college curricula throughout the nation. It has been selected for common reading programs at several universities including: California State Bakersfield, California State University at Sacramento, Fairmont State University in West Virginia, Gallaudet University, Salisbury University, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;La Crosse and the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dumas is also the author of <i>Laughing Without an Accent, </i>a collection of autobiographical essays published in May 2008. She currently lives with her husband and their three children in Northern California.Funny in Persian <br><br>Iran does not currently adhere to international copyright laws. This comes as a shock to most people, given Iran&#x2019;s law-abiding image.<br><br>Not adhering to international copyright laws means that any book, regardless of origin, can be translated into Persian and sold in Iran. No matter how poorly a book might be translated, the author has no control. No artist wants his name on a work that does not represent him fairly, but in Iran, tell it to the judge, and he doesn&#x2019;t care. When Abbas Milani, a very well respected author and professor, found a Persian translation of his history book, he found it to be completely different from the original. He contacted the publisher in Iran, who told him, &#x201c;Our translation is better than your book.&#x201d;<br><br>Every time a Harry Potter installment is released, there is a mad rush around the world to translate the book. One Iranian publisher divides each book into about twenty sections, giving each section to a different translator. That way, his version, which must resemble a patchwork quilt more than anything J. K. Rowling actually wrote, is the first on the Iranian market.<br><br>Knowing such horror stories, I feared the inevitable translation of my memoirs, Funny in Farsi, into Persian. Funny in Farsi is a collection of humorous vignettes, verbal snapshots of my immigrant family. In that book I was very careful not to cross the line into anything embarrassing or insulting. My goal was to have the subjects of my story laugh with me, not cringe and want to move to Switzerland under assumed names. But for all I knew, a translated version might make my family look like fools. Even though I had not used my maiden name in the original printing of the book, it took about twelve minutes for the average Iranian to figure out my last name, Jazayeri. Iranians are very good that way.<br><br>I decided to make my own preemptive strike and find a translator in Iran. This was not as easy as it sounds. Humor, like poetry, is culture-specific and does not always work in translation. What&#x2019;s downright hilarious in one culture may draw blank stares in another.<br><br>When we came to America, my family could not figure out why a pie thrown in someone&#x2019;s face was funny. The laugh tracks told us it was supposed to be hilarious, but we thought it was obnoxious. We also saw it as a terrible waste of food, a real no-no for anyone from any country in the world except for the United States.<br><br>We were also baffled by Carol Burnett&#x2019;s Tarzan yell. Anyone who watched her show regularly knew that during the audience question-and-answer section, one person would inevitably ask her to do her Tarzan yell. We always hoped she would say, &#x201c;Not tonight.&#x201d; But instead, she would let out a loud and long yell that left the audience in stitches and us bewildered. &#x201c;She shouldn&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; my dad always said. We agreed and waited for all her other sketches, which we loved. There was just something goofy about her that made us laugh, especially when she was with Tim Conway. His humor had much to do with facial expressions and body language, which, thankfully, did not require translation. There is also something universally funny about the contrast between a short man and a tall man, which was played out with Harvey Korman. Given that most of the men in my family are closer in height to Tim Conway than to Harvey Korman, I assume there was among us a nervous understanding of the foibles of the short man.<br><br>We also adored Flip Wilson, especially when he became Geraldine. That character sketch, with &#x201c;Geraldine&#x2019;s&#x201d; sassy attitude, had us rocking back and forth in laughter on our ugly brown striped sofa. One time, Flip Wilson sang &#x201c;He put the lime in the coconut&#x201d; in his high-pitched mock-sultry Geraldine voice, and my father laughed so hard that he cried. I didn&#x2019;t think it was that funny, but watching my father laugh made us all laugh. The odd thing is that thirty-five years later, my father still remembers some of the words to that song, singing it as Kazem imitating Flip Wilson imitating Geraldine. It sounds nothing like the original, especially when he ekes out a &#x201c;nee nee nee nee&#x201d; instead of the forgotten lyrics.<br><br>I knew that Funny in Farsi would be a difficult book to translate because so much of its humor has to do with the American culture of the seventies. How does one translate &#x201c;Shake &#x2019;n Bake&#x201d; for cultures where slow cooking, not speed and ease, is the preferred method of food preparation, where a woman standing in her kitchen shaking a drumstick in a plastic bag and looking downright happy would cause concern? How does one convey to someone who has never seen The Price Is Right that the words &#x201c;Come on down!&#x201d; are always followed by a hysterical person shrieking and jumping up and down?<br><br>Through my uncle, who knew someone who knew someone, I was put in touch with a well-known humor translator living in Iran. The same week I started corresponding with him I received a very polite e-mail from Mohammad, another translator in Iran, asking for permission to translate my book. I thanked him but told him I already had someone. I deleted his e-mail.<br><br>Before we had a chance to formally agree on anything, my designated translator became ill, and it was obvious that I would have to find someone else. I was stuck, since I had deleted Mohammad&#x2019;s e-mail. A month later, I received another e-mail from Mohammad telling me that he was still interested should I write another book. And this is how Mohammad Soleimani Nia, my translator, came into my life.<br><br>To test Mohammad&#x2019;s skill, I asked him to translate one of my stories. I was quite pleased with the results and knew that, serendipitously, I had stumbled upon the right person.<br><br>Then we got started. Mohammad translated story by story and e-mailed each one to me. My father and I read each one and I e-mailed back our comments, most of which had to do with nuance. My father particularly objected when Mohammad translated &#x201c;my father&#x2019;s receding hairline&#x201d; to &#x201c;my father&#x2019;s bald head.&#x201d; I immediately sent Mohammad an e-mail quoting my father exactly: &#x201c;I am not Yul Brynner!&#x201d; A profusely apologetic e-mail followed.<br><br>Some of Mohammad&#x2019;s mistakes revealed what life is like in the Middle East. In one story, I mentioned &#x201c;eyes meeting across a room and va va va boom.&#x201d; This was translated as &#x201c;eyes meeting across a room and bombs going off.&#x201d; I had to explain to Mohammad that, in America, &#x201c;boom&#x201d; is love.<br><br>In a story about Christmas, I wrote about &#x201c;the bearded fellow&#x201d; coming down people&#x2019;s chimneys. Mohammad translated this literally. In Iran, however, a &#x201c;bearded fellow&#x201d; coming down the chimney is not a happy thought. The idea of going to bed so a bearded man, Khomeini perhaps, can come down the chimney would not cause visions of sugarplums dancing in anyone&#x2019;s head. Instead, one would find frantic people packing their belongings, fast.<br><br>The title also had to change. Funny in Farsi is not funny in Farsi, or rather Persian, which is the correct name of the language in English. Saying, &#x201c;I speak Farsi,&#x201d; is like saying, &#x201c;I speak fran�ais.&#x201d; I was more than happy to let that title go since it has been the subject of many long e-mails from Iranians with far too much free time on their hands, accusing me of spreading misinformation about our vastly underappreciated culture. &#x201c;The language is called Persian!&#x201d; they tell me. I know. Please, should any reader, Iranian or otherwise, feel the urge to e-mail me with a complaint about the incorrect use of the word &#x201c;Farsi&#x201d; in the title of my previous book, please, instead, look up the words &#x201c;humorous alliteration.&#x201d;<br><br>In Iran, the title was changed to Atre Sombol, Atre Koj, meaning The Scent of Hyacinths, the Scent of Pine, which refers to the contrasting smells of the holidays. The Iranian New Year is associated with the scent of hyacinths, and Christmas, with the scent of pine&#x2014;not to mention the bearded fellow coming down the chimney, although technically, that should not smell.<br><br>Then it was time for the censors. No movie or book can be made in Iran without approval from the government. Although there are no written guidelines stating exactly what is prohibited, common sense dictates that in an Islamic theocracy, nudity, profanity, insulting the religion or government, and perhaps anything having to do with Paris Hilton are all no-nos. Aside from those guidelines, one is at the mercy of the individual government employee assigned to each book. I hoped my stories would end up in the hands of one of those fun-loving, laugh-a-minute censors who would wave his teacup in the air, declaring, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s change the name of that street again, this time to Firoozeh Dumas Avenue.&#x201d;<br><br>I asked Mohammad how long the government would take to return my book. Surprisingly, there are no guidelines there, either. Perhaps some sort of Oil-for-Guidelines program could be negotiated.<br><br>Mohammad told me that the translation for James Joyce&#x2019;s Ulysses has been at the censor&#x2019;s office for seventeen years. I imagined the bearded censor sitting as at his desk, book open, chin back, mouth open, snoring loudly. That&#x2019;s an example of a book that could use some nudity.<br><br>My stories were returned after six months. Three changes had to be made, two minor, one major.<br><br>The censor objected to my describing someone looking as if God had switched her nose with the beak of a toucan. One cannot blame God, I was told. In the Persian version, I reworded the sentence, using a passive voice, claiming that the woman&#x2019;s nose looked as if it had been switched. One would think that in a book of humor some things would be obvious, but apparently not. Perhaps I had written the equivalent of Carol Burnett&#x2019;s Tarzan yell.</p><h2>Sex Criminals Volume 5: Five-Fingered Discount</h2><p>Suzie and Jon have that special something -- when they have sex, they freeze time and do crimes.

This is a modern story of...<br><br>COUNTING COUP<br><br>In this extraordinary work of journalism, Larry Colton journeys into the world of Montana's Crow Indians and follows the struggles of a talented, moody, charismatic young woman named Sharon LaForge, a gifted basketball player and a descendant of one of George Armstrong Custer's Indian scouts. But "Counting Coup" is far more than just a sports story or a portrait of youth. It is a sobering expos� of a part of our society long since cut out of the American dream.<br><br>Along the banks of the Little Big Horn, Indians and whites live in age-old conflict and young Indians grow up without role models or dreams. Here Sharon carries the hopes and frustrations of her people on her shoulders as she battles her opponents on and off the court. Colton delves into Sharon's life and shows us the realities of the reservation, the shattered families, the bitter tribal politics, and a people's struggle against a belief that all their children -- even the most intelligent and talented -- are destined for heartbreak. Against this backdrop stands Sharon, a fiery, undaunted competitor with the skill to dominate a high school game and earn a college scholarship. Yet getting to college seems beyond Sharon's vision, obscured by the daily challenge of getting through the season -- physically and ps</p><p>Larry Colton lives in Portland, Oregon.The social dilemmas faced by present-day Native Americans are revealed in this journalistic look at a high school girls' basketball team in Crow, Montana.In a previous book, <i>Goat Brothers</i> (1993), Colton examined the lives of fraternity brothers from the 1960s to the 1990s. Here, he spends a season living and observing the Hardin High School girls' basketball team, a team comprised of white girls and Crow Indians. Although Colton manages to give a face to the different players, he is particularly fascinated by 17-year-old Sharon Laforge, an extremely talented American Indian who hopes to earn a college basketball scholarship, but whose future is threatened by several factors, including an absentee father, an alcoholic mother, a possessive and abusive boyfriend, an undisciplined lifestyle, and pressure from peers and community. The racial oppression that Native Americans still face, especially in small rural towns, is another factor. Hardin's population of 2,990 is 49 percent Crow Indian, and mistrust and misunderstanding exists between cultures: the Crows see the whites as having inherited privilege, and the working-class whites see the Crows as having access to government funds, services, and scholarships that they themselves cannot get. In addition, the emerging status of women, especially star athletes such as Sharon, threatens the downtrodden and jealous Crow men who traditionally are used to being in charge. "Counting coup," an Indian battle term that referred to warriors gaining honor, respect, and dignity, is now also a Hardin High School basketball term that refers to dominating one's opponent. In this <i>Hoop Dreams</i> for American Indians, Colton shows how a handful of girls try to count coup against opponents who appear on more than just the basketball court.Colton's account of the environment he witnesses, while not particularly enlightening, does provide good dramatic background for his story of the team's attempt to make, and win, the state championship. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Big cities and suburbs are considered more strategic, more influential, and more desirable places to live and work. After all, they're the centers for culture, arts, and education. More and more people are leaving small places and moving to big ones. As a ministry strategy, focusing on big places makes sense. But the gospel of Jesus is often unstrategic. In this book, pastor Stephen Witmer lays out an integrated theological vision for small-place ministry. Filled with helpful information about small places and with stories and practical advice from his own ministry, Witmer's book offers a compelling, comprehensive vision for small-place ministry today. Jesus loves small places, and when we care deeply about them and invest in them over time, our ministry becomes a unique picture of the gospel&#x2015;one that the world badly needs to see.</p><p>Stephen Witmer is the pastor of Pepperell Christian Fellowship in Pepperell, Massachusetts, and is an adjunct professor of New Testament at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He is also cofounder of Small Town Summits, an organization that serves rural churches and pastors."There are billions of people living in small places, yet they are often ignored by ministry-minded people like me. Sure, rural areas are downstream of mainstream ideas, innovation, and trends, but small places are thick with culture and rife with opportunity for gospel ministry: poverty, depression, suicide, racism, injustice, and souls stranded in sin unacquainted with the love of God in Christ Jesus. As Stephen points out, both rural and urban places are easily romanticized. What the world needs is Christians who value the small even in the big&#x2015;disciples who move slowly and are attentive enough to bring a grand gospel into the nooks and crannies of life. This book has just about everything you need to help you do that, especially if you live in a small place. It offers rigorous research on rural trends, demographics, and the subtleties of smallness; it motivates ministry in those areas with the gospel of grace; it equips you to develop a theological vision for the place of your calling; it immerses you in real stories of rural ministry; and it challenges urban ministry biases with winsome wit, but most of all it calls us to love in place and discover something more of the immeasurable love of God in Christ Jesus for all the world." (Jonathan Dodson, lead pastor of City Life Church, Austin, founder of gcdiscipleship.com, author of The Unbelievable Gospel and Here in Spirit)<br><br>"In an age when we tend to lionize big strategies, big churches, and big cities, Stephen Witmer movingly calls us back to faithfulness, not least when the sphere to which we have been called is small and unknown. Of course, it is not a question of either-or: <em>either</em> big cities <em>or</em> small towns and rural villages. Dr. Witmer does not try to force us into mutually exclusive worlds, but at a time when agendas favor the big and the urban, he patiently summarizes the biblical and theological evidence for underscoring the small and the overlooked. Read Witmer and (ironically) expand your vision." (Don Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, president and founder of The Gospel Coalition)<br><br>"Francis Schaeffer observed that there are no little people in God's sight and no little places: 'To be wholly committed to God in the place where God wants him&#x2015;this is the creature glorified.' There is a tendency these days to quantify the value of ministry. This thinking assumes that bigger is better. The larger the population is, the greater the need. Such a view tends to rule out small places. Stephen Witmer helps us to correct this by showing us that small places are much like everywhere else. They are also different. Witmer makes an informed and winsome case for the importance of doing ministry in the places that many of us are inclined to overlook. <em>A Big Gospel in Small Places</em> will help you to understand not only the need but the unique nature of today's forgotten communities." (John Koessler, professor of applied theology and church ministry, Moody Bible Institute)<br><br>"This is a book whose time has come. I've long appreciated Stephen Witmer's advocacy for ministry in the small places. And now we have an apologetic, a theological vision for this particular work. He makes the case for small places without patronizing them or denigrating ministry in other areas. I even appreciated his pushback to the urban thesis of the early church. That's what makes this book an important read, even if you could never imagine living in the places where Stephen and I grew up." (Collin Hansen, editorial director for The Gospel Coalition, coauthor of A God-Sized Vision: Revival Stories That Stretch and Stir)<br><br>"Stephen Witmer's latest book reminds me of my mom's Sunday dinners. The aroma of the well-prepared content drew me in, each savory mouthful deeply satisfied, and the lasting value has given me ongoing nourishment. I'm excited to invite church leaders from urban, suburban, and rural places to feast on this much-needed book. And like mom's Sunday meals, Stephen wrote the last chapter as a memorable dessert." (David Pinckney, pastor at River of Grace Church, Concord, NH, and codirector of Acts 29 Network's Rural Collective)<br><br>"<em>A Big Gospel in Small Places</em> provides an important contribution to the recent literature on small-town and rural ministry. Stephen Witmer reminds us that the recent interest in rural communities must not be a passing fad driven by popular culture but integrated into and driven by the fabric of our understanding of the gospel itself. The gospel is not just about reaching the masses, it is about lost people wherever they may live. It is about God's value of the unimportant and insignificant. Stephen reminds us that if we abandon the rural places in our mission, then we do more than neglect the spiritual plight of rural people, we neglect the gospel itself. For this reason alone, this book is a must-read for all denominational leaders, seminary professors and students, and those who desire to serve in small towns and rural communities." (Glenn Daman, senior pastor, River Christian Church, Stevenson Washington, author of The Forgotten Church)<br><br>"<em>A Big Gospel in Small Places</em> is an incredible book that really answers core questions of why ministering in forgotten communities matters. In this book, Stephen Witmer offers very practical advice and compelling theological vision that should make us all consider preaching the gospel both in big and small places. This book should be read by all pastors." (Robert Manda, codirector of Rural Collective Acts 29, pastor of New Life Church, Malawi, Africa)<br><br>"This is one of the more important books written about the gospel and missions in recent decades. Stephen Witmer takes the gospel seriously: he is more interested in the good news than in church-planting strategies. He takes people seriously: he is more concerned for people than for programs. He understands success in terms of faithfulness to God's calling rather than in terms of fame, in terms of the transformation of people's lives rather than in terms of the numerical size of a congregation. Here writes an academic who wears his scholarship lightly, a pastor who challenges his audience to think deeply, a follower of Jesus who follows Jesus to all the places where people live. Witmer explains that strategic thinking about ministry must acknowledge one of the great truths about God who lavishes his grace on city people, on small-town people, and on village people alike. This book is a pleasure to read, indeed a must-read for professors, students, and pastors who think about gospel ministry in the twenty-first century." (Eckhard J. Schnabel, Mary F. Rockefeller Distinguished Professor of New Testament, associate editor, Bulletin of Biblical Research)<br><br>"What a long-awaited, welcomed book! What rare, refreshing, and compelling insights that validate the selfless investments faithful men and women&#x2015;my heroes&#x2015;are making in places that some consider unstrategic. Thank you, Stephen Witmer, for stirring our thinking and quickening our hearts for mighty gospel-oriented work in small places!" (Ron Klassen, executive director of RHMA (Rural Home Missionary Association))<br><br>"What a breath of fresh air to understand the gospel as motivator and as the approach to ministry! That's exactly what Stephen Witmer helps us understand in <em>A Big Gospel in Small Places</em>. Clear, passionate, and biblical, Witmer's book lays a foundation for ministry that is rooted in the nature and content of the gospel. He pleads, 'Please think very big about things that are truly big: God's character, God's gospel, God's mercy, God's glory. Know, and firmly believe, and often remind yourself that these truly big things do not depend on the size of your place, your church, your ministry, or your reputation.' Stephen's call is to flesh out the gospel in whatever location or ministry God has called us to. This book will be extremely valuable for anyone in or considering ministry, and it is not just for those in small, forgotten places. But what an encouragement it will be for them! As director of Village Missions, a ministry that serves the forgotten places of rural America, I can't wait to start using and promoting this book!" (Brian S.

In this collection of personal and theoretical essays, hooks reflects on her signature issues of racism and feminism, politics and pedagogy. Among her discoveries is that moving from silence into speech is for the oppressed, the colonized, the exploited, and those who stand and struggle side by side, a gesture of defiance that heals, making new life and new growth possible.</p></p><p><p>A cultural critic, an intellectual, and a feminist writer, <b>bell hooks</b> is best known for classic books including <i>Ain&#x2019;t I a Woman, Bone Black, All About Love, Rock My Soul, Belonging, We Real Cool, Where We Stand, Teaching to Transgress, Teaching Community, Outlaw Culture</i>, and <i>Reel to Real. </i>hooks is Distinguished Professor in Residence in Appalachian Studies at Berea College, and resides in her home state of Kentucky.</p>Hooks, a pen name for Gloria Watkins, the author of Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism , here gathers essays that also focus on being black and feminist in America. She begins by recounting painful personal experiences: growing up in a repressive, Southern, "father-dominated household," attending a segregated high school, struggling to find her own, persuasive voice and become a writer, and learning to deal with racism and sexism while studying at "predominately white universities" in Wisconsin and California. Hooks then moves on to a general discussion of the women's movement and how "white supremacy" in our society adversely affects it. Although the author makes perceptive and provocative observations, they are diminished by redundancy and weakened by her doctrinaire Marxist rhetoric: "In resistance, the exploited, the oppressed work to expose the false realityto reclaim and recover ourselves. We make the revolutionary history." In addition, the author employs labels such as "got everything White people." Ultimately, she fails to convince or even to use her own voice. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Basic English Grammar with MyEnglishLab (4th Edition)</h2><p><p>The world's most trusted grammar source for clear, direct, and&nbsp;comprehensive instruction, the <b> <i>Azar-Hagen Grammar Series&nbsp;</i> </b>&#x2014; including <i>Basic English Grammar</i>&nbsp;for beginning&nbsp;English&nbsp;language learners&nbsp;&#x2014; blends&nbsp;grammar instruction with communicative methods.

As our environment faces evermore threats from human activities these core issues are becoming increasingly important.<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Robin Attfield traces the origins of environmental ethics as a discipline, and considers how it defends the independent value of living creatures, and the need to make decisions informed by the needs and interests of future generations. Exploring the diverse approaches to ethical decisions and judgements, he highlights the importance of making processes of production and consumption sustainable and of addressing human population levels, together with policies for preserving species, sub-species, and their habitats. Along the way Attfield discusses different movements such as Deep Ecology, Social Ecology, the Environmental Justice movement and the Green movement, and also considers the attitudes to the environment of the world's religions, including the approach from the major religions and the contributions of the indigenous religions of Asia, Africa and North America. Analyzing the current threat of climate change, and proposals for climate engineering, he demonstrates how responsibility for the environment ultimately lies with us all, from states and corporations to individuals, and emphasizes how concerted action is required to manage our environment ethically and sustainably.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

He is the best, and has even been described as a couturier of pastry. This is a man at the top of his art and there is no question his macarons are in a league of its own. Macarons are the aristocrats of pastry; these brightly colored, mini meringues, daintily sandwiched together with gooey fillings, have become a holy grail for cookery fanatics and there are even food blogs dedicated to them. Now for the first time, all the macaron recipes from this most celebrated French p�tissier are published in English. The French language edition has been one of the most sought after cookbooks of recent years. And just like Pierre Herm�&#x2019;s famous macarons, it would be difficult for any macaron book to surpass this one. There are 200 pages of recipes and beautiful food photography, and because making macarons is mostly about technique, rather than just a standard recipe, readers will appreciate the 32-step-by-step photo-illustrated instructions for making shells and fillings. All the classics are here like dark chocolate, praline, coffee, and pistachio, but others feature the more unusual macarons that Herm� is justly famous for: Isfahan is one, with lychee, rose and raspberry, Arabesque with apricot and pistachio, Satine with passion fruit, orange and cream cheese, Mandarin and pink pepper, black truffles, balsamic vinegar as well as a bright-green macaron filled with fresh mint.

Many of these stories are about men and a natural question arises, Are there women in the Bible? Do they have a place in the Church? It is a good question with a great answer. There are many women who are a vital part of salvation history and their stories are critical parts of Sacred Scripture. Do you know them? I Choose the Sky paints a beautiful portrait of just a handful of these women seventeen, in fact, whose stories are easily glossed over, but not easily forgotten. These women, heroic and virtuous, teach us something about the very fabric of human-kindness and God s love. This book is about their choice to raise their eyes heavenward despite difficulties and live their lives with hope, boldness, generosity, and great faith. This scriptural devotion will inspire young women to raise their heads along with Mary, Martha, Lydia, and Esther and look into the eyes of Jesus, the God who loves deeply and perfectly.</p><p>Emily Wilson is a speaker, author, and musician who travels the world sharing her faith through witness and worship.

But if Shipley has anything to say about it, they&#x2019;ll soon be incorporating lavender into their roster. Not just for sachets and bubble baths, lavender can be used (and is widely in France) in everything from iced tea to muffins to veal scaloppine.

Among the "earthy and flavorful" autumn plates are Taos Lavender Potato Soup and Lavender Mulled Wine. And in winter, home cooks might try "warming and hearty" Lavender Chicken Chili with White Beans. In experimenting with the more than 120 recipes, readers will learn that lavender goes well with red meat and can act as a catalyst to bring out other flavors in many unexpected dishes.

The Russian Federation under a populist authoritarian leader seriously threatens the West ideologically, through cyber-space and militarily thanks to that country s heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons. The People s Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of authoritarian communist leader focused on rapidly growing the world s most populous nation economically and militarily. Together, China and Russia collaborate on many fronts to dominate the future world and that relationship could well become the catalyst that leads to the biblical end times. The Alliance of Evil reveals ... *A realistic view of the prophetic scriptures regarding the end times and whether China, Russia and the United States are players in the final scenario. *Sixteen indicators of a new dual Cold War-like future with China and Russia pitted against the United States and her allies. *How the new dual Cold War is fanned by American arrogance, hubris which reflects the weakened, perhaps declining United States. *The similarities and differences between the old Cold War (1945-1991), United States versus the Soviet Union, and the new dual Cold War are stark, sobering and frightening. *How, as prophesied, China and Russia emerged as a new kind of great power duo which are now aligning themselves against the U.S. for a final showdown. *Four modern battlegrounds host the new dual Cold War confrontation; any one of which could well explode into apocalyptic global war. *How the Trump administration s national security strategy intends to shape the new dual Cold War international environment while avoiding kinetic conflict if that is possible. *A futuristic view of how the duo of Russia and China might morph into a real end times provoking catalyst thanks to previously unfathomable technologies such as hypersonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and artificial intelligent platforms as well as geopolitical relations that are only now beginning to emerge.</p><p></p><h2>Breath of Scandal</h2><p><b>Years after surviving a devastating attack, a young Southern woman returns to her hometown to exact revenge on the wealthy family who tried to destroy her.</b><br><br>On a rainy Southern night, Jade Sperry endured a young woman's worst nightmare at the hands of three local hell-raisers.

A much-loved teacher, well known for his combination of practical wisdom and spiritual insight, he gave his life to the service of humanity, demonstrating by his own example the means of finding abiding peace. His message of peace, both individual and universal, has been heard worldwide. Each year, he received hundreds of invitations to speak at conferences, colleges, medical groups, and houses of worship around the globe.The following is taken from Swami Satchidananda's preface to <b>Integral Yoga Hatha</b>. <p> WHAT IS INTEGRAL YOGA? Integral Yoga is a combination of specific methods designed to develop every aspect of the individual: physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. It is a scientific system which integrates the various branches of Yoga in order to bring about a complete and harmonious development of the individual. Every human being longs for true and lasting happiness. The path or means through which he attempts to find it varies according to the individual's development. He may strive for happiness by satisfying the physical, emotional, and intellectual aspects of his personality. Experience may teach him what sages and saints have been proclaiming throughout the ages, that true and lasting happiness cannot be based on that which is impermanent in its nature. True and lasting happiness can only be attained through the knowledge of the permanent or Divine which is the Indweller of all beings and the source of all life. It has been given such names as the Self, Nature, God, Brahman, Cosmic Consciousness, Infinity, the Thing in Itself, Nirvana, and so on. Since it is infinite, it can only be experienced when the individual rises above his limited personality. The body, emotions, and intellect must be developed to a level in which they function healthfully and in perfect harmony with each other. Only then can one live a happy life and use them as tools to transcend limitations and experience the Divine. </p><p> SOME OF THE MAIN BRANCHES OF YOGA </p><p> HATHA YOGA: Bodily postures (asanas), deep relaxation, breath control (pranayama), cleansing processes (kriyas), and mental concentration create a supple and relaxed body; increased vitality; radiant health; and help in curing physical illness. Through proper diet, the physical body undergoes a cleansing through which impurities and toxins are eliminated and at the same time vitamins and minerals are readily assimilated and used by the system. As the body and mind become purified and the practitioner gains mastery over his mind, he finally attains the goal of Yoga, Self Realization. </p><p> KARMA YOGA: The path of action through selfless service. By performing duty without attachment or desire for the results of action, the Karma Yogi purifies his mind. When the mind and heart are purified, the Karma Yogi becomes an instrument through which the Divine Plan or Work is performed. Thereby he transcends his individuality and experiences the Divine Consciousness. </p><p> BHAKTI YOGA: This is the path of love and devotion to God, a Divine Incarnation or the spiritual teacher. By constant love, thought, and service of the Divine, the individual transcends his limited personality and attains Cosmic Consciousness. the path of Bhakti or devotion can be practiced by everyone. All that is needed is faith and constant loving remembrance of God. </p><p> RAJA YOGA: This is the path of meditation and control of the mind. It is based on ethical and moral perfection and control of the senses which leads to concentration and meditation by which the mind can be stilled from its thoughts. Then all limitations are transcended and the state of Samadhi or Superconsciousness is experienced. </p><p> JAPA YOGA: Japa yoga is a part of Raja Yoga. Japa means repetition of a mantra. A mantra is a sound structure of one or more syllables which represents a particular aspect of the Divine vibration. Concentrated mental repetition of the mantra produces vibrations within the individual's entire system that are in tune with the Divine Vibration. </p><p> JNANA YOGA: This is the path of wisdom. It consists of self-analysis and awareness. The Jnana Yogi gains knowledge of the self by ceasing to identify himself with the body, mind, and ego. He completely identifies with the divinity within him and everything and realizes the oneness. </p><p> Integral Yoga is a synthesis of all Yogas. The goal is a body of perfect health and strength. Mind with all clarity, calmness and control. Intellect as sharp as a razor, will of steel, heart full of love and mercy, a life dedicated to the common welfare and Realization of the True Self. </p><p> In this book, Hatha Yoga will be reviewed. There are many, many books on this subject on shelves and libraries throughout the world. Because of this, I hesitated to add one more book to the market and perhaps even flood the river of existing material. It has only been through the urging of my students, who insisted on seeing my way of teaching also in print, that this book has been compiled. I truly hope it won't strain the category of Hatha information, but instead will be useful in a unique way, enabling the practitioner to gain from my personal practices and from the knowledge collected through teaching Hatha all over the globe for the past twenty-five years. </p><p> This book contains very little theoretical material, but has been set up as a sort of Hatha Yoga directory--including precise and simplified technical details plus pictures with each pose.</p></p><h2>Afro-Cuban Rhythms for Drumset</h2><p>Afro Cuban Rhythms For Drumset Book And CDCompanion CD The companion audio CD is invaluable to anyone interested in adapting these rhythms to the drum set.

Through five lengthy hospital stays, endless therapy, and the loss of family, friends, jobs, and all sense of what it means to be "normal," Marya Hornbacher lovingly embraced her anorexia and bulimia -- until a particularly horrifying bout with the disease in college put the romance of wasting away to rest forever. A vivid, honest, and emotionally wrenching memoir, <em>Wasted</em> is the story of one woman's travels to reality's darker side -- and her decision to find her way back on her own terms.</p></p><p>&#34;I fell for the great American dream, female version, hook, line, and sinker,&#34; Marya Hornbacher writes. &#34;I, as many young women do, honest-to-God believed that once I Just Lost a Few Pounds, suddenly I would be a New You, I would have Ken-doll men chasing my thin legs down with bouquets of flowers on the street, I would become rich and famous and glamorous and lose my freckles and become blond and five foot ten.&#34; Hornbacher describes in shocking detail her lifelong quest to starve herself to death, to force her short, athletic body to fade away. She remembers telling a friend, at age 4, that she was on a diet. Her bizarre tale includes not only the usual puking and starving, but also being confined to mental hospitals and growing fur (a phenomenon called lanugo, which nature imposes to keep a body from freezing to death during periods of famine).Precociously intelligent, imaginative, energetic, and ambitious, Marya Hornbacher grew up in a comfortable middle-class American home. At the age of five, she returned home from ballet class one day, put on a enormous sweater, curled up on her bed, and cried--because she thought she was fat. By age nine she was secretly bulimic, throwing up at home after school, while watching <i>Brady Bunch</i> reruns on television and munching Fritos. She added anorexia to her repetoire a few years later and took great pride in her ability to starve.<br><br>Marya's story gathers intensity with each passing year. By the time she is in college and working for a wire news service in Washington, D.C., she is in the grip of a bout of anorexia so horrifying that it will forever put to rest the romance of wasting away. Down to fifty-two pounds and counting, Marya becomes a battlefield: her powerful death instinct at war with the will to live.<br><br>Why would a talented young girl go through the looking glass and step into a netherworld where up is down, food is greed, and death is honor? Why enter into a love affair with hunger, drugs, sex, and death? Marya sustained both anorexia and bulimia through five lengthy hospitalizations, endless therapy, the loss of family, friends, jobs, and, ultimately, any sense of what it means to be "normal." In this vivid, emotionally wrenching memoir, she recreates the experience and illuminates the tangle of personal, family and cultural causes unlying eating disorders.<br><br><i>Wasted</i> is the story of one woman's travels to the darker side of reality, and her decision to find her way back again--on her own terms.</p><h2>Raggedy Andy Stories: Introducing the Little Rag Brother of Raggedy Ann</h2><p>Since Raggedy Andy first appeared in print in 1920, he has delighted millions of readers with his adventurous spirit and compassionate nature. Now he returns to captivate a new generation in this carefully produced reissue, which restores the book to its original appearance.<br>All the original stories are here, as Raggedy Andy arrives in the mail at Marcella's father's office, displays his cheery smile, and is eagerly reunited with his sister, Raggedy Ann. After a warm welcome from the other dolls, Raggedy Andy adds to their fun with a dance, a pillow fight, and a taffy pull. His merry escapades frequently show his generosity in helping others, as he bravely ventures into the gutter to find the penny dolls, "cures" the French doll, and encourages the wooden horse. Other stories also include Raggedy Andy and the other dolls' encounters with the Easter bunny, Santa Claus, and a beautiful seashell.<br>Johnny Gruelle's delicate illustrations are the perfect companion to the well-loved stories in this American classic, the only edition authorized by the Gruelle family. A brief biography of the author-artist by his grandson, Kim Gruelle, makes this edition especially valuable.</p><p>Johnny Gruelle's first collection of stories featuring Raggedy Ann was published in 1918. These tales, illustrated by Gruelle's own charming and brightly colored drawings, were inspired by his daughter Marcella's devotion to a rag doll that has originally belonged to her grandmother. <i>Raggedy Ann Stories </i>was the first of a series of forty books. In 1920, Gruelle brought out <i>Raggedy Andy Stories.</i><br>Gruelle called his rag-doll boy "the little rag brother of Raggedy Ann." In this new Derrydale book of the best stories and art from the first edition, Raggedy Andy is introduced to all the other dolls in Marcella's nursery for the first time, and adventure after adventure follows. All the favorite doll characters from <i>Raggedy Ann Stories</i> are here: the French doll, Uncle Clem, Henny the Dutch doll, as well as Marcella's mischievous dog Fido. As a special treat, the denizens of the nursery are visited by such childhood celebrities as Santa Claus and the Easter bunny.<br>Included in this new edition, which beautifully recreates the layout of the original using all-new type, are the full-color illustrated stories "How Raggedy Andy Came," "The Nursery Dance," "The Spinning Wheel," "The Taffy Pull," "The Rabbit Chase," "Raggedy Andy's Smile, "The Wooden Horse," and "Making 'Angels' in the Snow."Johnny Gruelle was an extremely talented cartoonist, illustrator, and storyteller. He had already written and illustrated a book of original fairy tales before creating the Raggedy Ann and Andy stories. Raggedy Ann, heroine of the first book, was a favorite doll of his daughter, Marcella, who died after a long illness at the age of thirteen. Johnny Gruelle eventually created over forty Raggedy Ann and Andy books, all capturing his unique version of childhood.<br><br>Johnny Gruelle was an extremely talented cartoonist, illustrator, and storyteller.

Desiree Dieu Donne, a black peasant girl, saves the life of Daniel Beauxhomme, a wealthy mulatto whose family has renounced its black origins. Daniel is returned to his home, but Desiree, convinced that it is the will of the gods, sets out on an arduous quest to find the Palace Beauxhomme. The two fall in love. The peasant girl is not acceptable to the island aristocracy, however, and Daniel consents to wed a woman of his own class. [...] This allegory abounds in vivid, sensual images and symbols, many of which parallel Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid , on which it is based. [...] Some young adults who enjoy the fast-paced realism and memorable characterizations of the author's other books may be disappointed in the allegorical romantic mood and the story's illusive and allusive symbolism. Other readers, however, will find the message particularly relevant and will be moved by the tragic love story so eloquently captured by Guy's lilting prose. Jackie Gropman, Fairfax County Pub .

In this meticulously researched narrative spanning 1903 to 1974, David G. Garc�a excavates an extensive array of archival sources to expose a separate and unequal school system and its purposeful links with racially restrictive housing covenants. He recovers powerful oral accounts of Mexican Americans and African Americans who endured disparate treatment and protested discrimination. His analysis is skillfully woven into a compelling narrative that culminates in an examination of one of the nation&#x2019;s first desegregation cases filed jointly by Mexican American and Black plaintiffs. This transdisciplinary history advances our understanding of racism and community resistance across time and place.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Strategies of Segregation</i> is a carefully researched, effectively argued, and beautifully written study of the centrality of school segregation to the racialization of space and the spatialization of race in Oxnard, California. Its deft blend of evidence from archival and oral history sources makes a major contribution to the histories of school and residential segregation. This fine book also reveals how Mexican Americans and Blacks fought back and battled for educational equity and racial justice.&#x201d;&#x2014;George Lipsitz, author of <i>The Possessive Investment in Whiteness</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Through a study of how school segregation and residential segregation reinforce one another,&nbsp;<i>Strategies of Segregation</i>&nbsp;examines how structural racism became embedded in Oxnard, a city just north of Los Angeles. David G. Garc�a&#x2019;s analysis across multiple urban institutions and interlocking racial practices will make this a model book for years to come.&#x201d;&#x2014;Natalia Molina, author of <i>How Race Is Made in America: Immigration, Citizenship, and the Historical Power of Racial Scripts</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Garc�a offers an original interpretation of school segregation and racial subordination with a rich and well-documented foundation of primary sources that vividly recreate schemes to subordinate Mexicans and African Americans in Oxnard. This outstanding book speaks to national issues of segregation, racial inequality, and resistance and will command the attention of the larger academy.&#x201d;&#x2014;James D. Anderson, author of <i>The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860&#x2013;1935 &nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Strategies of Segregation</i> is a provocative and engaging book that will broaden our understanding of the history of Mexican American education.

The Boot cut his teeth battling the Jewish gang lord Abner Longy Zwillman on the streets of Newark during Prohibition and endured to become one of the East Coast&#x2019;s top mobsters, his reign lasting six decades. <br><br>To the press and the police, this secretive Don insisted he was nothing more than a simple man who enjoyed puttering about in his beloved vegetable garden on his Livingston, New Jersey, estate. In reality, the Boot was a confidante and kingmaker of politicians, a friend of such celebrities as Joe DiMaggio and George Raft, an acquaintance of Joseph Valachi&#x2014;who informed on the Boot in 1963&#x2014;and a sworn enemy of J. Edgar Hoover. <br><br>The Boot prospered for more than half a century, remaining an active boss until the day he died at the age of ninety-three. Although he operated in the shadow of bigger Mafia names across the Hudson River (think Charles "Lucky" Luciano and Louis &#x201c;Lepke&#x201d; Buchalter, a cofounder of the Mafia killer squad Murder Inc. with Jacob &#x201c;Gurrah&#x201d; Shapiro), the Boot was equally as brutal and efficient. In fact, there was a mysterious place in the gloomy woods behind his lovely garden&#x2014;a furnace where many thought the Boot took certain people who were never seen again.<br><br>Richard Linnett provides an intimate look inside the Boot&#x2019;s once-powerful Mafia crew, based on the recollections of a grandson of the Boot himself and complemented by never-before-published family photos. Chronicled here are the Prohibition gang wars in New Jersey as well as the murder of Dutch Schultz, a Mafia conspiracy to assassinate Newark mayor Kenneth Gibson, and the mob connections to several prominent state politicians. <br><br>Although the Boot never saw the 1972 release of <i>The Godfather</i>, he appreciated the similarities between the character of Vito Corleone and himself, so much so that he hung a sign in his beloved vegetable garden that read &#x201c;The Godfather Garden.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s no doubt he would have relished David Chase&#x2019;s admission that his muse in creating the HBO series <i>The Sopranos</i> was none other than &#x201c;Newark&#x2019;s erstwhile Boiardo crew.&#x201d;</p><p>RICHARD LINNETT was born in Newark, New Jersey and was educated at George Washington University and Columbia University Graduate School of the Arts.

Their trendy neighborhood will be ruined unless Brooklyn and her fianc�, Derek Stone, can persuade the shopkeepers not to sell.<br>&nbsp;<br>But with a rare edition of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> causing bad blood at the Brothers Bookshop and a string of petty vandalism making everyone nervous, Brooklyn and Derek feel overwhelmed. Then the owner of the Rabbit Hole juice bar is felled by his own heavy shelves, and the local cobbler lies dead beside him. Things get curiouser and curiouser when a second priceless copy of <i>Alice</i> is discovered. <br>&nbsp;<br>As the Brits descend, Brooklyn learns they're not so stuffy after all. Derek's dad is won over with chocolate cream pie, and his psychic mum would <i>kill</i> to help Brooklyn solve this murder--before another victim takes a tumble.</p><p>A native Californian, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author <b>Kate Carlisle</b> worked in television for many years before turning to writing. A lifelong fascination with the art and craft of bookbinding led her to write the Bibliophile Mysteries featuring Brooklyn Wainwright, whose bookbinding and restoration skills invariably uncover old secrets, treachery, and murder. She is also the author of the Fixer-Upper Mysteries featuring small-town girl Shannon Hammer, a building contractor specializing in home restoration.Chapter One<br><br> Lately, I have resorted to stalking. Not a person, but a book.<br><br> For weeks now I'd been visiting the book almost daily. It was a little embarrassing to continually beg the bookstore owner to let me hold it, page through it, study it. I just wanted to touch it, stroke it, and once, when he wasn't looking, sniff it. But he didn't seem to mind my fixation. He's as big a book nerd as I am.<br><br> The owner kept the book inside a clear, locked glass case displayed on the shop's front counter, so it was pretty obvious he didn't want people touching it. And who could blame him? The book was exquisitely bound in vibrant red morocco leather. Rich gilding swirled along the spine, spelling out the title, author's name, and year of publication in fancy gold script. More gilding outlined the thick raised cords that lent gravitas to the already weighty tome.<br><br> In the center of the front cover was a brightly gilded rabbit wearing a topcoat. The well-dressed creature glanced down at a watch he held at the end of a chain, and he appeared nervous, as though he might be running late for some important event.<br><br> The fact that a gilded illustration could convey real emotion was pretty awesome, above and beyond the binding work. The first time I saw it, I checked the inside cover for the bookbinder and was thrilled to find the name George Bayntun of London. Favored by the late Queen Mary, Bayntun's bindery in Bath, England, was world renowned and was still operating to this day. I'd visited once and had come away starstruck.<br><br> On the back cover of the book was another elaborately raised figure in gold, an odd-looking woman wearing a crown and carrying a scepter. The red queen. She appeared headstrong and irate, as though she might order someone's head lopped off at any moment.<br><br> The book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, of course. This copy was a fairly hard-to-find version in excellent condition, with dark green-and-red-marbled endpapers and virtually no foxing on its clean white pages. It contained dozens of classic illustrations by the famous artist John Tenniel. The binding was tight and even. And I wanted it.<br><br> My name is Brooklyn Wainwright, and I'm a bookbinder specializing in rare-book restoration. I love books of all kinds, and I love my job. It was exciting to know that I could give tired, torn, droopy, bug-bitten books a brand-new life that would allow them to continue to bring enjoyment for hundreds of years to come. It might have sounded boring to some, but in my career so far I had saved dozens of treasured childhood favorites from being thrown away, rescued any number of priceless museum-quality books from being carted off to the used-book store, and even solved a murder or two-or ten-while I was at it. Just in case you thought bookbinding sounded like a yawn-fest, trust me, my life was rarely dull.<br><br> This particular copy of Alice didn't need restoring, though. It was pristine. I wanted it because I had a fascination-okay, call it an obsession-with the iconic Alice and her creator, Lewis Carroll.<br><br> I gazed longingly at the book on display near the front counter of Brothers Bookshop. The store was a book nerd's dream: a cozy, tome-filled haven for people like me who were content to while away an entire day browsing the shelves in hopes of discovering the perfect little gem of a book to sink into.<br><br> The shop carried both new and used books along with all sorts of charming gifts and cards and paper goods. There were comfy chairs in every corner of the store, and a small section along one side was devoted to antiquarian books.<br><br> A magazine section was located at the back of the shop. At the front, a wall of windows looked out onto the neighborhood, and from there I could see my vintage apartment building on the other side of the street.<br><br> Derek Stone and I had decided to walk over here to do a little book browsing on our way next door to shop for vegetables for dinner.<br><br> The bookshop was part of a group of small stores located in a charming three-story Victorian-era building across the street from us. The building, known as the Courtyard, formed a large square, with four shops on each side. Above each shop were two floors with one spacious apartment on each floor. In the interior of the square was a delightful little courtyard overflowing with flowers and trees and several groupings of chairs and small tables. It was the perfect place to enjoy a caffe latte and read a book.<br><br> "Hi, Eddie," I said to the bookshop owner as I inched closer to the display.<br><br> "Hey, Brooklyn," Eddie Cox said without glancing up from his perch at the front counter. He knew it was me. Probably had seen me hovering nearby for the last few minutes. "I suppose you want to get another look at the book."<br><br> "I do," I said. "How did you know?"<br><br> He chuckled. "Just a lucky guess. Might have something to do with the fact that you show up here every other day and beg to see it."<br><br> All too true. But at least so far I hadn't drooled on the glass case. "And here I thought I was being so subtle."<br><br> "Subtle. Right." Still chuckling, he opened the drawer beneath the cash register and pulled out a small set of keys. I had known Eddie Cox and his brother-in-law, Terrence Payton, for almost four years, ever since I'd moved in across the street from Brothers Bookshop. The two men owned the charming shop together, and yes, I was there almost every other day because, you know, books.<br><br> Eddie carefully handed me the Alice, and it was all I could do not to clutch it to my chest in excitement. Instead, I put it down on the counter and ran my finger across the smooth leather cover.<br><br> Eddie raised an eyebrow. "I don't do this for everyone, you know."<br><br> "I know you don't, and I really appreciate you doing it for me. I'll be careful."<br><br> "I know you will." He winked at me. "Otherwise, I wouldn't allow it anywhere near your greedy little hands."<br><br> With a quick laugh, I scanned the store and spied Derek at the end of the middle aisle, where the latest mysteries and thrillers were displayed. He appeared to be involved in one particular book, so I knew I had a few minutes to enjoy the Alice. I opened it slowly, turning as always to the title page, where the publication date was posted: 1866.<br><br> This copy was considered a first edition, but actually it wasn't. The original version of the book had been published the year before, in 1865, but those books had been taken off the market by Lewis Carroll when his illustrator, John Tenniel, stated that the quality of his drawings had been poorly reproduced.<br><br> That earlier, 1865 version was known as the "Suppressed Alice" or the "Sixty-five Alice." All of those books were returned to the publisher except for fifty author copies that Lewis Carroll had kept for himself.<br><br> Eventually, most of those author copies had ended up in others' hands. Very few remained on the market today, and any that did were considered beyond rare. One had been auctioned off recently for almost two million dollars.<br><br> I would probably never get my hands on such a rare treasure as that, but I was perfectly happy with the one I currently held in my hands. This book was as fine as any I'd ever seen.<br><br> "Hello, Brooklyn."<br><br> I turned and saw Eddie's brother-in-law standing nearby. "Terrence. Hello."<br><br> "Is he going to sell you the book this time?" Terrence asked with a twinkle in his eye.<br><br> "I don't know." Glancing at Eddie, I bit back a smile. I knew he wouldn't sell it to me, since I'd tried to buy it a few hundred times before. But no harm in trying again. "What about it, Eddie? Will you sell me this book?"<br><br> "Never," Eddie insisted, as always. Then he added, "It was a gift from a very special friend."<br><br> "Wow." He'd never mentioned that before. I gazed at the book in my hand. "Must be a nice friend."<br><br> "I had a book just like that," Terrence grumbled. "But someone stole it."<br><br> "Are you kidding?" Did I look as confused as I felt? "You had a copy of this same book?"<br><br> Eddie barely suppressed an eye roll. "Terrence always claims that, but where's the proof?"<br><br> "I said it was stolen." Terrence's eyes narrowed in on Eddie, and I suddenly wondered if he suspected his own brother-in-law had taken the book from him.<br><br> Eddie shrugged. "That's why I keep mine locked inside this shatterproof case, right here in plain sight where everyone can see it, which means no one can steal it. I'm no fool."<br><br> "I'm not a fool, either." Terrence huffed, clearly insulted. He turned to me. "I'll have you know, my copy was locked inside the safe in my closet upstairs. Fat lot of good that did me," he added, muttering.<br><br> "You're just not as lucky as I am," Eddie said with a crooked grin as he flexed his biceps. "Or as manly."<br><br> I laughed, but Terrence was not amused. He continued to glower, shaking his head. "You're the fool. I'm as lucky as anyone else. Except when it comes to in-laws."<br><br> They were both ignoring me now. Over the last few years, I'd realized that the two men butted heads more often than not. Family was never easy, but still . . . If you didn't get along with your brother-in-law, why go into business with him?<br><br> The two men were in their forties and fairly nice-looking in different ways. Eddie had a classic runner's physique, tall and slim, with silver hair and a rakish goatee, which suited him. Terrence was a few inches shorter and bulkier, but most of his girth was muscle. He looked as though he might've been a boxer in his youth.<br><br> The two men had married sisters who divorced them within weeks of each other and moved to Florida together. I got the feeling that Eddie and Terrence didn't miss their ex-wives too much. They were both book fanatics who spent all of their time in the bookshop. I'd never known them to take a day off.<br><br> Handing the book back to Eddie, I tried to veer our conversation around to the original subject. "Not that you both don't deserve the very finest things, but who in their right mind would give up such a beautiful book?"<br><br> Eddie wiggled his eyebrows and grinned slyly. "A generous person who recognizes greatness, I suppose."<br><br> It was Terrence's turn to roll his eyes. I started to grin, but something bumped into my ankle and I jolted. Glancing down, I saw Furbie, the bookshop cat, staring up at me with his teeth clenching a stuffed mouse. Stuffed with catnip was my guess, if Furbie's lazy gaze meant anything.<br><br> "Hello, Furbie," I murmured, and reached down to scratch the soft gray fur around his ears. "Aren't you a pretty kitty?"<br><br> In response to the flattery, he dropped the toy at my feet. I picked it up and tossed it a few yards down the nearest aisle, expecting the frisky cat to pounce after it. Instead, he gave me a censorious look, tossed his head imperiously, and sidled awkwardly after the mouse.<br><br> "I think Furbie's drunk," I said.<br><br> "It's Terrence's fault," Eddie claimed. "He's an enabler."<br><br> "You're just jealous," Terrence retorted, "because Furbie likes me best."<br><br> "Of course he does, because you feed him catnip and empower his bad behavior." Eddie turned to me. "I'm the disciplinarian."<br><br> "You're just a meanie," Terrence muttered, and they were off on another squabble-fest, this time over the cat. These two would tangle over anything!<br><br> After letting them go off for a few more seconds, I tried to steer them back to the topic of Terrence's missing book.<br><br> "When did you lose your copy of Alice?" I asked Terrence as Eddie unlocked the glass case and gingerly slipped his Alice back inside.<br><br> "I didn't lose it."<br><br> "Sorry. When was it stolen?"<br><br> Terrence thought for a moment. "I guess it's been about six months."<br><br> In the grand scheme of tragedies, I knew this would come in low on the list. But as a book person, I really felt bad for him. "I'm sorry, Terrence."<br><br> "Yes," he said pointedly, still glaring at Eddie, "so am I."<br><br> Eddie put the key to the case back in the drawer and turned to Terrence. "You should be more careful."<br><br> "Oh, shut up."<br><br> Eddie grinned at me, a silent acknowledgment that he had just won this little argument. Their bickering was usually more good-natured, but this time Terrence looked truly offended, which worried me a little. It seemed like they might have quarreled over the stolen book before.<br><br> Derek approached and placed a short stack of books on the front counter.<br><br> "What have you got there?" I asked.<br><br> "I found a few spy novels I thought my father might enjoy."<br><br> "Oh. That's nice." But my stomach gave a little twist at the mention of his father. Derek's parents were going to be visiting from England for the first time the following week, and I still wasn't ready to meet them.<br><br> Derek and I had been together three years, and the one time I'd traveled to England with him, his parents had been away on an anniversary cruise around the Mediterranean. Now that he and I were getting married, it seemed ridiculous that I'd never met them. But as Derek arranged for their whirlwind trip to San Francisco, I found myself growing more and more uneasy about our first encounter.<br><br> Would they like me? It sounded so neurotic to worry, but these were my future in-laws! Of course I was worried. But still, I was sure they were wonderful, and I knew we would all love one another. They had to be the nicest people in the world because Derek was simply a delightful man. But they were English. I had lived in London for a short while years ago, and I truly loved the people, but there was a reserve to some of them that I didn't always understand. I had been raised in a thoroughly American peace-and-love commune founded by fans of the Grateful Dead, and I still wore Birkenstocks to prove it. My family was boisterous and fun loving. I simply couldn't imagine what Derek's parents would think of me. And Derek, while awesome, could be intimidating to others when he wanted to be. At times it was one of his best attributes. But it made me wonder if his parents might be intimidating as well.</p><h2>Woodturning: A Foundation Course</h2><p><p><strong>Get the latest edition of this international bestseller, it&#x2019;s better than ever. </strong>Because turning is a hot topic with both aspiring and seasoned woodworkers, <strong><em>Woodturning - a Foundation Course</em></strong> has enjoyed immense popularity.

Where do we come from? Where are we going? What are we living for? Why are we living?" <br><br>The answers to these questions can be discovered if one knows where and how to look.<br><br>No matter who we are, we feel fulfillment, happiness, and purpose inside of ourselves. These qualities are not felt outside of ourselves, and cannot be found in external things or circumstances. Similarly, knowledge of ourselves and our purpose cannot be found in external things, but are found inside. By knowing what is in our hearts and minds, by seeing what we usually ignore, we learn not only what we are capable of, but also what prevents us from developing our full potential.<br><br>By knowing ourselves, we acquire the knowledge of how to change for the better. As we improve ourselves and awaken to our true nature, we spontaneously begin to radiate the light of divinity in everything we do, increasing our own happiness, and spreading it to others. This is how we begin to live the Gnostic message, which states that the light of the Divine is within us. By knowing ourselves, we also learn about that light, and can bring it into the world to benefit everyone.<br><br>"All things, all circumstances that occur outside ourselves on the stage of this world, are exclusively the reflection of what we carry within. With good reason then, we can solemnly declare that the 'exterior is the reflection of the interior.' When someone changes internally&#x2013;and if that change is radical&#x2013;then circumstances, life, and the external also change." - Samael Aun Weor<br><br>This book reflects and illuminates the spiritual psychology of all genuine religions and mystical traditions. With the practical guidance in this book, anyone can awaken to see the light for the Divine for themselves.</p><p>The name Samael Aun Weor is Hebrew and is pronounced sam-ayel on vay-ohr. Samael Aun Weor wrote over sixty books, gave thousands of lectures, and formed the worldwide Gnostic Movement, whose members number in the millions. And yet, in spite of his wisdom and generosity towards mankind, he said: &#34;Do not follow me. I am just a signpost. Reach your own Self-realization.&#34; His lifelong mission was to deliver to humanity the total and exact science to develop the complete human being, that mysterious and ancient wisdom long hidden in the bosom of every great religion.Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? What are we living for? Why are we living? <br><br>Unquestionably, the wretched "intellectual animal," mistakenly called a human being, not only ignores, but furthermore ignores that he ignores. <br><br>The worst of it is the strange and difficult situation in which we find ourselves; we ignore the secret of all our tragedies, yet we are convinced that we know it all. <br><br>Just send a "rational mammal" to the middle of the Sahara desert, one of those who claims to be influential in life; leave him there, far away from any oasis, and observe from an airplane what occurs. <br><br>Facts will speak for themselves: the "intellectual humanoid," though he boasts that he is powerful and believes he is a real human being, turns out to be frightfully weak. <br><br>The "rational animal" is one hundred percent stupid; he thinks the best of himself. He thinks he can develop his potential via kindergarten, good manners, elementary and secondary schools, diplomas, universities, the prestige of daddy, etc. <br><br>Unfortunately, in spite of so much education, good manners, titles, and money, we know very well that any stomachache saddens us, and that deep down we continue being unhappy and miserable. <br><br>It is enough to read universal history to find out that we are still the same barbarians of the past, and instead of improving, we have become worse. <br><br>This present century with its magnificence, wars, prostitution, world-wide sodomy, sexual degeneration, drugs, alcohol, exorbitant cruelty, extreme perversion, monstrosity, etc., is the mirror in which we must see ourselves; there is not a good enough reason to boast of having reached a superior stage of development. <br><br>To think that time means progress is absurd; unfortunately, the "learned ignoramuses" continue to be bottled up in the "dogma of evolution..." <br><br>In all the somber pages of "dark history" we find the same atrocious cruelties, ambitions, wars, etc. <br><br>Nevertheless, our "super-civilized" contemporaries are still convinced that what we hear about war is secondary, a fleeting accident that has nothing to do with their so boasted "modern civilization."<br><br>Indeed, what is important is the way of being of each person. Some subjects will be drunkards; others will be abstemious, some honest and others shameless; there is everything in life. <br><br>The populace is the sum of all individuals. The populace is what the individual is; it is the government, etc. ...<br><br>The populace, then, is the extension of the individual...</p><h2>Day Hiking Snoqualmie Region: Cascade Foothills * I90 Corridor * Alpine Lakes, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�&nbsp;Covers the area with the easiest access for Seattle metro&#x2019;s 3 million residents<br>�&nbsp;35 all-new hikes added<br>�&nbsp;Nearly 25,000 copies sold of the first edition</p><p><br>The Snoqualmie region is within easy day-hiking distance for Seattle area hikers, but it&#x2019;s the abundance of stunning scenery that draws most outdoor lovers to these trails.

Compared to him Hitler, Stalin, Attila the Hun and even Alexander the Great were amateurs, <em>poseurs</em> who could not hold a candle to Otto and his body count.</p><p>Only one person was worse.</p><p>Cyrus Jakoby.</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t his real name, and in a way he had no real name. Like Otto, Cyrus was a freak. Like Otto, Cyrus was a monster.</p><p>A week ago I&#x2019;d never even heard of them. Almost no one had. A week ago they were on no watch lists, they were not sought by any world governments, their names were not muttered in hateful curses or angry prayers by a single person on planet earth.</p><p>Yet together they had done more harm than anyone. Together they had very quietly slaughtered tens of millions.</p><p>Tens of millions.</p><p>At night, when they sat down to their dinner they did not dwell on past accomplishments. A champion athlete doesn&#x2019;t dwell on the preliminaries. To them it was always what was coming next. What was coming <em>soon.</em></p><p>One week ago, seven days before I even heard of them, Otto Wirths placed a large digital clock on the wall above the elaborate workstation where he and Cyrus spent much of their waking hours. The clock was set to tick off seconds and minutes. Otto adjusted it to read 10,080. Ten thousand and eighty minutes.</p><p>One hundred and sixty eight hours.</p><p>Seven days.</p><p>One week.</p><p>After he pressed the start button, Otto and Cyrus clinked glasses of <em>Perrier-Jouet</em>, which--at over six thousand dollars a bottle--was the world&#x2019;s most expensive champagne. </p><p>They sipped the bubbles and smiled and watched the first sixty seconds tick away, and then the next sixty.</p><p>The Extinction Clock had begun.</p><p>(2)</p><p>NOW</p><p>I crouched in the dark. I was bleeding and something inside was broken. Maybe something inside my head, too. </p><p>The door was barred. I had three bullets left. Three bullets and a knife.</p><p>The pounding on the door was like thunder. I knew the door wouldn&#x2019;t hold.</p><p><em>They</em> would get in.</p><p>Somewhere the Extinction Clock was ticking down. If I was still in this room when it hit zero more people would die than perished during the Black Death and all of the pandemics put together.</p><p>I thought I could stop them.</p><p>I had to stop them. It was down to me or no one.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t my fault I came into this so late. They chased us and messed with our heads and ran us around and by the time we knew what we were up against the clock had already nearly run its course.</p><p>We tried. Over the last week I&#x2019;d left a trail of bodies behind me from Denver to Costa Rica to the Bahamas. Some of those bodies were human. Some...well, I don&#x2019;t know what the hell you&#x2019;d call them.</p><p>The pounding was louder. The door was buckling, the crossbar bending. It was only seconds before the lock or the hinges gave out, and then they&#x2019;d come howling in here. Then it would be them against me.</p><p>I was hurt. I was bleeding.</p><p>I had three bullets and a knife.</p><p>I got to my feet and faced the door, my gun in my left hand, the knife in my right.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>Let them come.</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>HUNTERS</p><p>&#x201c;There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter.&#x201d;</p><p>Ernest Hemingway</p><p>&#x201c;On the Blue Water,&#x201c; Esquire, April 1936</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Holy Redeemer Cemetery, Baltimore, MD</p><p>Saturday, August 28; 8:04 am /Time Remaining on the Extinction Clock: 97 hours; 56 minutes</p><p>&#x201c;Detective Ledger?&#x201d; he said and held out an ID case. &#x201c;NSA.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you spell that?&#x201d;</p><p>Not a flicker of a smile touched the concrete slab of his face. He was as big as me and the three goons with him were even bigger. All of them in sunglasses with American flags pinned on their chests. Why does this stuff always seem to happen to me?</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like you to come with us,&#x201d; said the guy with the flat face.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; We were in the parking lot of Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Baltimore. I had a mixed bunch of bright yellow daffodils in one hand and a bottle of spring water in the other. I had a pistol tucked into the back of my jeans under an Orioles away-game shirt. I never used to bring a piece to Helen&#x2019;s grave, but over the last few months things have changed. Life&#x2019;s become more complicated, and the gun was a habit 24/7. Even here.</p><p>The Goon Squad was definitely packing. Three right-handers and one lefty. I could see the faint bulges even under the tailored suits. The lefty was the biggest of the bunch, a moose with steroid shoulders and a nose that looked like it had been punched at least once from every possible angle. If things got weird he&#x2019;d be the grabby type. The guys on either side of him were pretty-boys; they&#x2019;d keep their distance and draw on me. Right now they were about fourteen feet out and their sports coats were unbuttoned. Smooth.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like you to come with us,&#x201d; Slab-face said again.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you. I asked &#x2018;why?&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, Detective--.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Captain Ledger, actually.&#x201d; I put a bit of frost in it even though I kept a smile on my face.</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Have a nice day,&#x201d; I said and started to turn. The guy next to Slab-face&#x2014;the one with the crooked nose--put his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>I stopped and looked down at his big hand and then up at his face. I didn&#x2019;t say a word and he didn&#x2019;t move his hand. There were four of them and one of me. The Nose probably thought that gave them a clean edge, and since NSA guys are pretty tough he was probably right. On the other hand these guys tend to believe their own hype, and that can come back to bite you. I don&#x2019;t know how much they knew about me, but if this clown had his hand on me then they didn&#x2019;t know enough. </p><p>I tapped his wrist with the bunch of daffodils. &#x201c;You mind?&#x201d;</p><p>He removed his hand, but he stepped closer. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make this complicated.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<em>&#x2019;Why&#x2019;</em>,&#x2019;&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;is not a complicated question.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave me a millimeter of a smile. &#x201c;National security.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bullshit. I&#x2019;m <em>in</em> national security. Go through channels.&#x201d;</p><p>Slab-face touched the Nose&#x2019;s shoulder and moved him aside so he could look me in the eyes. &#x201c;We were told to bring you in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who signed the order?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Detective...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There you go again,&#x201d;</p><p>Slab-face took a breath through his nose. &#x201c;<em>Captain</em> Ledger.&#x201d; He poured enough acid in it to melt through battleship armor.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; I asked. He hadn&#x2019;t held the ID up long enough for me to read it.</p><p>He paused. &#x201c;Special Agent John Andrews.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what, Andrews, this is how we&#x2019;re going to play it. I&#x2019;m going to go over there and put flowers on the grave of my oldest and dearest friend&#x2013;a woman who suffered horribly and died badly. I plan to sit with her for a while and I hope you have enough class and manners to allow me my privacy. Watch if you want to, but don&#x2019;t get in my face. If you&#x2019;re still here when I&#x2019;m done then we can take another swing at the &#x2018;why&#x2019; question and I&#x2019;ll decide whether I go with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this bullshit,&#x201d; snapped the Nose.</p><p>Andrews just looked at me. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the agenda, Andrews,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Take it or leave it.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite his orders and his professional cool he was a little off-balance. The very fact that he was hesitating meant that there was something hinky about thism, and my guess was that he didn&#x2019;t know what it was--so he wasn&#x2019;t ready to try and strongarm me. I was a federal agent tied to Homeland&#x2013;or close enough for his purposes&#x2014;and I held military rank on top of it. He couldn&#x2019;t be sure that a misstep here wouldn&#x2019;t do him some career harm. I watched his eyes as he sorted through his playbook.</p><p>&#x201c;Ten minutes,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I should have just nodded and went to visit Helen&#x2019;s grave, but the fact that they were accosting me here of all places really pissed me off. &#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; I said, stepping back but still smiling, &#x201c;when it gets to ten minutes start holding your breath.&#x201d;</p><p>I gave him a cheery wink and used the index finger of the hand holding the bottle to point at the Nose. Then I turned and headed through the tombstones, feeling the heat of their stares on my back like laser sites.</p></p><h2>The Book of Speculation: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>One of BuzzFeed's 24 Best Fiction Books of 2015</b><br><b></b><br><b>**Includes a bonus short story by Erika Swyler, "The Mermaid Girl"**</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>"As Simon, a lonely research librarian, searches frantically for the key to a curse that might be killing the women in his family, he learns strange and fascinating secrets about their past. A tale full of magic and family mystery, <i>The Book of Speculation</i> will keep you up all night reading."&#x2015;Isaac Fitzgerald, BuzzFeed </p><p>Simon Watson, a young librarian, lives alone in a house that is slowly crumbling toward the Long Island Sound. His parents are long dead. His mother, a circus mermaid who made her living by holding her breath, drowned in the very water his house overlooks. His younger sister, Enola, ran off six years ago and now reads tarot cards for a traveling carnival.</p><p>One June day, an old book arrives on Simon's doorstep, sent by an antiquarian bookseller who purchased it on speculation. Fragile and water damaged, the book is a log from the owner of a traveling carnival in the 1700s, who reports strange and magical things, including the drowning death of a circus mermaid. Since then, generations of "mermaids" in Simon's family have drowned--always on July 24, which is only weeks away.</p><p>As his friend Alice looks on with alarm, Simon becomes increasingly worried about his sister. Could there be a curse on Simon's family? What does it have to do with the book, and can he get to the heart of the mystery in time to save Enola? </p><p>In the tradition of Sara Gruen's <i>Water for Elephants, </i>Erin Morgenstern's <i>The Night Circus, </i>and Elizabeth Kostova's <i>The Historian, The Book of Speculation</i>--with two-color illustrations by the author--is Erika Swyler's moving debut novel about the power of books, family, and magic.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Water shrouds the fascinating, often doomed characters of <em>The Book of Speculation</em>. Featuring mermaids, swarms of horseshoe crabs, deadly floods, and the silent secrets of an ancient tarot deck, <em>The Book of Speculation</em> is split like a savory peach between the odd ventures of a traveling carnival in the late 1700s and the modern-day discovery by librarian Simon Watson of an old, handwritten volume containing his grandmother&#x2019;s name. The water-damaged book may reveal the root of certain mysteries in his family, such as why the women can hold their breath far, far longer than normal, and the inexplicable reason they have all drowned while young women on the exact same date&#x2014;a date that is only a few days away as the book begins. When Simon&#x2019;s sister, Enola, unexpectedly returns home, vibrating with an angry sadness Simon has never seen before, Simon dives deeper into the book and the dark waters of their family history, hoping to change what he fears is her destiny. Erika Swyler has written an engrossing literary tale-spinner with an assurance rarely mastered in debut novels, allowing a well-placed detail or a lyrical phrase to paint a character or sketch even as she builds tension like a pro.

Our first American outing was the Eighth Annual Northeastern Mycological Foray, to which we'd been invited by Dick Homola. For us, it was a culture shock. Things are very different across the water; in Britain, our annual mycological society foray is much more of an academic affair, with Latin rather than English serving as the official language. However, we soon changed gear and adapted to the lively and entertaining style of a weekend on an American campus, including Phoebe, who quickly learned to crawl in the woods along a county road near Bangor, Maine.</p> <p>The study of mushrooms in North America is both ahead and behind the European science of mycology. There are many excellent American monographs of genera, almost all of them co-authored by Alexander H. Smith, whose truly herculean volume of work demonstrates the enormous energy he invested in his lifetime's study. Indeed, there are a greater number of modern American monographs available than there are monographs of European genera. In Europe, on the other hand, there are three exceedingly good books that deal with the larger subject of the Agaric Flora in its entirety: <i>Flore Analytique des Champignons Sup�rieurs</i> by K�hner and Romagnesi; <i>Keys to Agarics and Boleti</i> by Meinhard Moser; and <i>The Check List of British and Irish Basidiomycota</i> by N.W. Legion and A. Henrici et al.</p> <p>After traveling all over North America and seeing firsthand the great diversity of its tree species and the sheer range of its climate and habitat, from swamps, forests and deserts to the high Rockies, I realized that the flora would prove to be far larger than that found in Europe. In his lifetime, Smith himself speculated that no more than two-thirds of North American species had been described. Despite the work of the many excellent mycologists in the post-Smith era, I suspect his statement is probably still true. This makes mycology in North America a most exciting subject; there is so much important and original work to be done in pushing forward the boundaries of science. To take just one group, the underground agarics that can be found in the dry western climate: in Europe, such things are almost unknown, yet in America, there are dozens of species, making it a most fascinating area of study. American mycologists are now also working on the underground flora of the Australian deserts.</p> <p>What is a mushroom?</p> <p>Fungi are a very large class of organisms and have a structure that can be compared to plants, but they lack chlorophyll and are thus unable to build the carbon compounds essential to life. Instead, in the same way that animals do, they draw their sustenance ready-made from living or dead plants, or even animals. A mushroom is the reproductive part (known as the fruit body) of the fungus organism, and it develops to form and distribute the spores.</p> <p>A fungus begins as minute, hair-like filaments called hyphae. The hyphae develop into a fine, cobweb-like net that spreads through the material from which the fungus obtains its nutrition. This net is known as the mycelium. Mycelium is extremely fine and in most cases cannot be seen without the use of a microscope. In other cases, the hyphae bind together to make a thicker mat (tomentum) that can readily be observed. To produce a fruiting body, two mycelia of the same species band together in the equivalent of a sexual stage. Then, if the conditions of nutrition, humidity, temperature and light are met, a fruit body will be formed.</p> <p><i>The larger fungi are divided into two distinct groups:</i> The spore droppers, Basidiomycetes (pp. 16- 359). In this group, the spores are developed on the outside of a series of specialized, club-shaped cells (basidia), which form on the gills, spines, tubes, or other spore-bearing surfaces. As they mature, they fall from the basidia and are normally distributed by wind. Most of the fungi in this book are of this kind, including the gilled agarics, the boletes, the polypores, and the jelly fungi.</p> <p>The spore shooters, Ascomycetes, (pp. 360- 379). The spores in this group are formed within flask-shaped sacs (asci). When the spores have matured, they are shot out through the tips of the asci. The morels, cup fungi, and truffles are in this group.</p> <p>How to use this book</p> <p>Mushrooms and fungi are a large and very diverse group of organisms, and although this book only deals with the larger forms, there is nevertheless a bewildering selection from which to choose. If you are just beginning to learn about mushrooms, leaf through these pages to get a general feel for the diversity of species that are illustrated. The next step in making an identification is to refer to the pictures for beginners (pp. 10-12). These will introduce you to the general features of the most common genera. The generic keys (p. 13) may be too difficult for a beginner.</p> <p>Positively identifying a collection of mushrooms is a very tricky business, even for an expert, and if you plan to eat some of the specimens you collect, you must be absolutely positive about your identification before doing so. With this book, you can check the illustrations against your samples, but no book will ever be able to give you the experience you need to be certain. If you want to learn about mushrooms, the only sensible strategy is to go out collecting with experts, listen to what they have to tell you, question them about everything that you can think of, and use a book to cross-check.</p></p><h2>Developing a Business Case (Pocket Mentor)</h2><p>How do you decide the best course of action for your company to take advantage of new opportunities?

For two decades, historian Alice Dreger has led a life of extraordinary engagement, combining activist service to victims of unethical medical research with defense of scientists whose work has outraged identity politics activists. With spirit and wit, Dreger offers in<i>&nbsp;Galileo&#x2019;s Middle Finger </i>an unforgettable vision of the importance of rigorous truth seeking in today&#x2019;s America, where both the free press and free scholarly inquiry struggle under dire economic and political threats.<br> &nbsp;<br> This illuminating chronicle begins with Dreger&#x2019;s own research into the treatment of people born intersex (once called hermaphrodites). Realization of the shocking surgical and ethical abuses conducted in the name of &#x201c;normalizing&#x201d; intersex children&#x2019;s gender identities moved Dreger to become an internationally recognized patient rights activist. But even as the intersex rights movement succeeded, Dreger began to realize how some fellow progressive activists were employing lies and personal attacks to silence scientists whose data revealed uncomfortable truths about humans. In researching one such case, Dreger suddenly became the target of just these kinds of attacks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Troubled, she decided to try to understand more&#x2014;to travel the country to ferret out the truth behind various controversies, to obtain a global view of the nature and costs of these battles.&nbsp;<i>Galileo&#x2019;s Middle Finger</i>&nbsp;describes Dreger&#x2019;s long and harrowing journeys between the two camps for which she felt equal empathy: social justice activists determined to win and researchers determined to put hard truths before comfort. Ultimately what emerges is a lesson about the intertwining of justice and of truth&#x2014;and a lesson of the importance of responsible scholars and journalists to our fragile democracy.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Galileo&#x2019;s Middle Finger</i>:</b><br> &#x201c;An engrossing volume that is sure to undo any lingering notions that academic debate is the province of empiricists who pledge allegiance to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth . . .

But first I have to tell you a little bit about how I got into this mess. And explain why I think we now have a very dangerous situation on our hands.</p><p>As an academic historian who typically hangs out with her own political kind, I&#x2019;m aware of the stereotype many liberals have about conservative Catholics. The former believe the latter don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;that conservative religious people don&#x2019;t care about facts and rigorous inquiry. But my conservative Catholic parents <i>were</i> thinkers. Twice as often as my parents told their four children to go wash, they told us to go look something up. At our suburban tract house on Long Island in the 1970s, our parents shelved the <i>Encyclop�dia Britannica</i> right next to the dinner table so we could easily reach for a volume to settle the frequent debates. The rotating stack of periodicals in our kitchen included not only religiously oriented newsletters, but also the<i> New York Times</i> and <i>National Geographic</i>. Our parents took us to science museums, woke us up for lunar eclipses, and pushed us to question our textbooks and even our teachers when they sounded wrong. Although our mother never mentioned that she had earned a degree in philosophy from Hunter College, she read to us aloud from Plato and Shakespeare, analyzing the texts as she read. Meanwhile, our father, a draftsman for one of the big Long Island defense contractors, loved learning in spite of having had only a high school education. We joked that he would someday be crushed under his books, most of them military histories of Poland, the homeland of both sides of our family. He got us microscopes and telescopes and talked seriously about the potential for alien life-forms. I vividly recall that, when one day we summoned him urgently to come see a giant UFO that had appeared in the sky, he was genuinely disappointed to discover he had bothered to grab his camera for the Goodyear blimp.</p><p>But besides being intellectuals and knowledge seekers, my parents were also industrial-strength Roman Catholics. They sought out Latin masses and avoided meat on Fridays long after Vatican II declared all that fuss unnecessary. They sent us to public school not only because the local public schools offered the best education around, but also because the local Catholic school struck them as dangerously liberal in its religious orientation. (Better to be among Protestants and Jews than roomfuls of squishy Catholics.) Their religious devotion manifested itself largely in pro-life activism. Even while their own children were still young and underfoot, my parents collected baby things to give to poor mothers, took in a young pregnant woman who had been thrown out by her parents, and became foster parents to a mixed-race baby of a single mother, ultimately adopting that child. As we were growing up, the basement of our house slowly filled with homemade placards we would carry when marching outside abortion clinics.</p><p>Although they were highly obedient to authority in their religious lives, in their political lives, my parents were rabble-rousers. My father ran for Congress on the Right-to-Life Party line, while my mother helped lead the local chapter of Feminists for Life. (In the 1970s, bra-burning pro-lifers were a real thing.) My mother especially embraced her American rights to speak, to assemble, to vote, and to protest, because she knew her life might well have turned out differently. Born in 1935 in Poland, she had somehow survived the Second World War with her extended family in their tiny farming village in an area subjected to repeated aerial bombings and ground-war skirmishes. Not long after the war ended, at the age of eleven, she had been suddenly transported with her brother and mother to America, where the three of them were reunited with her father. (Her father had had dual citizenship and had fought with the Americans.) On these shores, she found a land where you could, <i>without fear</i>, say and think what you wanted, worship and vote as you wanted, and openly object to what you found stupid or offensive. She let us know, as we were growing up, that she considered American democracy a true wonder, a tool to be used at every chance. The Bill of Rights seemed to her almost as sacred as the Bible. This view was implicitly and explicitly reinforced by the rare relatives who made it out of Soviet-controlled Poland and came to lodge with us.</p><p>My parents never seemed to feel a tension between these heavy strands that comprised their lives&#x2014;the Old World and the New, the religious and the intellectual, the obedient and the activist. I suppose that to them it all seemed obviously interrelated. They had no trouble sending me to confession one day and renewing my subscription to <i>Natural History</i> magazine the next. But as I grew up, I felt the tension one surely <i>must</i> feel when being simultaneously taught the importance of a specific dogma and the importance of freedom <i>from</i> dogma.</p><p>I knew that some people abandoned their parents&#x2019; religion as a way of asserting their independence. But for me, losing my religion wasn&#x2019;t about rebellion against my parents; indeed, I felt quite forlorn at the idea of disappointing my family by admitting my atheism. Still, my parents&#x2019; religious faith seemed to me incommensurate with our deeply felt faith in America&#x2014;a faith in freedom of inquiry, in freedom of thought, in the will and right of the people to collectively discover truth and to make their own rules accordingly. And I loved America much more than I loved the Vatican, that place where celibate old men had the right to tell intelligent women what we should think and do. By the time I was in my late teens, while my sister was on her way to becoming a nun, I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice that the place I felt the hope of salvation wasn&#x2019;t church. It was the American Museum of Natural History, that great cathedral of evolution. As often as I could, I would take the train into New York City and lie under the giant blue whale in the great darkened hall of ocean life. Every time I lay there&#x2014;waiting for the delicious moment when the whale started to move, from optical illusion&#x2014;science struck me as the obvious and perhaps only way to remain perpetually free from blinding, oppressive dogma.</p><p>I guess, then, it is not too surprising that I ultimately decided to pursue a PhD in the history and philosophy of science, at Indiana University. Exploring the very life and guts of science by studying the history and the philosophy of it&#x2014;<i>this</i> seemed to me the way to make sure that the most antidogmatic way of life we had available to us, the scientific way of life, would remain healthy and vigorous. But by the time I moved to Bloomington for graduate school, in 1990, not everyone in the academic fields of science studies (the history, philosophy, and sociology of science) felt the same devotion. At that point, Marxist and feminist science-studies scholars had for almost two decades been producing a large body of work deeply critical of various scientific claims and practices. They had shown how various scientists had, in word and deed, oppressed women, people of color, and poor folks, typically by making problematic &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; claims about them. Harvard biologist Ruth Hubbard, for example, had taken apart pseudoscientific claims that biology made women &#x201c;naturally&#x201d; less capable of doing science than men. Historians like Londa Schiebinger and Cynthia Eagle Russett had documented how, over many centuries, patriarchies had deployed the rhetoric of science to represent women as inherently inferior to men. Meanwhile, Hubbard&#x2019;s Harvard colleague Stephen Jay Gould had scrutinized &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; studies purporting to show important racial differences in skull size and IQ and had shown them to be hopelessly riddled with racist bias.</p><p>Make no mistake: As a liberal feminist, I <i>was</i> extremely sympathetic to feminist and Marxist science studies. Indeed, the work of scholars like Gould&#x2014;whose columns in <i>Natural History</i> I had devoured as a teenager&#x2014;struck me as constituting perhaps the most important work of social justice of our time, because it challenged racist and sexist claims about human nature. These leftist criticisms were part of what drove me to graduate school. But to me at least, the finding by Gould and others that scientists often suffered from bias didn&#x2019;t mean science <i>itself</i> was rotten. The very fact that scholars could <i>see and show</i> problems of racist and sexist bias in science stood to me as proof that, together, evidence-driven scholars could advance knowledge and ultimately get past the individual human mind&#x2019;s tendency to follow familiar scripts. If some of the products of science disappointed me, the process most assuredly did not. Indeed, in graduate school, I gravitated toward historical work specifically because I loved the relatively scientific process in history of seeking, organizing, and analyzing evidence&#x2014;of letting the data guide you toward new and unexpected learning, as much as humanly possible.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>IN GRADUATE SCHOOL, I ended up cutting my scholarly teeth on the history of the biomedical treatment of people born with sex anomalies&#x2014;the people who used to be called hermaphrodites. For many years, people would assume I had a personal stake in this identity issue&#x2014;that I or someone I loved had been born hermaphroditic&#x2014;but in fact this topic was simply suggested to me by my dissertation director, who saw it as a great way to examine &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; conceptions of gender, something that fascinated me as a feminist. To be honest, in looking into the history of hermaphroditism, I decided to focus on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries because I figured I&#x2019;d find easy pickings there. I already knew that most doctors of that time were politically conservative men, inclined to believe that the unequal social treatment of women arose from&#x2014;nay, was <i>required</i> by&#x2014;the allegedly natural two-sex divide. I knew there would have been a lot at stake for one of these sexist doctors when a patient appeared on inspection to be a hermaphrodite. Some of these patients had immediately apparent mixes of male and female traits&#x2014;a notable phallus and a vaginal opening or feminine breasts along with a full beard. Others appeared to have one sex externally but the opposite internally. All unwittingly challenged the idea that there were only two real sexes&#x2014;that there was a clear, natural divide between men and women.</p><p>Just as I was finishing my PhD, in 1995, I published my first scholarly paper, in the journal <i>Victorian Studies</i>. This article mapped out a hitherto uncharted history: what Victorian British doctors had done when faced with living proof that humans don&#x2019;t come in only two sexes.Though my report contained some grainy 1890s photographs of ambiguous genitalia, it was still pretty academic, showing no real hint of the odd path the paper&#x2019;s publication would lead me down. My finding was simply that Victorian doctors, befuddled by cases of &#x201c;doubtful sex,&#x201d; had deployed pragmatic combinations of clever rhetorical strategies, new scientific tools like microscopes, and the occasional surgical scalpel to try to make &#x201c;true hermaphroditism&#x201d; virtually disappear, all to protect long-standing social distinctions between men and women. But dry as that article may have been, it ended up pushing me into two unfamiliar and intense worlds: contemporary sex politics and contemporary medical activism. That&#x2019;s because, thanks to the Internet, by the time I came to this topic, in the mid-1990s, something was going on that the Victorian doctors would never have imagined: People who had been born with various sex anomalies had started to find each other, and they had started to organize as an identity rights movement.</p><p>Labeling themselves <i>intersex,</i> many gathered under the leadership of Bo Laurent, the founder of the Intersex Society of North America, and after reading my <i>Victorian Studies</i> article, some of these intersex activists, including Bo, contacted me. A couple wrote me simply to complain that they found some of my language offensive, apparently not realizing I was relaying Victorian rhetoric in my article. By contrast, Bo got my work. And she asked for my help in changing the way children born intersex were treated in modern medicine.</p><p>Now, as a straight, sex-typical female earning degrees in history and philosophy, I had started working in this field not only rather uneducated about human sex anatomy, but also rather uneducated about the politics of contemporary medicine. Still, it didn&#x2019;t take long for me to see the ways that our present-day medical system was indeed as broken as Bo and her compatriots were describing. Indeed, the system being employed at the children&#x2019;s hospital down the street from my grad-school apartment made the Victorian approach look relatively benign. The modern system featured not only highly aggressive cosmetic genital surgeries in infancy for children born with &#x201c;socially inappropriate&#x201d; genital variations like big clitorises, but also the withholding of diagnoses from patients and parents out of fear that they couldn&#x2019;t handle the truth. It treated boys born with small penises as hopeless cases who &#x201c;had&#x201d; to be castrated and sex-changed into girls, and it assumed that the ultimate ability of girls to reproduce as mothers should take precedence over all else, including the ability to someday experience orgasm.</p><p>I hastened to tell Bo, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a historian; I study <i>dead</i> people.&#x201d; However, once I understood what was really going on at pediatric hospitals all over the nation&#x2014;once I understood that Bo&#x2019;s clitoris had been amputated in the name of sex &#x201c;normalcy&#x201d; and that this practice was still going on&#x2014;I felt I had to assist in her efforts. I had been raised to be an activist and to be someone who helps people in desperate circumstances, and I was stunned and outraged by what was going on. I threw myself into the struggle and spent the decade after grad school living two lives&#x2014;as a professor researching and writing academic histories of the medical establishment&#x2019;s treatment of intersex and also as a patient advocate and a leading activist for the rights of sexual minorities. By day, I was your typical history professor&#x2014;researching, teaching, and dealing with committee assignments. By night, I was campaigning to stop unnecessary and harmful genital surgeries, ill-advised sex changes on babies, and the well-meaning lies told to affected families. I held fund-raisers, I drafted press releases, I developed policies, I wrote and ghost-wrote propaganda, and I stuffed a lot of envelopes. I also testified to governmental committees, met with groups of activists and doctors, got media training, and appeared as a talking head on one news program after another.</p><p>I found the advocacy work so meaningful and so exhausting that when it was time for me to go up for promotion to full professorship, I quit my day job instead. About ten years into my life as a PhD, I gave up tenure and the ability to grow my retirement accou...</p></p><h2>The Storyteller: A Novel, Cover may vary</h2><p><p>At a small gallery in Florence, a Peruvian writer happens upon a photograph of a tribal storyteller deep in the jungles of the Amazon. He is overcome with the eerie sense that he knows this man...that the storyteller is not an Indian at all but an old school friend, Saul Zuratas. As recollections of Zuratas flow through his mind, the writer begins to imagine Zuratas's transformation from a modern to a central member of the unacculturated Machiguenga tribe. Weaving the mysteries of identity, storytelling, and truth, Vargas Llosa has created a spellbinding tale of one man's journey from the modern world to our origins, abandoning one in order to find meaning in both.</p></p><p><p><b>MARIO VARGAS LLOSA</b> was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010 "for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat." Peru's foremost writer, he has been awarded the Cervantes Prize, the Spanish-speaking world's most distinguished literary honor, and the Jerusalem Prize. His many works include <i>The Feast of the Goat, The Bad Girl, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The War of the End of the World</i>, and <i>The Storyteller</i>. He lives in London.</p>THE STORYTELLER (Chapter One) <p>I came to Firenze to forget Peru and the Peruvians for a while, and suddenly my unfortunate country forced itself upon me this morning in the most unexpected way. I had visited Dante&#x2019;s restored house, the little Church of San Martino del V�scovo, and the lane where, so legend has it, he first saw Beatrice, when, in the little Via Santa Margherita, a window display stopped me short: bows, arrows, a carved oar, a pot with a geometric design, a mannequin bundled into a wild cotton cushma. But it was three or four photographs that suddenly brought back to me the flavor of the Peruvian jungle. The wide rivers, the enormous trees, the fragile canoes, the frail huts raised up on pilings, and the knots of men and women, naked to the waist and daubed with paint, looking at me unblinkingly from the glossy prints.</p><p>Naturally, I went in. With a strange shiver and the presentiment that I was doing something foolish, that mere curiosity was going to jeopardize in some way my well-conceived and, up until then, well-executed plan&#x2014;to read Dante and Machiavelli and look at Renaissance paintings for a couple of months in absolute solitude&#x2014;and precipitate one of those personal upheavals that periodically make chaos of my life. But, naturally, I went in.</p><p>The gallery was minute. A single low-ceilinged room in which, to make room for all the photographs, two panels had been added, every inch of them covered with pictures. A thin girl in glasses, sitting behind a small table, looked up at me. Could I visit the &#x201c;Natives of the Amazon Forest&#x201d; exhibition?</p><p>&#x201c;Certo. Avanti, avanti.&#x201d;</p><p>There were no artifacts inside the gallery, only photos, fifty at least, most of them fairly large. There were no captions, but someone, perhaps the photographer himself, one Gabriele Malfatti, had written a few pages indicating that the photos had been taken during a two-week journey in the Amazon region of the departments of Cusco and Madre de Dios in eastern Peru. The artist&#x2019;s intention had been to describe, &#x201c;without demagoguery or aestheticism,&#x201d; the daily life of a tribe which, until a few years ago, had lived virtually isolated from civilization, scattered about in units of one or two families. Only in our day had they begun to group together in those places documented by the exhibition, but many of them still remained in the forest. The name of the tribe was Hispanicized without spelling errors: the Machiguengas.</p><p>The photos were a quite faithful reflection of Malfatti&#x2019;s intention. There were the Machiguengas, aiming a harpoon from the bank of a river, or, half concealed in the undergrowth, drawing a bow in pursuit of capybaras or peccaries; there they were, gathering cassava in the tiny plots scattered around their brand-new villages, perhaps the first in their long history, clearing the forest with machetes, weaving palm leaves to roof their huts. A group of women sat lacing mats and baskets; another was making headdresses, hooking brightly colored parrot and macaw feathers into wooden circlets. There they were, decorating their faces and bodies in intricate designs with dye from the annatto tree, lighting fires, drying hides and skins, fermenting cassava for masato beer in canoe-shaped receptacles. The photos eloquently showed how few of them there were in the immensity of sky, water, and vegetation that surrounded them, how fragile and frugal their life was; their isolation, their archaic ways, their helplessness. It was true: neither demagoguery nor aestheticism.</p><p>What I am about to say is not an invention after the fact, nor yet a false memory. I am quite sure I moved from one photograph to the next with an emotion that at a certain moment turned to anxiety. What&#x2019;s happening to you? What might you come across in these pictures that would justify such anxiety?</p><p>From the very first photos I had recognized the clearings where Nueva Luz and Nuevo Mundo had been built&#x2014;I had been in both less than three years before&#x2014;and an overall view of the second of these had immediately brought back to my mind the feeling of impending catastrophe with which I lived through the acrobatic landing that morning as the Cessna belonging to the Institute of Linguistics avoided Machiguenga children. I even seemed to recognize some of the faces of the men and women with whom I had spoken, with Mr. Schneil&#x2019;s help. This became certainty when, in another photograph, I saw, with the same little bloated belly and the same bright eyes my memory had preserved, the boy whose mouth and nose had been eaten away by uta ulcers. He revealed to the camera, with the same innocence and unselfconsciousness with which he had shown it to us, that hole with teeth, palate, and tonsils which gave him the appearance of some mysterious wild beast.</p><p>The photograph I was hoping to see from the moment I entered the gallery was among the last. From the very first glance it was evident that the gathering of men and women, sitting in a circle in the Amazonian way&#x2014;similar to the Oriental: legs crossed tailor-fashion, back held very straight&#x2014;and bathed in the light of dusk fading to dark, was hypnotically attentive. They were absolutely still. All the faces were turned, like radii of a circumference, toward the central point: the silhouette of a man at the heart of that circle of Machiguengas drawn to him as to a magnet, standing there speaking and gesticulating. I felt a cold shiver down my spine. I thought: &#x201c;How did that Malfatti get them to allow him to...How did he manage to...?&#x201d; I stooped, brought my face up very close to the photograph. I kept looking at it, smelling it, piercing it with my eyes and imagination, until I noticed that the girl in charge of the gallery had risen from her table and was coming toward me in alarm.</p><p>Making an effort to contain my excitement, I asked if the photographs were for sale. No, she didn&#x2019;t think so. They belonged to Rizzoli, the publishers. Apparently they were going to appear in a book. I asked her to put me in touch with the photographer. No, that wouldn&#x2019;t be possible, unfortunately: &#x201c;Il signore Gabriele Malfatti � morto.&#x201d;</p><p>Dead? Yes. Of a fever. A virus he&#x2019;d caught in the jungle, forse. Poor man! He was a fashion photographer: he&#x2019;d worked for Vogue and Uomo, that sort of magazine, photographing models, furniture, jewelry, clothes. He&#x2019;d spent his life dreaming of doing something different, more personal, such as taking this trip to the Amazon. And when at last he was able to do so, and they were just about to publish a book with his work, he died! And now, le dispiaceva, but it was l&#x2019;ora di pranzo and she had to close.</p><p>I thanked her. Before leaving to confront once again the wonders and the hordes of tourists of Firenze, I managed to cast one last glance at the photograph. Yes. No doubt whatsoever about it.

Miller has written what critics are calling one of the most powerful accounts of warfare ever published.<br><br>Here are the horror and heroism of World War II in the words of the men who fought it, the journalists who covered it, and the civilians who were caught in its fury. Miller gives us an up-close, deeply personal view of a war that was more savagely fought&#x2014;and whose outcome was in greater doubt&#x2014;than readers might imagine. This is the war that Americans at the home front would have read about had they had access to the previously censored testimony of the soldiers on which Miller builds his gripping narrative.<br> <br>Miller covers the entire war&#x2014;on land, at sea, and in the air&#x2014;and provides new coverage of the brutal island fighting in the Pacific, the bomber war over Europe, the liberation of the death camps, and the contributions of African Americans and other minorities. He concludes with a suspenseful, never-before-told story of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, based on interviews with the men who flew the mission that ended the war.</p><p>In 1945, the noted historian Henry Steele Commager, then employed by the U.S. Office of War Information, published <i>The Story of World War II,</i> a comprehensive survey of a struggle still terribly fresh. Donald Miller, himself an accomplished historian, amplifies Commager's work with this substantially revised edition.<p> Drawing on oral histories and on the vast body of literature that followed the original edition, Miller writes vividly of the key events that shaped the progress of the war, from Dunkirk to the surrender of the Japanese government aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. Along the way, he examines the war as it played out on many fronts, incorporating the memories of women defense workers, German and Japanese combat veterans, and the ordinary Allied soldiers whom correspondent Ernie Pyle called "doggies." The text is thoroughly illustrated with period photographs, maps, and sidebars, adding both to its immediacy and its usefulness as a reference work.</p><p> Concentrating on the war through American eyes, Miller and Commager's book is far from definitive.

Yet the lineup of contributors to this volume makes this, in my view, the most impressive defense of definite atonement in over a century. Beyond rehearsing traditional arguments, first-rate historical, biblical, and systematic theologians bring fresh angles and exegesis to bear. <em>From Heaven He Came and Sought Her</em> is a gift that will no doubt keep on giving for generations to come.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Horton,</strong> J.

It shows convincingly, through multi-authored contributions, (1) that the issues of the extent of the atonement and its nature cannot be separated&#x2015;penal substitution, at the heart of why Christ had to die, stands or falls with definite atonement; and (2) how definite atonement alone provides for a gospel offer of salvation from sin that is genuinely free. In engaging various opposing views on this much-disputed topic, the editors seek to do so in a constructive and irenic spirit, an effort in which they and the other authors have succeeded admirably.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Richard B.

Those familiar with the terrain will recognize that the editors know exactly the key issues and figures in this debate. And none of the authors who follow disappoint. The tone is calm and courteous, the scholarship rigorous and relentless, the argument clear and compelling. This penetrating discussion takes into account the major modern academic criticisms of definite atonement (Barth, the Torrances, Armstrong, Kendall, and others) as well as more popular critiques (Clifford, Driscoll and Breshears). An impressive team of scholars adorns this subject and aims to help Christians toward a deeper gratitude to God for his grace, a greater assurance of salvation, a sweeter fellowship with Christ, stronger affections in their worship of him, more love for people and superior courage and sacrifice in witness and service, and indeed to propel us into the global work of missions with compassion and confidence.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ligon Duncan,</strong> Chancellor, CEO, and John E.

From Heaven He Came and Sought Her offers the fullest and most nuanced treatment on definite atonement I know, and will richly add to the substance and quality of future conversations about the intent of the atonement.

(a study guide based on the book)</h2><p>DON'T WASTE YOUR PAIN. None of us escapes the heartache and disappointments of life. To live is to hurt, and we all have the wounds to prove it. Regardless of how we've been hurt, we all face a common question: What should we do with our pain? Should we stoically ignore it? Should we just "get over it?" Should we let it "make us stronger?" Should we optimistically hope that everything will work out in the end? If we fail to respond appropriately to the wounds that life and relationships inflict, our pain will be wasted; it will numb us or destroy us. But suffering doesn't have to mangle our hearts and rob us of the joy of life. It can, instead, lead us to life-if we know the path to healing. <br>Healing is not the resolution of our past; it is the use of our past to draw us into deeper relationship with God and his purposes for our lives. We don't have to be held captive by the hurts of our past. We can move from feelings of powerlessness, betrayal, and ambivalence into faith, hope and love. The Healing Path takes us beyond self-discovery to God-discovery, giving us the tools to excavate the riches that lay beneath the surface of our pain. If you're ready to use the experiences of the past and present to shape a future characterized by love, service, and joy, now is the time to step out onto The Healing Path.</p><p>DAN B.

The waiting allowed time to savor the prospect of revenge.</p><p>It was rather pleasant sitting there, propped against a mossy tree, rifle at the ready. High summer in the Cascades was a very enjoyable time of year. True, the tourists clogged the narrow mountain roads and insisted on stopping at every lookout point to take photographs. They left their trash behind at the numerous picnic sites. But come fall they would be driven away by the heavy rains and high winds of the early storms. In winter snow would make the roads treacherous.</p><p>In the meantime the warm, gentle breeze stirring the branches carried the scents of the trees and the vegetation that thrived in the short growing season.</p><p>Now there was time to contemplate the past and all the injustices that could be laid at the feet of the man inside the cabin. While making preparations the killer had worried that when the moment finally arrived, there would be at least a few qualms. Instead there was only a great sense of certainty.</p><p>The door of the cabin opened. Gordon Greenslade came out onto the porch. He had always been a good-looking man and he was aging well. His hair had turned an attractive silver-white, not dull gray. He was still lean and fit and his aquiline features had softened only a little.</p><p>He had a mug of coffee in his hand. The killer recognized the mug. It was several years old, handmade and hand-painted. Like everything else in the rustic interior of the cabin, it was worn and faded.</p><p>These days Greenslade used the cabin primarily for hunting and fishing and when he just wanted to get away from the pressures that came with being the town&#x2019;s leading citizen. He owned the company that was the second-largest employer in town&#x2014;the college had taken first place in recent years. But more to the point, he owned the local politicians, the authorities of Loring College and a couple of state representatives. If the rumors were true, he also had at least one U.S. senator in his pocket.</p><p>Everybody in Loring respected Gordon Greenslade and a lot of people owed him in one way or another. He was a rigid, self-righteous pillar of the community. But no one really liked him. It would be entertaining to see how much effort the police put into investigating his death.</p><p>The killer rose and picked up the rifle. There was a clear line of sight. It would be easy to take the kill shot without being seen. But that would defeat the purpose. When you set out to walk the path of revenge you wanted your target to know who was pulling the trigger.</p><p>The killer moved out into the clearing in front of the cabin. It took Gordon a moment to notice that he had company. When he did, he was startled, but only briefly. Irritation soon replaced the surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>The killer did not bother to respond. It was, after all, pretty damn obvious what was about to go down.</p><p>Belatedly Greenslade realized the rifle was aimed at him. Rage and panic flashed across his face.</p><p>He tried to retreat back into the cabin where he no doubt had a gun. But he didn&#x2019;t move fast enough. The bullet took him in the chest.</p><p>A head shot would have been too easy because death would have been instantaneous. This way there would be time for the killer to watch the target bleed out; time for Greenslade to comprehend that this was all about revenge.</p><p>The death of Gordon Greenslade was front-page news in the Loring Herald. There was genuine shock&#x2014;Greenslade had, after all, been the biggest mover and shaker in town&#x2014;but not a lot of genuine mourning. Still, everyone made a point of displaying the appropriate degree of respect for the deceased, because Gordon Greenslade&#x2019;s death had not changed the economic and political reality. The Greenslade family still controlled the second-largest employer in Loring and, indirectly, Loring&#x2019;s largest employer, the college. It existed solely because of the Greenslade endowment.</p><p>The police did their job and conducted an investigation. But in the end they came to the conclusion that the killer had anticipated: Gordon Greenslade had been killed in an accident. The shooter had been hunting out of season and probably hadn&#x2019;t even been aware that his wild shot had killed a man. In any event, it was unlikely that the person who had pulled the trigger would ever be found.</p><p>Everyone who lived in the area knew that the mountains were inherently dangerous. In the fall, heavy rains flooded the rivers to dangerous levels, sweeping away those who were unlucky enough to get caught in the rushing waters. Landslides blocked roads. Strong winds felled trees that could crush vehicles. In the winter, backcountry avalanches invariably took the lives of a few skiers and snowboarders every year. In the summer, it was inevitable that a hiker or two or three would fall into a crevasse or simply go missing forever.</p><p>And hunting accidents happened all the time in the mountains.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Forces of Matter (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p>These lectures by a famous inventor offer an easy-to-understand introduction to the interactions of the universe's physical forces.

When the Prime Minister of England William Gladstone asked Faraday what the usefulness of electricity would be, Faraday famously replied, "Why, Sir, there is every possibility that you will soon be able to tax it!" In addition to being a great experimenter, Faraday had the gift of exposition for a popular audience, as seen in the books which Dover has reprinted, <i>The Forces of Matter</i> (2010), <i>Experimental Researches in Electricity</i> (2004), and perhaps his most famous single book for the general reader, <i>The Chemical History of a Candle</i> (2003). </p><p></p><p>It is reliably reported that Einstein had a photograph of Faraday on the wall of his study alongside portraits of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"The world little knows how many of the thoughts and theories which have passed through the mind of a scientific investigator have been crushed in silence and secrecy by his own severe criticism and adverse examination: that in the most successful instances not a tenth of the suggestions, the hopes, the wishes, the preliminary conclusions have been realized." &#x2014; Michael Faraday </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Advice To A Young Scientist (Alfred P.

Adorno gave a lecture which is not merely of historical interest.&nbsp;<br><br>Against the background of the rise of the National Democratic Party of Germany, which had enjoyed remarkable electoral success in the first two years after its formation in November 1964, Adorno analysed the goals, resources and tactics of the new right-wing nationalism of this time. Contrasting it with the &#x2018;old&#x2019; fascism of the Nazis, Adorno gave particular attention to the ways in which far-right movements elicited enthusiastic support in sections of the West German population, 20 years after the war had ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Much has changed since then, but some elements have remained the same or resurfaced in new forms, 50 years later. Adorno&#x2019;s penetrating analysis of the sources of right-wing radicalism is as relevant today as it was five decades ago. It is a prescient message to future generations who find themselves embroiled once again in a struggle against a resurgent nationalism and right-wing extremism.</p><p><b>Theodor W. Adorno</b>&nbsp;(1903-1969), a prominent member of the Frankfurt School, was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century in the areas of social theory, philosophy and aesthetics.</p><h2>The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology</h2><p><p><b>The most up-to-date, comprehensive resource on silviculture that covers the range of topics and issues facing today&#x2019;s foresters and resource professionals</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The tenth edition of the classic work, <i>The Practice of Silviculture: Applied Forest Ecology,</i> includes the most current information and the results of research on the many issues that are relevant to forests and forestry.

Anne Enright has brought together a dazzling collection of Irish stories by authors born in the twentieth century - from Mary Lavin and Frank O'Connor to Claire Keegan and Kevin Barry. With a pithy and passionate introduction by Enright, The Granta Book of the Irish Short Story traces this great tradition through decades of social change and shows the pleasure Irish writers continue to take in the short-story form. Deft and often devastating, the short story dodges the rolling mythologies of of Irish life to produce truths that are delightful and real. <br><br>Also includes stories by: Maeve Brennan, Roddy Doyle, Mary Lavin, Colum McCann, William Trevor, John McGahern, Colm T�ib�n, Claire Keegan and Kevin Barry.</p><p>ANNE ENRIGHT has published essays, short stories, a non-fiction book about motherhood and five novels including The Gathering, winner of the 2007 Man Booker Prize. She lives in Dublin.<p>Enright has assembled a collection notable for its emotional range, its openness to many voices (not all lonely) and its willingness to reflect current realities. There is no conclusive formula linking such disparate narratives, no slick exploitation of Irishness, but rather a rich interplay of themes that capture a world in transition. Declan Kiberd, Irish Times</p> <p>A rich and absorbing volume, an evocation of life in Ireland which, at its finest, produces brilliantly skewering fragments written to pierce as well as gleam ... Enright's choice is a shrewd one, succeeding in typifying each writer whilst expressing their uniqueness. Tom Adair, Scotland on Sunday</p> <p>A book that intoxicates you with the sheer scope and potency of the short story form. Daragh Reddin, Metro</p> <p>The Granta Book of the Irish Short Story is more cherishable than canonical, and refreshingly contemporary in its selection of writers and writerly concerns. Keith Hopper, Times Literary Supplement</p> <p>[Anne Enright's] witty, brilliant introduction is one of the jewels in this selection ... When making her choices she concentrated on the art rather than the Irishness, and the result is sometimes wonderfully unexpected - here are William Trevor, Colm Toibin, Roddy Doyle, Clare Boylan and all the other geniuses, but not as you think you know them. Unmissable. Kate Saunders, The Times</p> <p>In an elegant and considered introduction to this collection, [Enright] explains that these short stories are simply ones she enjoys. However, the 31 inclusions cannot but say something about Ireland ... 'A Priest in the Family' by Colm Toibin is superb ... Edna O'Brien offers another fresh take on the sexuality of the clergy ... The further positives of The Grnta Book of the Irish Short Story are too many to mention ... In this collection you encounter loners, outsiders and deeper versions of people you know; and eventually, one will say something just to you, and the mystery of the Irish short story comes as close as it can to being understood. Eithne Shortall, Sunday Times Ireland</p> <p>We may not be very good at economics or honest politics, but we certainly know how to write a short story. The excellent Granta Book of the Irish Short Story, edited by Anne Enright, is a must-read. Irish Times</p> <p>Full of tales that combine lyricism, humour and tragedy by the likes of William Trevor as well as relative newcomers such as Claire Keegan and Philip Ceallaigh, it is shot through with an enduring sense of place but at the same time marks the enormous social changes Ireland has undergone in the past century. Giles Foden, Conde Nast Traveller</p> <p>This collection makes a bewitching bedside companion, amply illustrating that the Irish short story is very much alive and kicking.

I still could not find anything wrong. Alex rolled over on the table. Even with the new mustache he still looked like the surfer boy he&#x2019;d been.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I rested my hand on his shoulder. &#x201c;Nothing as far as I can see. You&#x2019;re not too tight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I must be. Richard&#x2019;s not that big. I did everything you said and I still can&#x2019;t take him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re tensing up,&#x201d; I said. He tried to argue, but I stopped him. &#x201c;Not willfully. It&#x2019;s beyond your control. Maybe anal sex isn&#x2019;t for you. There are plenty of other ways to satisfy Richard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked away. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand. This is important. If I don&#x2019;t do this&nbsp;...&#x201d; His voice trailed off. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you put me to sleep or something? Make it wider?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s wide enough.&#x201d; I gently directed him to look at me. &#x201c;There is nothing wrong down there. What else is bothering you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He didn&#x2019;t answer for several minutes, but I waited. Some things can&#x2019;t be rushed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether we call it anal sex, anal intercourse, or just plain fucking, this type of sex is an integral part of sexual relations for many men who have sex with men. But the practice is in no way limited to gay men; many women enjoy it too. In a recent survey of 100,000 women, Redbook Magazine found that 42 percent of women had tried it once, and, for 2 percent, anal sex was an important part of their sexual relationships. We are not alone! Many men enjoy anal sex; the experience is pleasurable and vital to their sex life.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember standing in horror as a physician I worked with berated a gay man he treated with a terse &#x201c;Your asshole is for shitting, not fucking!&#x201d; Well, this is not the case. Anal sex can be both pleasurable and safe if practiced properly. Unfortunately, homophobia has clouded the issue. Ignorance and rumor often magnify our fears about possible injury. Many gay men refuse to discuss anal sex with their physicians, and most physicians know little if anything about it&#x2014;other than that it transmits HIV.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many women view vaginal intercourse as the major step in their sexual evolution, giving considerable thought to who will be their first. Men joke about losing their virginity after their first anal sex experience and minimize its significance. True, we don&#x2019;t have a hymen to rupture, but anal sex is not an insignificant step, emotionally or physically. Many men view anal sex as the final step on their path to gayness. (Once you&#x2019;ve done it you must be gay.) For some it&#x2019;s a sign of their first true love. Others view anal sex as an assault on their masculinity. Unfortunately, some men recall their first episode of anal sex as the horror of sexual abuse, and they may never recover. In any case, you shouldn&#x2019;t bend over for anyone until you&#x2019;re ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> Physiologically, anal sex must not be taken lightly. Sure, you can&#x2019;t get pregnant, but there are a million other things you can get instead. Anal sex is probably the highest-risk sexual act performed by men who have sex with men&#x2014;and not just because of HIV. Most sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) pass between partners during anal sex&#x2014;even without ejaculation. And a condom may not be protection enough. In this era of sexual freedom, it is almost impossible to have a healthy sex life and avoid an STD. Before you let that guy inside you, make sure he&#x2019;s clean and you&#x2019;re protected.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you have anal sex regularly, use these pages as a guide; they may protect you from injury and STDs. And for those of you who aren&#x2019;t ready for anal sex, read on. Someday a relationship might arise when it becomes something that you both desire.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anatomy<br> &nbsp;<br> Anal intercourse differs from vaginal intercourse in several significant ways. First and foremost, a hole is not just a hole, and a woman&#x2019;s vagina is anatomically very different from your anus. The colon&#x2019;s purpose, as we all know, is to transport digestive waste from your small intestine to your anal opening where it&#x2019;s excreted. As part of this task, the colon&#x2019;s lining, or mucosa, is specially equipped to absorb water from the liquid waste of your small intestines and turn it into solid feces. When your colonic mucosa doesn&#x2019;t work properly, diarrhea results. Your colon&#x2019;s heightened absorption capability makes it a particularly susceptible entryway for many infections; HIV, of course, is one of the most deadly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your colon is approximately six feet long, and unless your partner is something of a &#x201c;giant&#x201d; among men, anal intercourse affects only the last few inches. This area includes your anus and rectum; although they both are regions of your colon, they are, in actuality, two very distinct anatomic sites. Your anus is lined by squamous cells, which are closely related to skin. Your rectum resembles the rest of your colon. Importantly, your anus has nerve endings capable of experiencing pain while your rectum does not.<br> &nbsp;<br> The muscles that control bowel movements, or sphincters, as they are commonly called, are concentrated in your anus and lower rectum. These muscles can be divided into an external sphincter and internal sphincter. (See Figure 1.1.) Your external sphincter, the outermost band of muscle, is under your direct control. You can willfully tighten it to keep gas or feces from leaking out, and you can relax it for defecation. Your internal sphincter muscle abuts your colon wall. It is an involuntary muscle, and as such you cannot willfully cause it to relax or contract. When feces enter your lower rectum, the internal sphincter involuntarily relaxes for defecation. If you&#x2019;re miles from a bathroom or in the middle of some speech, you depend on your external sphincter to contract and prevent an embarrassing situation from occurring. The rectal wall also contains nerve fibers that tell you the difference between feces and gas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as your internal sphincter muscle involuntarily relaxes when feces enter your rectum, it involuntarily contracts when a penis or other object attempts to enter from the outside. As the word &#x201c;involuntarily&#x201d; implies, this sphincter contraction is beyond your ability to control, no matter how relaxed or sexually aroused you are. The relaxation and contraction of the internal sphincter allows you to pass large bowel movements painlessly, yet a penis of equal or smaller size can hurt during insertion. An anal tear can occur during the initial phase of anal sex precisely because your partner pushes his penis through your closed sphincter. Think of his penis as a battering ram, one for which your internal sphincter is no match.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Emerald Green (The Ruby Red Trilogy, 3)</h2><p><p>Gwen has a destiny to fulfill, but no one will tell her what it is.<br> She's only recently learned that she is the Ruby, the final member of the time-traveling Circle of Twelve, and since then nothing has been going right.

And she's just learned that her charming time-traveling partner, Gideon, has probably been using her all along.<br> <i>Emerald Green </i>is the stunning conclusion to Kerstin Gier's Ruby Red Trilogy, picking up where <i>Sapphire Blue</i> left off, reaching new heights of intrigue and romance as Gwen finally uncovers the secrets of the time-traveling society and learns her fate.</p></p><p><p><b>Kerstin Gier</b> is the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of the Ruby Red trilogy, which has been translated into twenty-five languages, as well as several popular novels for adults. She lives in Germany.</p>ONE <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>THE END OF THE SWORD was pointing straight at my heart, and my murderer&#x2019;s eyes were like black holes threatening to swallow up everything that came too close to them. I knew I couldn&#x2019;t get away. With difficulty, I stumbled a few steps back. <br>The man followed me. &#x201c;I will wipe that which is displeasing to God off the face of the earth!&#x201d; he boomed. &#x201c;The ground will soak up your blood!&#x201d; <br>I had at least two smart retorts to these sinister words on the tip of my tongue. (Soak up my blood? Oh, come off it, this is a tiled floor.) But I was in such a panic that I couldn&#x2019;t get a word out. The man didn&#x2019;t look as if he&#x2019;d appreciate my little joke at this moment anyway. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t look as if he had a sense of humor at all. <br>I took another step back and came up against a wall. The killer laughed out loud. Okay, so maybe he did have a sense of humor, but it wasn&#x2019;t much like mine. <br>&#x201c;Die, demon!&#x201d; he cried, plunging his sword into my breast without any more ado. <br>I woke up, screaming. I was wet with sweat, and my heart hurt as if a blade really had pierced it. What a horrible dream! But was that really surprising? <br>My experiences of yesterday (and the day before) weren&#x2019;t exactly likely to make me nestle down comfortably in bed and sleep the sleep of the just. Unwanted thoughts were writhing around in my mind like flesh-eating plants gone crazy. <i>Gideon was only pretending</i>, I thought <i>. He doesn&#x2019;t really love me.</i> <br>&#x201c;He hardly has to do anything to attract girls,&#x201d; I heard Count Saint-Germain saying in his soft, deep voice, again and again. And &#x201c;Nothing is easier to calculate than the reactions of a woman in love.&#x201d; <br>Oh, yes? So how does a woman in love react when she finds out that someone&#x2019;s been lying to her and manipulating her? She spends hours on the phone to her best friend, that&#x2019;s how, then she sits about in the dark, unable to get to sleep, asking herself why the hell she ever fell for the guy in the first place, crying her eyes out at the same time because she wants him so much&nbsp;&#x2026; Right, so it doesn&#x2019;t take a genius to calculate that. <br>The lighted numbers on the alarm clock beside my bed said 3:10, so I must have nodded off after all. I&#x2019;d even slept for more than two hours. And someone&#x2014;my mum?&#x2014;must have come in to cover me up, because all I could remember was huddling on the bed with my arms around my knees, listening to my heart beating much too fast. <br>Odd that a broken heart can beat at all, come to think of it. <br>&#x201c;It feels like it&#x2019;s made of red splinters with sharp edges, and they&#x2019;re slicing me up from inside so that I&#x2019;ll bleed to death,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, trying to describe the state of my heart to Lesley (okay, so it sounds at least as corny as the stuff the character in my dream was saying, but sometimes the truth <i>is</i> corny). And Lesley had said sympathetically, &#x201c;I know just how you feel. When Max dumped me, I thought at first I&#x2019;d die of grief. Grief and multiple organ failure. Because there&#x2019;s a grain of truth in all those things they say about love: it goes to your kidneys, it punches you in the stomach, it breaks your heart and&nbsp;&#x2026; er&nbsp;&#x2026; it scurries over your liver like a louse. But first, that will all pass off; second, it&#x2019;s not as hopeless as it looks to you; and third, your heart isn&#x2019;t made of glass.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stone, not glass,&#x201d; I corrected her, sobbing. &#x201c;My heart is a gemstone, and Gideon&#x2019;s broken it into thousands of pieces, just like in Aunt Maddy&#x2019;s vision.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds kind of cool&#x2014;but no! Hearts are really made of very different stuff, you take my word for it.&#x201d; Lesley cleared her throat, and her tone of voice got positively solemn, as if she were revealing the greatest secret in the history of the world. &#x201c;Hearts are made of something much tougher. It&#x2019;s unbreakable, and you can reshape it anytime you like. Hearts are made to a secret formula.&#x201d; <br>More throat-clearing to heighten the suspense. I instinctively held my breath. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re made of stuff like <i>marzipan</i>!&#x201d; Lesley announced. <br>&#x201c;Marzipan?&#x201d; For a moment I stopped sobbing and grinned instead. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, marzipan,&#x201d; Lesley repeated in deadly earnest. &#x201c;The best sort, with lots of real ground almonds in it.&#x201d; <br>I almost giggled. But then I remembered that I was the unhappiest girl in the world. I sniffed, and said, &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s so, then Gideon has <i>bitten off</i> a piece of my heart! And he&#x2019;s nibbled away the chocolate coating around it too! You ought to have seen the way he looked when&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>But before I could start crying all over again, Lesley sighed audibly. <br>&#x201c;Gwenny, I hate to say so, but all this miserable weeping and wailing does no one any good. You have to stop it!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not doing it on purpose,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;It just keeps on breaking out of me. One moment I&#x2019;m still the happiest girl in the world, and then he tells me he&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, so Gideon behaved like a bastard,&#x201d; Lesley interrupted me, &#x201c;although it&#x2019;s hard to understand why. I mean, <i>hello</i>? Why on earth would girls in love be easier to manipulate? I&#x2019;d have thought it was just the opposite. Girls in love are like ticking time bombs. You never know what they&#x2019;ll do next. Gideon and his male chauvinist friend the count have made a big mistake.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I really thought Gideon was in love with me. The idea that he was only pretending is so&#x2026;&#x201d; Mean? Cruel? No word seemed enough to describe my feelings properly. <br>&#x201c;Oh, sweetie&#x2014;look, in other circumstances, you could wallow in grief for weeks on end, but you can&#x2019;t afford to do that right now. You need your energy for other things. Like surviving, for instance.&#x201d; Lesley sounded unusually stern. &#x201c;So kindly pull yourself together.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Xemerius said, too. Before he went off and left me all alone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your little invisible monster is right! You have to keep a cool head now and put all the facts together. Ugh, what was that? Hang on, I have to open a window. Bertie just did a disgusting fart. Bad dog! Now, where was I? Yes, that&#x2019;s it, we have to find out what your grandfather hid in your house.&#x201d; Lesley&#x2019;s voice rose slightly. &#x201c;I must admit Raphael has turned out pretty useful. He&#x2019;s not as stupid as you might think.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As <i>you</i> might think, you mean.&#x201d; Raphael was Gideon&#x2019;s little brother, who had just started going to our school. He&#x2019;d discovered that the riddle my grandfather had left behind was all about geographical coordinates. And they had led straight to our house. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to know how much Raphael has found out about the secrets of the Guardians and Gideon&#x2019;s time traveling.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Could be more than we might assume,&#x201d; said Lesley. &#x201c;Anyway, he wasn&#x2019;t swallowing my story when I told him the coordinates were only because puzzle games like this were the latest fad in London. But he was clever enough not to ask any more questions.&#x201d; She paused for a moment. &#x201c;He has rather attractive eyes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d; They really were attractive, which reminded me that Gideon&#x2019;s eyes were exactly the same. Green and surrounded by thick, dark lashes. <br>&#x201c;Not that that impresses me. Only making an observation.&#x201d; <br> <i>I&#x2019;ve fallen in love with you.</i> Gideon had sounded deadly serious when he said that, looking straight at me. And I&#x2019;d stared back and believed every word of it! My tears started flowing again, and I could hardly hear what Lesley was saying. <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; but I hope it&#x2019;s a long letter, or a kind of diary, with your grandfather explaining everything the rest of them won&#x2019;t tell you and a bit more. Then we can finally stop groping around in the dark and make a proper plan.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Eyes like that shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed. Or there ought to be a law saying boys with such gorgeous eyes had to wear sunglasses all the time. Unless they canceled out the eyes by having huge jug ears or something like that. <br>&#x201c;Gwenny? You&#x2019;re not crying again, are you?&#x201d; Now Lesley sounded just like Mrs. Counter, our geography teacher, when people told her they were afraid they&#x2019;d forgotten to do their homework. &#x201c;Sweetie, this won&#x2019;t do! You must stop twisting the knife in your own heart with all this drama! We have to&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Keep a cool head. Yes, you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; It cost me an effort, but I tried to put the thought of Gideon&#x2019;s eyes out of my mind and inject a little confidence into my voice. I owed Lesley that. After all, she was the one who&#x2019;d been propping me up for days. Before she rang off, I had to tell her how glad I was that she was my friend. Even if it made me start to cry again, but this time because it made me so emotional! <br>&#x201c;Same here,&#x201d; Lesley assured me. &#x201c;My life would be dead boring without you!&#x201d; <br>When she ended the call, it was just before midnight, and I really had felt a little better for a few minutes. But now, at ten past three, I&#x2019;d have loved to call her back and go over the whole thing again. <br>Not that I was naturally inclined to be such a Moaning Minnie. It&#x2019;s just that this was the first time in my life I&#x2019;d ever suffered from unrequited love. Real unrequited love, I mean. The sort that genuinely hurts. Everything else retreated into the background. Even survival didn&#x2019;t seem to matter. Honestly, the thought of dying didn&#x2019;t seem so bad at that moment. I wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to die of a broken heart, after all&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be in good company. There was the Little Mermaid, Juliet, Pocahontas, the Lady of the Camellias, Madame Butterfly&#x2014;and now me, Gwyneth Shepherd. The good part of it was that I could leave out anything dramatic with a knife, as suggested by Lesley&#x2019;s remark, because the way I felt now, I must have caught TB ages ago, and dying of consumption is much the most picturesque way to go. I&#x2019;d lie on my bed looking pale and beautiful like Snow White, with my hair spread out on the pillow. Gideon would kneel beside me, feeling bitterly sorry for what he had done when I breathed my last words. <br>But first I had to go to the toilet, urgently. <br>Peppermint tea with masses of lemon and sugar was a cure for all ills in our family, and I must have drunk pints of it. Because when I came in yesterday evening, my mother had noticed right away that I wasn&#x2019;t feeling good. It wasn&#x2019;t difficult to spot that, because crying had made me look like an albino rabbit. And if I&#x2019;d told her&#x2014;as Xemerius suggested&#x2014;that I&#x2019;d had to chop onions in the limousine on the way home from the Guardians&#x2019; headquarters, she&#x2019;d never have believed my story. <br>&#x201c;Have those damn Guardians been doing something to you? What happened?&#x201d; she had asked, managing to sound sympathetic and furiously angry at the same time. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll murder Falk if&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s done anything to me, Mum,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said quickly, to reassure her. &#x201c;And nothing has happened.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As if she was going to believe that! Why didn&#x2019;t you try the onion excuse? You never take my good advice.&#x201d; Xemerius had stamped his clawed feet on the floor. He was a small stone gargoyle demon with big ears, bat&#x2019;s wings, a scaly tail like a dragon, and two little horns on a catlike head. Unfortunately he wasn&#x2019;t half as cute as he looked, and no one except me could hear his outrageous remarks and answer him back. There were two odd things about me, by the way, and I just had to live with them. One was that I&#x2019;d been able to see gargoyle demons and other ghosts and talk to them from early childhood. The other was even odder, and I hadn&#x2019;t known about it until under two weeks ago, when I found out that I was one of a strictly secret bunch of twelve time travelers, which meant going back to somewhere in the past for a couple of hours every day. The curse of time travel&#x2014;well, okay, so it was supposed to be a gift&#x2014;ought to have affected my cousin Charlotte, who&#x2019;d have been much better at it, but it turned out that I&#x2019;d drawn the short straw. No reason why I should be surprised. I was always left holding the last card when we played Old Maid; if we cast lots in class to see who bought Mrs. Counter&#x2019;s Christmas gift, I always got the piece of paper with her name on it (and how do you decide what to give a geography teacher?); if I had tickets for a concert, you could bet I&#x2019;d fall sick; and when I particularly wanted to look good, I got a zit on my forehead the size of a third eye. Some people may not understand right away how a zit is like time travel&#x2014;they may even envy me and think time travel would be fun, but it isn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s a nuisance, nerve-racking and dangerous as well. Not forgetting that if I hadn&#x2019;t inherited that stupid gift I&#x2019;d never have met Gideon and then my heart, whether or not it was made of marzipan, would still be just fine. Because that guy was another of the twelve time travelers. One of the few still alive. You couldn&#x2019;t meet the others except back in the past. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been crying,&#x201d; my mother had said in a matter-of-fact way. <br>&#x201c;There, you see?&#x201d; Xemerius had said. &#x201c;Now she&#x2019;s going to squeeze you like a lemon until the pips squeak. She won&#x2019;t let you out of her sight for a second, and we can wave good-bye to tonight&#x2019;s treasure hunt.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;d made a face at him, to let him know that I didn&#x2019;t feel like treasure hunting tonight anymore. Well, you have to make faces at invisible friends if you don&#x2019;t want other people to think you&#x2019;re crazy because you talk to the empty air. <br>&#x201c;Tell her you were trying out the pepper spray,&#x201d; the empty air had answered me back, &#x201c;and it got into your own eyes by mistake.&#x201d; <br>But I&#x2019;d been far too tired to tell lies. I just looked at my mum with red-rimmed eyes and tried telling the truth. <i>Here goes, then</i>, I&#x2019;d thought. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;&#x2026; no, I don&#x2019;t feel too good. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; kind of a girl thing, you know?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, darling.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I phone Lesley, I know I&#x2019;ll feel better.&#x201d; <br>Much to the surprise of Xemerius&#x2014;me too&#x2014;Mum had been satisfied with this explanation. She made me peppermint tea, left the teapot and my favorite cup with its pattern of spots on my bedside table, stroked my hair, and otherwise left me in peace. She didn&#x2019;t even keep reminding me of the time, as usual. (&#x201c;Gwyneth! It&#x2019;s after ten, and you&#x2019;ve been on the phone for forty minutes. You&#x2019;ll be seeing each other at school tomorrow.&#x201d;) Sometimes she really was the best mother in the world. <br>Sighing, I swung my legs over the edge of the bed and stumbled off to the bathroom. I felt a cold breath of air. <br>&#x201c;Xemerius? Are you there?&#x201d; I asked under my breath, and felt for the light switch. <br>&#x201c;That depends.&#x201d; Xemerius was dangling head down from the ceiling fixture in the corridor, blinking at the light. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here so long as you don&#x2019;t turn back into a watering can.&#x201d; He raised his voice to a shrill, tearful pitch as he imitated me&#x2014;rather well, I&#x2019;m sorry to say. &#x201c; <i>And then he said, I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about, and then I said, yes or no, and then he said, yes, but do stop crying.&#x2026;</i>&#x201d; He sighed theatrically. &#x201c;Girls get on my nerves worse than any other kind of human being. Along with retired taxmen, saleswomen in hosiery departments, and presidents of community garden societies.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t guarantee anything,&#x201d; I whispered, so as not to wake the rest of my family up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better not mention You Know Who, or the indoor fountain will come back on again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was sick of the sound of his name anyway. Can we do something sensible for a change? Go treasure hunting, for instance?&#x201d; <br>Getting some sleep might have been sensible, but unfortunately I was wide awake now. &#x201c;Okay, we can start if you like. But first I have to get rid of all that tea.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>I pointed to the bathroom door. <br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; said Xemerius. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just wait here.&#x201d; <br>I looked better than I expected in the bathroom mirror. Unfortunately there wasn&#x2019;t a sign of galloping consumption. My eyelids were a little swollen&#x2014;that was all, as if I&#x2019;d been using pink eye shadow and put on too much. <br>&#x201c;Where were you all this time, Xemerius?&#x201d; I asked when I came out into the corridor again. &#x201c;Not by any chance ...</p><h2>Nearby History: Exploring the Past Around You (American Association for State and Local History)</h2><p>Nearby History by David E. Kyvig and Myron A. Marty is one of the essential volumes on any public historian&#x2019;s bookshelf and syllabus. Whereas every other &#x201c;how to do history&#x201d; book seems aimed at fledgling academic historians and grounds its advice on academic libraries and footnoting, it is Nearby History that shows the reader how to do hands-on public history research with the resources found in every community. First published in 1984, the book remains as important as ever. And yet the world of historical research has changed since 1984--not just the explosion of online historical sources but also the possibilities of using digital cameras and scanners for research, digital communities for historical collaboration, and podcasts, smartphone apps and websites to present research and interpretations of nearby history. It is time for an update.<br><br>Newly updated by Larry Cebula, this fourth edition of Nearby History is a comprehensive handbook for those interested in investigating the history of communities, families, local institutions, and cultural artifacts, Nearby History helps its readers research the world near at hand. In this fourth edition, the authors discuss a variety of research approaches involving published literature, unpublished documents, oral histories, visual and material sources, and landscapes; offer guidance in the uses of technology, particularly digital photography and digital voice recording; and suggest methods of historical presentation. The authors also explore the promise and pitfalls of research in the digital age.

Each person is created in the Image of God (dignity) and has a purpose (vocation), but people face social problems such as poverty or discrimination that limit this expression. This book shows how ministers can caring for systems, arenas such as health care, education, and employment. Even traumatic events such as abuse and suicide are linked with social factors like unemployment, so understanding the impact of systems on pastoral care is an essential part of ministry in the twenty-first century. This book combines theological reflection, psychological insights, social science research, and accessible case studies to provide an indispensable introductory text for seminary students and experienced ministers alike. The book shows how human life is a journey lived out in relationship to God. Each chapter tells a compelling story, whether adult survivors of abuse, suicide, intimate partner violence, poverty, racial reconciliation, dementia, and grief, and draws theological conclusions with direct practical importance from the narrative. Students reading this text will have tools to reflect theologically on practices of pastoral care and counseling. Rather than splitting pastoral ministry into subtopics, the Care for Stories, Systems, and Self framework fosters a balanced, wise, and theologically reflective approach to ministry in a variety of settings.</p><p>Philip Browning Helsel is a board-certified chaplain and ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church USA who is associate professor of pastoral care at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Having taught previously at Boston College&#39;s School for Theology and Ministry, he has more than a decade of experience in counseling, chaplaincy, and congregational ministry. He is passionate about fostering deeper pastoral care that is empowering and destigmatizing.How do we perceive God? Whereas traditional theologians believed that we do so through a rational soul that is distinct from the body, contemporary theologians acknowledge that our consciousness, our awareness of life, and our spiritual connection to the holy are profoundly rooted in our bodily human condition. It is encouraging to see a number of recent books in practical theology that emphasize the importance of how we encounter, practice, and proclaim theology as embodied human souls. One such book is Philip Hensel s Pastoral Care and Counseling, Paulist Press 9780809153909 Helsel masters the adage of show, don t tell as he invites readers into stories of caregiving in contexts that are varied, complicated, and classic. While drawing upon extensive recent literature in the field, he lets the stories convey the basics of wise practice. He includes stories about poverty, the grief of suicide survivors, the trauma of domestic abuse, the suffering of addiction, and the violation of sexual boundaries in the church. He shows how caregivers can help people feel remembered by God in the midst of such daunting struggles, and how congregations can also advocate for necessary social and political change. Offering theological reflection at every turn, Helsel shows how reflective theological practice can undergird a faithful pastoral ministry.

When the clouds covering Mount Kenya part one morning to reveal its towering peaks for the first time, prisoner of war Felice Benuzzi is transfixed. The tedium of camp life is broken by the beginnings of a sudden idea - an outrageous, dangerous, brilliant idea. There are not many people who would break out of a P.O.W. camp, trek for days across perilous terrain before climbing the north face of Mount Kenya with improvised equipment, meagre rations, and with a picture of the mountain on a tin of beef among their more accurate guides. There are probably fewer still who would break back in to the camp on their return. But this is the remarkable story of three such men. No Picnic on Mount Kenya is a powerful testament to the human spirit of revolt and adventure in even the darkest of places. &#34;The history of mountaineering can hardly present a parallel to this mad but thrilling escapade&#34; - Saturday Review &#34;A most extraordinary prisoner-of-war and escape story&#34; - New Yorker &#34;A mad venture and a gallant tribute to man&#39;s deep yearning for freedom&#34; - Kirkus Reviews &#34;The book crackles with the same dry humour as its title . It contains the prison-yard bartering and candlelight stitching that mark a classic jailbreak yarn ; the encounters with wild beasts in Mount Kenya&#39;s forest belt are as gripping , and the descriptions of sparkling glaciers as awe-inspiring, as any passage in the great exploration diaries of the early 20th century&#34; - The Economist</p><p>Felice Benuzzi was born in Vienna in 1910 and grew up in Trieste, doing his early mountaineering in the Julian Alps. He studied law at Rome University and represented Italy as an international swimmer in 1933-35. Following the conclusion of the war he worked as a diplomat, including with the United Nations. He died in Rome in 1988.Mr. Benuzzi&#39;s paradoxical mixture of pride and self-mocking humility is attractive: his courage is amazing; his story, dramatic New York Times Felice Benuzzi&#39;s tale is a real joy. An extraordinary adventure written with a light, deft, humorous touch that makes it irresistibly readable.

He was a professor at Columbia University.<b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Leon Wieseltier</b> is the editor of <i>The New Republic </i>and lives in New York City.</p>Trilling (1905^-74) was an enormously influential critic who vehemently eschewed simplistic or emotional responses to art or morality. The author of many works, he was especially exigent, to use one of his favorite words, in his essays, most of which have long been out of print. Republished now in this substantial volume edited and vividly introduced by Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor for the <i>New Republic</i> and author of <i>Kaddish</i> (1998), these essays and lectures, still fresh and provocative, cover topics ranging from Austen, James, and Frost to the connections between art, neurosis, and politics. Distrustful of rapture and keen on reading literature as, in Wieseltier's words, "documents for a moral history of culture," Trilling embraced complexity and nuance and held critical integrity in the highest esteem. His essays possess great intellectual weight, and their richness, deep seriousness of thought, and sonorous vocabulary and syntax are balanced by a lashing wit and remarkable energy. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He has earned millions of dollars for his hedge fund over the last thirty years shorting the stocks of businesses he believed were on their way to bankruptcy. In <i>Dead Companies Walking</i>, Fearon describes his methods for spotting these doomed businesses, and how they can be extremely profitable investments. In his experience, corporate managers routinely commit six common mistakes that can derail even the most promising companies: they learn from only the recent past; they rely too heavily on a formula for success; they misunderstand their target customers; they fall victim to the magical storytelling of a mania; they fail to adapt to tectonic shifts in their industry; and they are physically or emotionally removed from their companies' operations. </p><p>Fearon has interviewed thousands of executives across America, many of whom, unknowingly, were headed toward bankruptcy &#x2013; from the Texas oil barons of the 80s to the tech wunderkinds of the late 90s to the flush real estate developers of the mid-2000s. Here, he explores recent examples like JC Penney, Herbalife and Blockbuster Entertainment to help investors better predict the next booms and busts&#x2015;and come out on top.</p></p><p>Scott Fearon worked as a stock analyst and mutual fund manager before launching his own hedge fund, Crown Capital Management, in 1991.

Narcissus, an ascetic instructor at a cloister school, has devoted himself solely to scholarly and spiritual pursuits. One of his students is the sensual, restless Goldmund, who is immediately drawn to his teacher's fierce intellect and sense of discipline. When Narcissus persuades the young student that he is not meant for a life of self-denial, Goldmund sets off in pursuit of aesthetic and physical pleasures, a path that leads him to a final, unexpected reunion with Narcissus.</p></p><p>Hesse's novel of two medieval men, one quietly content with his religion and monastic life, the other in fervent search of more worldly salvation. This conflict between flesh and spirit, between emotional and contemplative man, was a life study for Hesse. It is a theme that transcends all time. The Hesse Phenomenon "has turned into a vogue, the vogue into a torrent. . .He has appealed both to. . . an underground and to an establishment. . .and to the disenchanted young sharing his contempt for our industrial civilization."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p><b>Hermann Hesse</b> was born in Germany in 1877 and later became a citizen of Switzerland. As a Western man profoundly affected by the mysticism of Eastern thought, he wrote novels, stories, and essays bearing a vital spiritual force that has captured the imagination and loyalty of many generations of readers. His works include <i>Steppenwolf</i>, <i>Narcissus and Goldmund</i>, and <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946.

Was the <i>Arrested Development </i>Netflix season brilliant or terrible?<br><br>For twenty years-since they shared a TV column at Tony Soprano's hometown newspaper-critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz have been debating these questions and many more, but it all ultimately boils down to this: <br><br><b>What's the greatest TV show ever?<br><br></b> That debate reaches an epic conclusion in TV (THE BOOK). Sepinwall and Seitz have identified and ranked the 100 greatest scripted shows in American TV history.

American military doctrine is typically led by technology; a new class of weapon or vehicle is developed, which allows or encourages an adjustment in strategy. Military strategists Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui argue that this dynamic is a crucial weakness in the American military, and that this blind spot with regard to alternative forms warfare could be effectively exploited by enemies. <i>Unrestricted Warfare</i> concerns the many ways in which this might occur, and, in turn, suggests what the United States might do to defend itself.</p><p> The traditional mentality that offensive action is limited to military action is no longer adequate given the range of contemporary threats and the rising costs-both in dollars and lives lost-of traditional warfare. Instead, Liang and Xiangsui suggest the significance of alternatives to direct military confrontation, including international policy, economic warfare, attacks on digital infrastructure and networks, and terrorism. Even a relatively insignificant state can incapacitate a far more powerful enemy by applying pressure to their economic and political systems. Exploring each of these considerations with remarkable insight and clarity, <i>Unrestricted Warfare</i> is an engaging evaluation of our geopolitical future.</p><p></p></p><p>The 9/11 attacks may just be the beginning.

For more than 30 years now, Ann Weiser Cornell has been exploring, teaching, and writing about the mysteries of emotional process, including the paradox of how we become more whole by acknowledging our parts, how the most despised places in us contain our greatest treasure, and how the body&#39;s felt sense, held in a compassionate state of Presence, is the key to change.

She shows how use became associated with life and strength in nineteenth-century biological and social thought and considers how utilitarianism offered a set of educational techniques for shaping individuals by directing them toward useful ends. Ahmed also explores how spaces become restricted to some uses and users, with specific reference to universities. She notes, however, the potential for <i>queer use</i>: how things can be used in ways that were not intended or by those for whom they were not intended. Ahmed posits queer use as a way of reanimating the project of diversity work as the ordinary and painstaking task of opening up institutions to those who have historically been excluded.</p><p>Sara Ahmed is an independent scholar and author of <i>Living a Feminist Life</i> and several other books also published by Duke University Press.&#x201c;How lucky we are that feminist killjoy Sara Ahmed takes us on her learned, witty, and insightful journey.

When Zeina's parents don't return one afternoon from a visit to the other half of the city and the bombing grows ever closer, the neighbors in her apartment house create a world indoors for Zeina and her brother where it's comfy and safe, where they can share cooking lessons and games and gossip.

Both women write about their childhoods in the Middle East. Both write about their families. Even the two books' illustrations, black-and-white, geometric and highly stylized, have a similar feel: the images of women with almond-shaped eyes and prominent beauty marks, surrounded by heavy whirls of cigarette smoke.<br>And like Satrapi, Abirached approaches her personal story ambitiously, weaving the stories of her family members and their circle of neighbors and acquaintances into a tapestry of everyday life in war-torn East Beirut. Their tales are fascinating, and often brutal in their details.<br>Abirached's own story takes place on an afternoon in 1984. Abirached is a little girl, and her parents have left to visit her grandmother Annie, who lives a few blocks away. It is just an ordinary family visit. But the city is at war, and a sniper is positioned between the two homes. Abirached and her brother stay home, anxiously awaiting their parents' return. During the course of the afternoon, neighbors come and go, and with them, relate their experiences, which provide digressions from the main narrative.Life in 1980s Beirut is treacherous. There is the constant threat of artillery, random shootings and planned assassinations. The apartment Abirached lives in no longer has running water or electricity. The chandelier in a neighbor's apartment hangs close to the ground, rattling with each detonation. The children tell stories and make up games in the cramped foyer, taking breaks to eavesdrop on adult conversation.<br>'A Game for Swallows' lacks the intimacy and narrative propulsion of Satrapi's masterpiece. Less a story than a portrait of a family and a city and a culture under siege, the narrative unfolds somewhat disjointedly, intentionally perhaps &#x2015; as a means of conveying the haphazard and precarious nature of life in a city beset by civil war. Characters appear and disappear, sometimes without sufficient introduction, and with so many flashbacks breaking up the story line it's hard not to get lost in places.<br>Yet the afternoon of waiting for the parents' return remains grimly tense (a scene in which the family and neighbors call out 'Incoming!' and 'Outgoing!' in response to the explosions outside is terrifyingly real, with the characters faces falling slack during moments of silence and panicked when the bombs explode). The profound dislocation of living in a war zone is palpable on every page. And an ominous question hangs over it all: Will Abirached's parents return? And if they do, what exactly will they be returning to?<br><strong>The book's strengths are myriad. Abirached is a lovely artist, and her characters' faces are remarkably expressive. There is much humor, a welcome relief from the chaos and heartache of the human stories within.</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>For young readers, 'A Game for Swallows' will come as a revelation. At a time when the Middle East is still in turmoil and when Americans have suffered losses of electricity and other necessities during recent storms and floods, this is a story that will hit home even as it causes young, impressionable eyes to look at life abroad.</strong>" --<em>The New York Times</em> (<i>Newspaper</i>)<br><br><p>"A casual browser could be forgiven for picking up this graphic novel and not realizing it wasn't Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis (2003) until a fair way in. With its childlike visual stylization and stark black-and-white forms depicting the life of a young girl in a Middle Eastern country at war, this screams out for comparison to Satrapi's classic. However, while Persepolis examined the political and religious ramifications on a nation through the life of one growing child, Abirached's tale focuses tightly on people and their deep ties to one another as neighbors gather in the Beirut apartment of Zeina and her little brother while they await their parents' return from across a city under siege.<strong> As she puts an accessible face on a foreign culture through her characters, Abirached also distinguishes her piece with striking and unique design work. Her use of heavily contrasted black-and-white spaces, as well as elegant flourishes like crowding an anxious room with ticks and tocks, suggests an impressive new talent following in the footsteps of an established master.</strong>" --<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br>Zeina Abirached's evocative memoir, translated from French and told in a graphic novel format, opens with an attractive skyline of East Beirut in 1984. As the perspective zooms in, the initial beauty gives way to empty streets, windows protected by cinder blocks, rooftops lined with barbed wire, electrical wires dangling from homes, and rows upon rows of steel drums indicating the Green Line, a demarcation line separating Muslim and Christian factions during the Lebanese Civil War, which took place from 1975 to 1990. The author&#x2019;s apartment building looks out over this demarcation line. <br>On the evening this story takes place, a young Zeina and her even younger brother, await the return of their parents, who have gone to visit their grandmother. Although she only lives a few blocks away, her apartment is situated on the other side of the Green Line and requires Zeina's parents to follow a precise path to avoid sniper fire. One by one, Zeina's nine apartment neighbors gather in her tiny foyer, an interior and therefore safer room in the building. Among them are Chucri, whose taxi driver father was murdered at the beginning of the war and whose generator keeps the building running during routine blackouts, a young couple expecting their first child and awaiting emigration to Canada, and Ernest, a former high school French teacher whose identical twin brother was killed by a sniper. <br>Reminiscent of Marjane Satrapi's <em>Persepolis</em>, the black-and-white artwork, at first glance minimal and stark, keenly displays these neighbors' wide range of emotions. As they drink strong Turkish coffee and eat stouf (a cake made of flour, oil, sugar, and turmeric), the neighbors play cards, act out scenes from Cyrano, and discuss baby names while trying to forget the noise of gunfire outside and the growing absence of Zeina's parents. Their time together underscores the toll the war has taken as Farah, always carrying a small bag with passports and ready cash, shows off wedding pictures she keeps in a box, one of her few possessions after her last apartment burned. <br>Despite the war around them, these neighbors have never forgotten community and compassion. Chucri contributes lettuce (washed, no less, when there is no running water) to the meal. The neighbors' simple sharing of food and memories eases fears on this particularly violent night. <strong>While this thought-provoking memoir educates American readers on this foreign war, it also encourages them to appreciate their own freedom, safety, and comforts and to build their own communities. One night can change a lifetime.</strong>" --<em>Foreword Magazine</em> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"Comparisons to Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis are inevitable; like Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novel, this book (also first published in French) presents a girlhood under fire in the war-torn Middle East. Here the setting is 1984 Beirut, a city segregated by religion with Christian and Muslim residents locked in unrelenting civil war. The story's focus is a single harrowing night when Zeina's parents, visiting her grandparents a few blocks away, must make their way home through heavy bombing. Neighbors have gathered in the family's foyer&#x2015;the safest place left&#x2015;to wait out the shelling and hope for Zeina's parents' return. Abirached skillfully weaves flashbacks and explanatory asides into the narrative while maintaining the evening's tension. Despite the oppressive atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, much-needed moments of levity shine through as neighbors try to distract Zeina, her younger brother, and themselves by telling amusing anecdotes, re-enacting scenes from Cyrano de Bergerac, baking a cake, and partaking of fine whiskey. <strong>Stark, dramatic illustrations (mostly black backgrounds with white-outlined characters and features) include repeated motifs (flowers, dragons) that effectively capture elements of the culture and lend nuance to the high emotions through small changes in expression or detail. A poignant portrayal of a community determined to hold onto optimism and humanity under dire circumstances</strong>." --<em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"A stark look at the civil war in Lebanon in the 1980s, as seen through the eyes of a child anxiously awaiting her parents' arrival from her grandmother's house on the other side of the demarcation line.<br> <br>With shells and gunfire delivering staccato bursts of violence, young Zeina and her brother have been sequestered within the small foyer in their apartment. This tiny room offers the most protection from the constant artillery fire, and it becomes a place for neighbors in the building to congregate and seek asylum. Though war is raging and death always seems to loom near with shells falling and snipers possibly crouching behind every wall, Zeina and her neighbors try to live the best they can&#x2015;making cakes, acting out scenes from Cyrano de Bergerac and drinking strong Turkish coffee. Through austere black-and-white illustrations (with a detectable influence from Persepolis' Marjane Satrapi), Abirached easily conveys the overarching sense of unease and how something as simple as a visit to grandma&#x2019;s can inspire fear. <strong>Abirached&#x2019;s readers will instantly empathize with those who do not readily have access to simple luxuries many take for granted&#x2015;running water, electricity or the simple return of our loved ones from an outing&#x2015;and this may perhaps spur them to re-examine what they may have otherwise overlooked. <br><br>Quietly mesmerizing and thought-provoking</strong>." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Zeina and her younger brother are growing up in Beirut, where civil war is a part of daily life. To protect against strikes and sniper fire, the family's living space has been reduced to the relative security of their apartment foyer, where a rug hanging on the wall, depicting Moses and the Hebrews fleeing Egypt, figures predominantly as a story background. This account chronicles one day in their lives, as the siblings await their parents' return and neighbors come and spend time with them, building an island of sanctuary for the children during this time of uncertainty. <strong>Bold, graphic, black-and-white images are visually and emotionally striking.</strong> Excellent use of maps and diagrams provides reference points and enhances understanding of spatial relationships. Unique panel placement includes several sequences of horizontal strips, read as columns. Images portray elapsed time, such as repeated smoking and countdown panels, and control pacing while revealing mounting tension. Excruciating wait time is depicted with cumulative 'tic' and 'toc' filling successive panels. Circular images of an embracing family contrast with the stark linear images of a war-torn country. Warmth and humor of daily life is shown in baking and storytelling, and wedding-dress close-ups touchingly highlight a mother's worry over soiling the hem, masking her worry over sniper fire. <strong>This superb memoir is destined to become a classic</strong>." --starred, <em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In the tradition of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, Lebanese author-artist Abirached offers readers a memory of her childhood in war-torn Beirut.

It provides them with the theoretical background to knowledgeably evaluate the many new ideas that emerge in the current literature, and in workshops and conferences. The purpose is to help leaders develop their own effective management style and approaches, and feel confident that their actions are informed by appropriate theory and knowledge of the latest research in the field.<br><br>Without theory, organizational leaders are forced to treat each problem that they encounter as unique&#x2013;as if it were a first-time occurrence. While leaders may have some experience with a particular issue, their solutions are usually not informed by the accumulated wisdom of others who have already encountered and resolved similar situations. <br><br>The authors approach the theory of the organization and administration of colleges and universities from three quite different perspectives, or paradigms, each relying on different assumptions about the &#x201c;reality&#x201d; of organizational life in colleges and universities. <br><br>The positivist paradigm&#x2013;primarily an omnibus systems theory&#x2013;integrates the chapters into a comprehensive, yet easily accessible whole. Social constructionism, the second paradigm, is introduced in each chapter to illuminate the difficulty of seeking and finding meaningful consensus on problems and policies, while also addressing important ethical issues that tend to be overlooked in leadership thought and action. The third paradigm, postmodernism, draws attention to difficulties of logic and communication under the constraints of strictly linear thinking that &#x201c;authorities&#x201d; at all levels attempt to impose on organizations.<br><br>This &#x201c;multiple paradigm&#x201d; approach enables readers to become more cognizant of their own assumptions, how they may differ from those of others in their organization, and how those differences may both create difficulties in resolving problems and expand the range of alternatives considered in organizational decision making. <br><br>The book offers readers the tools to balance the real-world needs to succeed in today&#x2019;s challenging and competitive environment with the social and ethical aspirations of all its stakeholders and society at large. The authors&#x2019; aim is to elucidate how administration can be made more efficient and effective through rational decision-making while also respecting humanistic values. This approach highlights a range of phenomena that require attention if the institution is ultimately to be considered successful.<br><br>Also available:<br>Volume 1: The State of the System<br>Two volume set</p><p>This two-volume work is intended to help readers develop powerful new ways of thinking about organizational principles, and apply them to policy-making and management in colleges and universities.<br><br>It systematically presents a range of theories that can be applied to many of the difficult management situations that college and university leaders encounter.

But when he flees, taking Toshi's bike and cell phone with him, the four girls get caught up in a tempest of dangers that rise from within them as well as from the world around them.

Several of her books have also been turned into feature movies. <b>Out</b> was the first of her novels to appear in English and was nominated for an Edgar Award.

It&#x2019;s happened every day since summer vacation started, so it&#x2019;s no surprise. &#x201c;May I have your attention,&#x201d; this woman&#x2019;s voice drawls over a loudspeaker. &#x201c;An air pollution advisory has just been issued,&#x201d; and the siren continues to drone on, like some kindly old dinosaur groaning away.<br><br>Most of these advisories happen in the morning, usually just as I&#x2019;m about to leave for cram school. Nobody does anything because of them. Everyone kind of goes, Oh, <i>that</i> again. What I&#x2019;d like to know is where they hide those speakers. To me, that&#x2019;s creepier and weirder than anything about smog.<br><br>I live in a crowded residential area on the outskirts of Suginami-ku in Tokyo. It used to be a nice, laid-back neighborhood, but all the old, larger houses got torn down, replaced by smaller single-family homes and apartments. When I was little, several neat but tiny buildings went up where there used to be plum orchards and farm fields. They slapped fancy names on these&#x2014;<i>Estates</i> or whatever&#x2014;to help sell units. Nice-looking families moved in, and on weekends you&#x2019;d see them out walking their dogs or driving around in expensive foreign cars. But the paved roads that run through the neighborhood, which must have been just dirt farm paths at one time, are so narrow that I heard the family two houses down from us had so much trouble parking their Mercedes-Benz in their garage that they ended up getting rid of it.<br><br>The siren keeps on droning. Right in between one of its groans, I hear a loud sound, something breaking next door. Our houses are so close that if you open the window, you can hear the parents yelling at each other, or the phone ringing. I&#x2019;m thinking maybe a window broke. Seven years ago the boy who lives in the house diagonally across from us kicked a soccer ball that shattered a window in our house in the room where we keep our Buddhist altar. The kid completely ignored what happened, and later on he was transferred to a school in Kansai. I remember the abandoned soccer ball sitting there under the eaves of my house forever.<br><br>Anyway, the sound I&#x2019;d heard was just like that time. There aren&#x2019;t any little kids living next door, so it&#x2019;s weird to hear something shatter so loudly, and the whole thing was kind of alarming. Maybe a burglar broke in. My heart beating like mad, I listened carefully but didn&#x2019;t hear anything else. Total silence.<br><br>The neighbors moved in two years ago. We&#x2019;ve had hardly anything to do with them. Sometimes, when I take the neighborhood association bulletin to them, I&#x2019;ll press the intercom bell and the mother will come out, this phony smile pasted on her face. All I know for sure is that there&#x2019;s a mom and a dad, and a boy the same age as me who lives there. Sometimes the mother is out front, sweeping with a bamboo broom. She has on silver-framed glasses and this bright red lipstick you know is going to leave marks on any teacup she uses. Get rid of the glasses and the lipstick, though, and I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d recognize her.<br><br>Once when the woman next door saw me in my school uniform she asked, &#x201c;Are you a high school student?&#x201d; When I said yes, she said, &#x201c;So is our son,&#x201d; and named the prestigious high school he attended, smiling happily. When I told my mom this, she clicked her tongue and looked disgusted. The woman was obviously bragging about her son and Mom must have thought she was insulting us, since I was going to a less-than-stellar private girls&#x2019; school. But I just thought the woman next door was simple and naive, and I felt sorry for the boy for having such an embarrassing mother.<br><br>This son of hers was a lanky, stoop-shouldered boy with small, gloomy eyes. Reminded me of a worm. He had a sluggish way of walking with his head tilted to one side, and zero in the way of spirit. Even when our paths happened to cross at the station he&#x2019;d avoid looking at me and edge off into the shadows of the building. Like if he stepped into the shadows he could hide from the world. In that sense he was just like his father, who looked like a typical office worker. The father ignored me as if I didn&#x2019;t even exist. Once I went out to get the evening paper when he was just coming home. I nodded to him but he gazed off into the distance like I was invisible.<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder what that guy does for a living, anyway,&#x201d; my mother once said. &#x201c;Kind of stuck-up with that ascot of his.&#x201d; Who cares about ascot ties? was my reaction. To me people are divided into two groups: the nice and the un-nice. And the family next door was definitely in the second category. If my grandmother were still alive she would have sniffed out all kinds of gossip about them, but my mother couldn&#x2019;t be bothered, so the only details we knew about them were that their son looked like a worm, the mother wore red lipstick, and the father, an ascot.<br><br>Still, I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what that sound was. A burglar could break into their house for all I cared, but I didn&#x2019;t want him coming into ours. I started to panic. My parents were both at work, I had slept in late and was about to have some cup ramen before heading out to summer cram school&#x2014;I was a senior in high school&#x2014;and the last thing I wanted was for some burglar to flee into our place. Dad always said that the scariest thing was a thief who gets cornered and turns violent.<br><br>I heard another crash, this one louder than the first. It rang in my ears, and I flinched and messed up my left eyebrow. Maybe I should redo it, I was thinking, staring into the mirror, when my cell phone on the table buzzed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yo!&#x201d; It could only be Terauchi. &#x201c;Dude, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just heard this weird sound from next door&#x2014;maybe a robber or something. What should I do?&#x201d;<br><br>But Terauchi wasn&#x2019;t paying any attention.<br><br>&#x201c;That essay on Mori Ogai we&#x2019;re supposed to write? I&#x2019;ve done over a hundred pages, right? Just kidding . . . But I think it&#x2019;s going to turn out okay, know what I mean?&#x201d; She rambled on like this for a minute or so.<br><br>&#x201c;Terauchi. <i>Listen</i> to me. A burglar might have broken into the house next door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Du&#x2014;de</i>!&#x201d; Terauchi was finally surprised and her usual greeting now turned into an interjection. Terauchi was a cute-looking girl, but her voice was really low and cool. Among my friends, she was the smartest and the most interesting.<br><br>&#x201c;I just heard glass shattering,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Someone breaking in, maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably just the husband and wife having a fight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At this time of the morning?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The guy next door should be at work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, maybe the wife lost it and smashed a teacup or something. It&#x2019;s gotta be that,&#x201d; she declared. &#x201c;You know, one time when my mom got into a fight with my dad&#x2019;s mother she went nuts and tossed both of their teacups and plates out the second-story window.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your mom&#x2019;s kind of extreme.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got that right,&#x201d; Terauchi said. &#x201c;She just casually tossed the plates and cups out, aiming at the stepping-stones in the garden. See, Dad was using the plates Yukinari used as a baby. Anyway, Toshi-chan, I wanted to see how you&#x2019;re doing with your essay.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Toshi-chan</i>. My name&#x2019;s Toshiko Yamanaka, the characters for <i>Toshi</i> meaning &#x201c;ten and four,&#x201d; because I was born on the fourth day of the tenth month, October. Obviously not a lot of thought went into naming me, but since I&#x2019;ve hardly ever met anyone with the same characters, I don&#x2019;t mind the name that much. Terauchi&#x2019;s first name is Kazuko, which she can&#x2019;t stand. Her grandfather in Akita gave her the name, apparently. My friends all call one another by their first names or by nicknames, except for Terauchi, who insists that we call her by her last name.<br><br>&#x201c;The thing is, I haven&#x2019;t done it yet,&#x201d; I admitted.<br><br>When we got to be seniors our Japanese teacher assigned us to write an essay on Ogai&#x2019;s story &#x201c;The Dancing Girl.&#x201d; Terauchi was always good at exams and assignments. Whenever we had to write a book report, she copied parts of some published essay on the book without the teachers ever catching on. I was a little too honest&#x2014;honest to a fault, you could say&#x2014;to try to get away with something like that. So unfortunately it took me a lot of time to finish up assignments and my grades were never as good as hers. I never thought of what she did as dishonest; I was kind of vaguely worried that someday her cleverness might really her get in trouble. I worried about her because I liked her so much.<br><br>She went on, rumbling in her low voice: &#x201c;I was thinking of, like, doing a psychological analysis of the main character.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Including Elise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah&#x2014;not her. Her name&#x2019;s in katakana. What&#x2019;s his name&#x2014;Oda?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have a clue what she was talking about.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not it,&#x201d; a different voice replied. Now it was Yuzan on the phone. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gonna do a psychological profile based on the Chinese characters used to write the name. Can you imagine getting away with that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yuzan, I didn&#x2019;t know you were there,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>I must have sounded a little disappointed. I wasn&#x2019;t exactly happy to find out that she and Terauchi were hanging out without me. It made me feel left out. I really liked Terauchi, but Yuzan was harder to deal with. She had such extreme likes and dislikes. She hated smokers violently, for instance. Human garbage, she said. Which was kind of unfair from the smoker&#x2019;s viewpoint. On the other hand, if she liked somebody she&#x2019;d stand up for them, no matter what. Extreme and hard to read&#x2014;that was Yuzan.<br><br>&#x201c;Terauchi wanted to do homework together. I told her we&#x2019;re not in grade school anymore. Duh!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I bet that it was <i>your</i> idea,&#x201d; I countered.<br><br>Yuzan just laughed this off. Her voice was even lower than Terauchi&#x2019;s, and when she wore her school uniform she looked like some guy doing a lousy job of dressing in drag. Her personality and the way she spoke were totally like a guy; but her name, Kiyomi Kaibara, was very feminine. The nickname Yuzan, of course, came from Yuzan Kaibara, the father character in the manga Oishinbo. When she was in junior high, her mom died after a long stay in the hospital. Since then Yuzan&#x2019;s lived with her father and grandparents. Yuzan and I were only children, the only ones in our group. After her mother died, Yuzan started acting even more eccentric, even more like a guy. Terauchi said Yuzan must be a lesbian, but I couldn&#x2019;t really see it. Even if she were, I wouldn&#x2019;t know, I guess, because I wouldn&#x2019;t be her type. I switched the phone to my other hand and heard this sort of grabby sound as Terauchi came back on.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the story, dude.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, whatever&#x2014;but should I just ignore what&#x2019;s going on next door?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s their business, not yours. Don&#x2019;t you think so?&#x201d;<br><br>Terauchi&#x2019;s cool reply made me feel better. &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Well. I gotta go to cram school. Talk to you later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;See ya,&#x201d; she said, and hung up. I switched off the AC and checked my left eyebrow in the mirror again. I didn&#x2019;t like what I saw, but didn&#x2019;t have time to redo it, so I set off. I was wearing jeans and a black sleeveless shirt. A nothing sort of look, but something I felt comfortable in.<br><br>It was blindingly hot outside. I slipped on the new sandals I&#x2019;d bought at the bargain shoe store that was a two-minute walk from our house, and unlocked my bike, which I&#x2019;d left next to the front door. The handlebars and seat had baked in the sun and my hand sizzled when I touched them. Just then the front door of our neighbors&#x2019; house slammed shut and their front gate creaked open. Someone was coming out. Anxious, but curious, I turned around. It was Worm, dressed in jeans and a navy blue T-shirt. There was a tiny white Nike swoosh on the chest of his shirt. He was carrying a black backpack I remembered seeing before. Thank God. It wasn&#x2019;t a burglar after all. He&#x2019;d been at home. Relieved, I looked at him and our eyes locked. He looked happy and excited somehow, like he was going off on a date. That kind of look didn&#x2019;t suit him, and I quickly turned away. It was a strange feeling, like I&#x2019;d seen something I shouldn&#x2019;t have.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure is hot.&#x201d;<br><br>This was the first time he&#x2019;d even spoken to me. I nodded vaguely. So that&#x2019;s the kind of guy Worm is. The kind who talks about the weather&#x2014;and to somebody like me who&#x2019;s the same age. Humming a song, he squinted up at the sun. He looked so healthy that the nickname Worm no longer seemed right.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard some loud sound from your house a few minutes ago and it startled me.&#x201d; I had to say something.<br><br>Still squinting up at the sky, he tilted his head. &#x201c;Yeah? You must be mistaken.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Worm bounded off like he was heading off on a school outing. Embarrassed, I straddled my bike, shoved my bag into the front basket, and, without a glance backward, started pedaling toward the station. Soon I passed Worm, but I didn&#x2019;t say hi.<br><br>My cram school is near the south exit of a large station that connects up to the Chuo Line, four stops down the line from the station near my house. I was still thinking of Worm, actually about the sound I&#x2019;d heard next door, and I got snagged by one of those people with clipboards asking you to fill out questionnaires. I&#x2019;m usually careful enough to keep at least thirty yards between me and them, but this time I blew it. The questionnaire guy was dressed in a serious-looking outfit, white dress shirt and black pants, with the kind of black-framed glasses that are popular now.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you a student?&#x201d; he asked me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in a hurry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t take long. You&#x2019;re in college?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A four-year college or community college?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four-year. The education department at Tokyo University.&#x201d;<br><br>I stood there with this can&#x2019;t-be-bothered look on my face. The guy looked surprised for a second, then scribbled down &#x201c;Tokyo University&#x201d; in crappy handwriting. A sneer came to his face, like maybe he thought I was bragging. Or like he&#x2019;d seen through my lie.<br><br>&#x201c;May I ask your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ninna Hori.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you write it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hori is the character for &#x2018;moat,&#x2019; and Ninna is written the same as the <i>ninna</i> in the Ninna Temple in Kyoto.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Ninna Temple?&#x201d; the man muttered, and I used his moment of hesitation to make my escape. This was the first time I&#x2019;d said I was a Tokyo University student. Usually I tell people I&#x2019;m a secretary in an office, but with the crummy outfit I had on and my aggressive attitude, it seemed to fit. Whenever you have to write down your name and address for a questionnaire or member- ship form or at a store, it&#x2019;s best to use a phony name and address. Terauchi taught me that. The first time I did it I felt kind of nervous about lying, but after I&#x2019;d used the name for a while, Ninna Hori started to feel like a real second name. In our four-girl group all of us have a second fake name that we use when we rent a karaoke box. You have to be careful, Terauchi always warned us, or you&#x2019;ll wind up in some database. Then adults will <i>control</i> you.<br><br>The next person who tried to grab me was a creepy-looking woman. As I sped up to get away, the woman, eager for the chance to interview someone, rushed forward and almost tripped up. She had a mound of black hair, chopped off in a bowl cut, and no makeup. Her upper lip was dripping sweat. White sweat stains showed...</p><h2>Wild Bill Donovan: The Spymaster Who Created the OSS and Modern American Espionage</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Entertaining history...Donovan was a combination of bold innovator and imprudent rule bender, which made him not only a remarkable wartime leader but also an extraordinary figure in American history&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).</b><br><br>He was one of America&#x2019;s most exciting and secretive generals&#x2014;the man Franklin Roosevelt made his top spy in World War II. A mythic figure whose legacy is still intensely debated, &#x201c;Wild Bill&#x201d; Donovan was director of the Office of Strategic Services (the country&#x2019;s first national intelligence agency) and the father of today&#x2019;s CIA. Donovan introduced the nation to the dark arts of covert warfare on a scale it had never seen before. Now, veteran journalist Douglas Waller has mined government and private archives throughout the United States and England, drawn on thousands of pages of recently declassified documents, and interviewed scores of Donovan&#x2019;s relatives, friends, and associates to produce a riveting biography of one of the most powerful men in modern espionage.<br> <br> William Joseph Donovan&#x2019;s life was packed with personal drama. The son of poor Irish Catholic parents, he married into Protestant wealth and fought heroically in World War I, where he earned the nickname &#x201c;Wild Bill&#x201d; for his intense leadership and the Medal of Honor for his heroism. After the war he made millions as a Republican lawyer on Wall Street until FDR, a Democrat, tapped him to be his strategic intelligence chief. A charismatic leader, Donovan was revered by his secret agents. Yet at times he was reckless&#x2014;risking his life unnecessarily in war zones, engaging in extramarital affairs that became fodder for his political enemies&#x2014;and he endured heartbreaking tragedy when family members died at young ages.<br> <br> Wild Bill Donovan reads like an action-packed spy thriller, with stories of daring young men and women in his OSS sneaking behind enemy lines for sabotage, breaking into Washington embassies to steal secrets, plotting to topple Adolf Hitler, and suffering brutal torture or death when they were captured by the Gestapo. It is also a tale of political intrigue, of infighting at the highest levels of government, of powerful men pitted against one another. Donovan fought enemies at home as often as the Axis abroad. Generals in the Pentagon plotted against him.<br> <br> J. Edgar Hoover had FBI agents dig up dirt on him. Donovan stole secrets from the Soviets before the dawn of the Cold War and had intense battles with Winston Churchill and British spy chiefs over foreign turf. Separating fact from fiction, Waller investigates the successes and the occasional spectacular failures of Donovan&#x2019;s intelligence career.<br> <br> It makes for a gripping and revealing portrait of this most controversial spymaster.</p><p><b>Douglas Waller</b> is a former correspondent for <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Time</i>.

In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas -- namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.<p>In a bold new concluding chapter entitled "The End of the Worldly Philosophy?" Heilbroner reminds us that the word "end" refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today's increasingly "scientific" economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.</p>Robert L Heilbroner is the Norman Thomas Professor of Economics, Emeritus at the New School For Social Research, New York.

In Brother Ray, he tells his story in an inimitable and unsparing voice, from the chronicle of his musical development to his heroin addiction to his tangled romantic life. Overcoming poverty, blindness, the loss of his parents, and the pervasive racism of the era, Ray Charles was acclaimed worldwide as a genius by the age of thirty-two. By combining the influences of gospel, jazz, blues, and country music, he invented, almost single-handedly, what became known as soul. And throughout a career spanning more than a half century, Ray Charles remained in complete control of his life and his music, allowing nobody to tell him what he could and couldn't do.As the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> put it, <i>Brother Ray</i> is "candid, explicit, sometimes embarrassing, often hilarious, always warm, touching and deeply human-just like his music."</p><p><b>David Ritz</b> is the author of <i>Faith in Time: The Life of Jimmy Scott, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye</i>, and many other books with or about Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and B.B.

It is through our losses that we can transform ourselves and find new meaning in life.&#x201d; --<b>James Van Praagh</b><p><b>James Van Praagh</b>, who possesses the extraordinary ability to communicate with the heavenly realm beyond our physical world, has changed the lives of millions of people who have lost loved ones. Now, in a book destined to open pathways of hope and healing for millions more, the renowned medium and author of the New York Times bestsellers Talking to Heaven and Reaching to Heaven reveals how the devastating sorrow of a loss can lead to incredible opportunities for spiritual growth--and bring a sense of renewal and focus to our lives.</p><p>Van Praagh shares many insightful spiritual messages from deceased loved ones, who shed new light on grief and loss. These stories, along with accounts of his own personal experiences, assist us in viewing our losses as stepping-stones on our soul&#x2019;s evolving spiritual journey. In turn, we become aware of how we are connected to a larger universe, between the seen and unseen worlds. This deeply felt, wise, and compassionate book offers hope for a true healing of the mind and spirit, as we move beyond grief and loss--to a life of freedom, joy, and purpose.</p><p></p></p><p>World-renowned medium James Van Praagh (<i>Talking to Heaven</i>, <i>Reaching to Heaven</i>) says he has listened intensely for thousands of hours to "the subtle whispers between our earthly world and the finer etheric world of spirit." In writing this book on grieving, Van Praagh hopes to offer comfort and reassurance of eternal life, "so that you do not have to go through the rest of your days groping blindly in sorrow and pain," he explains. Yet Van Praagh also offers doses of his own hard-earned wisdom, keeping this guidebook firmly grounded in an earth-smart kind of reality.<p> <i>Healing Grief</i> is divided into four sections: The first part addresses "The Process," how humans cope with grief, including personal ruminations on the classic four stages. In part 2 Van Praagh speaks to "When Someone You Love Dies," offering specific essays on losing parents, grandparents, siblings, lovers, best friends. In part 3 he recognizes the numerous other losses that we grieve over--divorce, midlife crisis, losing a home or a job. In the final section Van Praagh speaks to reclaiming our lives, calling upon all that he believes of the after-life as well as listing specific rituals and activities that promote healing. Fans will appreciate his characteristically smooth writing style and the numerous fascinating anecdotes from his clients. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>James Van Praagh's first two books, both <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, have been a powerful healing force for millions of readers. Using his talents as a medium, Van Praagh has not only helped the bereaved reach their lost loved ones and find peace but he has also illuminated the mysteries of death, the afterlife, and rebirth. His new book, <i>Healing Grief</i>, will once again draw from his compelling and uplifting readings, but with a new and special purpose- to show what the spirit world can teach us about the grieving process itself.<br><br>While grief is clearly a natural response to death, it should also properly accompany life's other difficult passages, including times of transition, the loss of a relationship, or even the loss of a pet. <i>Healing Grief</i> begins with chapters that each examine a specific kind of loss - death of a parent, a spouse, or a child, the end of a marriage, or the onset of a troubling life change, such as unemployment or grave illness - and considers the particular bereavement issues it may engender. The book also offers advice on explaining death to children, on distinguishing healthy from destructive grief, and on harnessing the powers of healing through special exercises, meditation and affirmations. <i>Healing Grief</i> should be, in Van Praagh's words, "a manual for grieving well," offering an inspiring new perspective on grief from a world-renowned medium who has become an expert at helping people cope with unresolvable sorrow.</p><h2>A Baptist Preacher&#39;s Buddhist Teacher: How My Interfaith Journey with Daisaku Ikeda Made Me a Better Christian</h2><p>In this inspiring, soul-stirring memoir, Lawrence E. Carter Sr., founding dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, shares his remarkable quest to experience King's "beloved community" and his surprising discovery in mid-life that King's dream was being realized by the Japanese Buddhist philosopher and tireless peace worker Daisaku Ikeda. Coming of age on the cusp of the American Civil Rights Movement, Carter was personally mentored by Martin Luther King Jr. and followed in his footsteps, first to get an advanced degree in theology at Boston University and then to teach and train a new generation of activists and ministers at King's alma mater, Morehouse College. Over the years, however, Carter was disheartened to watch the radical cosmic vision at the heart of King's message gradually diluted and marginalized. He found himself in near despair&#x2014;until his remarkable encounter with the lay Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International and a life-changing meeting with Ikeda, its president. Carter knew that King had been inspired by Gandhi, a Hindu, and now Ikeda, a Buddhist, was showing him how King's message of justice, equality, and the fundamental dignity of life could be carried to millions of people around the world. What ensued was not a conversion but a conversation&#x2014;about the essential role of interfaith dialogue, the primacy of education, and the value of a living faith to create a human revolution and realize at last Martin Luther King's truest dream of a global world house.

The Lowcountry of South Carolina preened, the temperature in the seventies without a hint of the summer humidity that would arrive soon, the river shimmering with glints of sunlight captured in its crests, the blooms of the azaleas and gardenias competing for attention. The air was soft as cashmere.</p><p>For this very day much dreaming and planning had gone on behind the scenes, starting with the gown. Lena&#x2019;s cream-colored lace dress, originally worn by Aunt Rosalind forty years before, had been remade for Lena&#x2019;s taller body. Her ethereal and younger sister, Hallie, as the maid of honor, was adorned in a pale pink sheath dress with a circle of baby gardenias on her head, her straight blond hair falling to her shoulders. Lena&#x2019;s loose curls had been tamed for the day and pinned high under a pearl crown and a veil edged with tiny Swarovski crystals.</p><p>It was a small town, Watersend, South Carolina, nestled where the May River met the wide saltwater bay. The wedding was being held in the 1820s stone Episcopal church, full to overflowing. Although they weren&#x2019;t church members, everyone in town did favors for the Donohues, even the priest&#x2014;for Mr. Gavin Donohue, to be specific. Lena watched from the bride&#x2019;s room window as outside the guests arrived in pairs and clusters. The ancient oak trees spread their gnarled limbs, offering shady protection, and sunlight filtering through the Spanish moss turning it to gossamer.</p><p>&#x201c;A mass migration,&#x201d; Lena said to her mother, Elizabeth, who was fastening the last of the satin buttons at the back of Lena&#x2019;s dress. &#x201c;I bet there&#x2019;s not one person left in town. If a stranger came through, it would look like a ghost town.&#x201d;</p><p>Elizabeth laughed, a sound as tiny as she was. &#x201c;Well, you know your dad. He can&#x2019;t help but invite everyone. If someone walks into the pub, he&#x2019;s all a-chatter about his oldest daughter getting married to that endearing Littleton fella, and then he&#x2019;s off inviting them. I gave up counting long ago. The Oyster Shack just decided to cook enough Lowcountry Boil to feed the entire town. It&#x2019;s a safe bet. &#x201c; She gazed off. &#x201c;Still not sure how they&#x2019;re all going to fit under that tent in our backyard, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s wonderful there are so many,&#x201d; Lena said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice that so many people will witness this promise. It makes it feel more true, more of a sacred commitment. Even if they are mostly here for Dad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They are here for you, too, honey. You and your dad: two peas; one pod.&#x201d;</p><p>Lena studied her mother&#x2019;s face as she&#x2019;d done all her remembered life, looking for a sign what was missing, a gap that she&#x2019;d always felt, wanting more and finding less. Was this closeness with her dad a source of pain for her mother? Or was Elizabeth merely stating the truth without subtext?</p><p>Elizabeth Donohue wore a blue lace dress that fell like waves around her slim body. She was impeccable in her appearance and mannerisms&#x2014;her Virginia aristocratic heritage surrounding her like a perpetual shine. Lena had never seen her mother unkempt. Even her cotton nightgowns were ironed and coordinated with her robes. Meanwhile, Lena had trouble finding matching shoes.</p><p>Everything to do with the wedding planning had been annoying to Lena and she&#x2019;d only endured it for her mother&#x2019;s sake&#x2014;trying to please a woman who&#x2019;d never had a real wedding. They all knew the story&#x2014;how her parents had agreed that the money they&#x2019;d spend on a wedding would go to opening the pub. The justice of the peace in Watersend had married them, Mother in the white dress she&#x2019;d worn to her high school prom, and Dad in a black suit with a cobalt-blue tie.</p><p>Lena hadn&#x2019;t wanted all the nuptial hoopla; she&#x2019;d merely wanted to say her vows in a simple dress, throw a huge party at her dad&#x2019;s pub, the Lark, where she&#x2019;d spent most of her life at his side, and then hurry on with their adventuresome life. She and Walter had so much planned&#x2014;children, creative work, travel and family gatherings&#x2014;and sitting through prim parties and opening gifts with dainty oohs and aahs had not been part of her dream.</p><p>Thank God for Hallie, who had not only helped Lena maintain her patience through months of cutesy-pie smiling, but also knew enough to organize the wedding events down to the last toast said and confetti tossed. Lena, her head perpetually in the clouds, as their mother was always reminding her, wouldn&#x2019;t have made it a week into the spreadsheets and budget calculations. Hallie, on the other hand, dove into the deepest end of this wedding planning pool and arranged every small and beautiful detail. And now it was time; Lena had paid her dues in composure and her wedding day was here.</p><p>Hallie and Lena had spent the morning lazing in their childhood tree house, staring over the May River just as they&#x2019;d done almost every Saturday of their early lives, and secretly during many midnight hours when their parents had believed they were asleep. When Mother had finally called them inside to have their hair and makeup done for the wedding, Lena had grasped Hallie&#x2019;s hands and declared, &#x201c;Nothing will change between us. I am here for you and you for me&#x2014;the Donohue girls forever even if my last name changes.&#x201d;</p><p>Hallie had cried, true-blue tears that wet her cheeks and rolled into the soft corners of her mouth. &#x201c;It will change&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be married while I can&#x2019;t keep a guy around for more than six months.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do not cry! You&#x2019;ll find your soul mate, too. I know it.&#x201d; Lena had pulled her sister close. &#x201c;And look at us. Some things will change, but not us, not you and me.&#x201d; And Lena had meant it; nothing, not even marriage, could separate her from her beloved sister.</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be able to meet me at midnight to stare at the stars, watch for the shooting one,&#x201d; Hallie said quietly. &#x201c;Not like before.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find new ways.&#x201d;</p><p>It was times like this when Lena would think how much younger Hallie really seemed&#x2014;not immature as much as na�ve. She&#x2019;d never dated anyone seriously for more than a few months, and her shy insecurity kept her from the wider world, even attending college at the local satellite of the University of South Carolina. Hallie was living at home and finding jobs as a wedding organizer and party planner. Why did Hallie ever need to go anywhere else? she asked when pushed on the subject. She had everything she wanted right there. So, yes, Lena&#x2019;s marriage was putting a bit of a strain on Hallie&#x2019;s life cocoon.</p><p>Outside the bridal room door, the organ reverberated with &#x201c;How Great Thou Art,&#x201d; one of three songs that the organist, a last-minute replacement, knew. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the third time she&#x2019;s played that song,&#x201d; Lena said to her mother. She leaned close to the mirror and once again checked her rosy lipstick. She didn&#x2019;t often wear makeup and her face looked dollish and plastic so she wiped some off just as the door burst open and her three bridesmaids entered bearing a contraband champagne bottle held high.</p><p>&#x201c;You ready?&#x201d; Kerry asked, her face especially bright and cheerful with too much blush and eye shadow. Count on her to sneak in the alcohol.</p><p>It was Sara who popped the cork and poured the bubbly into those plastic flutes that Lena so hated. They always cracked when she drank from them.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s save it for after,&#x201d; Margy said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t have a drunk bride.&#x201d;</p><p>Kerry made a dismissive sound. &#x201c;One small sip for everyone!&#x201d; She held her thumb and forefinger a hairbreadth apart and laughed.</p><p>Margy handed a flute with one splash of bubbly to Lena. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s cheer to a long and happy life with your great love.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To stellar sex and forever together,&#x201d; Sara said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sara,&#x201d; Lena said, and pointed to her mother with a laugh.</p><p>Sara pretended to whisper. &#x201c;Oh, no. Doesn&#x2019;t your mom know about sex?&#x201d;</p><p>Mother took the champagne bottle from Margy and poured herself a small amount into a real glass from the side table. No plastic for Elizabeth. &#x201c;Oh, that,&#x201d; she said with a wink. &#x201c;Our children arrived in pink and blue packages.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, enough,&#x201d; Margy said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s cheer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not without my little sister,&#x201d; Lena said. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Hallie?&#x201d;</p><p>No one answered, each glancing around.</p><p>&#x201c;Mother, do you know where she is?&#x201d; Lena asked, taking the champagne bottle and walking toward the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;Darling, I&#x2019;ve been in here with you the entire time.&#x201d; Mother stepped forward and attempted to take the bottle from Lena&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to spill that on your dress. You know how you are.&#x201d;</p><p>Yes, Lena did know how she was: klutzy. And how lovely of her mother to remind her at that moment.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get her.&#x201d; Kerry headed for the door, in such a rush she almost knocked over the plastic cross on the banquet.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Lena shook her head. &#x201c;Let me.&#x201d; Lena wanted to find her best friend, the other half of her heart. She opened the door to an empty hallway, breathing in the aroma of mildew and incense. The ancient stone walls offered the impression of being in a castle far away, a place she&#x2019;d never been. She took a few steps out and glanced left and right. &#x201c;Hallie?&#x201d;</p><p>Only &#x201c;How Great Thou Art&#x201d; answered her call until Mrs. Martin, Lena&#x2019;s second grade teacher, stepped out from the ladies&#x2019; room and gasped. &#x201c;Oh, my. Lena! You are so beautiful. Who knew you&#x2019;d turn into such a lovely young woman?&#x201d;</p><p>Lena laughed and smiled. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; One of the vagaries of living in a town you&#x2019;d never left was the danger that people&#x2019;s memories of you at your most awkward age might be revived at any moment. Lena and Walter had gone round and round about where to live and had decided to stay in Watersend. He was new in town and she didn&#x2019;t want to abandon her family&#x2014;a tight-knit group that both nourished and made each other nutty. His family had disbanded&#x2014;his word&#x2014;when he was nine years old and his parents had divorced. An only child, he was shuffled back and forth, here and there, without ever feeling at home anywhere. Until, he said, until he met the Donohue family. This was what he&#x2019;d been looking for, this kind of deep connection and family life, right alongside the kind of love that swept him away.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just love of family that made them stay in Watersend&#x2014;logic was also part of their decision. Walter was a builder who could work anywhere and what with the Donohue family connections he could thrive in town while also finding work in both Savannah thirty minutes away and Charleston two hours away. Lena&#x2019;s job as a writer for the local newspaper would be enough for her until she started getting bigger assignments with more important news sources, which she had faith would happen soon.</p><p>Walter. His name made Lena smile, the quiver of rightness in her chest quickening. That he&#x2019;d chosen her was still a surprise. Yes, they were getting married &#x201c;too quickly,&#x201d; having known each other just eight months&#x2014;six before he knelt on one knee and proposed, and two since they&#x2019;d begun planning the wedding, which was easy for Mother and Hallie to plan as just another backyard party. But love is love and this was love. It doesn&#x2019;t take long to plan a party in a place like Watersend, where the town is waiting at the ready for something just like this to happen, like the night sky waiting for the stars to appear.</p><p>Walter&#x2019;s distant&#x2014;both in geography and in emotional support&#x2014;parents argued about which of them would attend, so that, in the end, neither of them were present. His groomsmen equaled Lena&#x2019;s bridesmaids in number, and all of them he considered &#x201c;brothers.&#x201d; Lena measured them with unease as she&#x2019;d only met them the day before the wedding and found them both loud and annoying with their private jokes and vague assertions of Walter&#x2019;s partying past life. When Hallie had asked, &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Lena had told her, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t dictate love. You can&#x2019;t tell it when and when not to appear. You have to grab it when it comes&#x2014;such a rare and wonderful gift.&#x201d;</p><p>From the moment Lena had met Walter Littleton from Atlanta, Georgia, she&#x2019;d been adrift in feelings she&#x2019;d never felt before&#x2014;most strongly, the desire to share her life with someone else, with this particular someone else.</p><p>Lena was twenty-five years old, the age she&#x2019;d always told her little brother, Shane, and Hallie she would be when she married. When she and Walter had burst through the door of the pub to announce their engagement that January night, Shane had laughed and said, &#x201c;Right on time.&#x201d;</p><p>Now at the church, Lena&#x2019;s ballet slippers&#x2014;she&#x2019;d refused high heels, convinced that she would fall in them halfway down the aisle&#x2014;were smooth along the stone hallway as she looked for her sister.</p><p>The vestibule appeared ahead and Lena backed away. Legend and lore told that seeing Walter would be bad luck. She wanted to fully experience that moment&#x2014;the one when she walked down the aisle and Walter eyed her all aglow with the veil wafting behind. Lena wasn&#x2019;t traditional by any means, but some wedding mythology was ingrained in a girl&#x2019;s mind, so permanently and elementally etched into the psyche that even she couldn&#x2019;t resist.</p><p>She turned swiftly and lifted her skirts to walk back down the hallway to the bridal room. The organist had shifted to her second song&#x2014;&#x201c;Amazing Grace.&#x201d; The pew dwellers would be getting antsy. It was five past the hour.</p><p>Lena pulled open two wooden doors to spy two empty rooms before she opened a third one where two lovebirds were entangled in an embrace so tight that Lena smiled at love so evident on her wedding day. They were kissing, the woman&#x2019;s face lifted to the man&#x2019;s. His hand was in her hair, pulling her close. His other hand raised the skirt of her dress so that white silk panties flashed. Lena almost turned away in embarrassment for intruding on such an intimate moment, but something in the scene didn&#x2019;t allow denial. The man&#x2019;s lips traveled down the woman&#x2019;s neck, and the flower crown Lena had created with her sister the night before fell to the floor.</p><p>A tiny woman with blond hair in a pink dress and a man in a tuxedo.</p><p>He was Walter.</p><p>She was Hallie.</p><p>Lena&#x2019;s belly turned to fire, ignited by the truth of what she was seeing. There Lena stood, a walking clich�: the sister betrayed on her wedding day. If it weren&#x2019;t so stunning it would be laughable. It was the annihilation of everything Lena Donohue believed in: true love, her family&#x2019;s protection, and her sister&#x2019;s fidelity. It was death, so why was she still alive?</p><p>The champagne bottle shattered on the stone floor, a bombshell of splintered glass and fractured reality as she dropped it in shocked pain. All that had seemed real was illusion; all solid ground fell away; all love dissolved into treachery. Only one pure thought exploded through her mind&#x2014;This is the end of everything good.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The past is never just the past.</p><p>David Whyte, Consolations</p><p>Colleen stood at the window with the disconnected phone still in her hand.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not Dad.</p><p>Her brother had hun...</p></p><h2>Dogsbody</h2><p><b>A funny, heartbreaking, stunning book by the legendary Diana Wynne Jones&#x2014;with&nbsp;an introduction by Neil Gaiman.</b><br><br>The Dog Star, Sirius, is tried - and found guilty - by his heavenly peers for a murder he did not commit. His sentence: to live on the planet Earth until he can carry out a seemingly impossible mission - the recovery of a deadly weapon known as the Zoi. The first lesson Sirius learns in his lowly earthly form is that humans have all the power. The second is that even though his young mistress loves him, she can't protect either of them. The third - and worst - is that someone out there will do anything to keep Sirius from finding the Zoi. Even if it means destroying Earth itself. This funny, heartbreaking, stunning book features an introduction by Neil Gaiman, an avid fan of Diana Wynne Jones.</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones was the multiple award-winning author of many fantasy novels for children, teenagers, and adults. Her book <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> was made into an Academy Award-nominated major animated feature by Hayao Miyazaki. She received the World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.

A young Jedi is discovered. A dormant evil rises again, New truths are found. Bestselling author Patricia C. Wrede brings to life the epic story of &#34;Star Wars: Episode I,&#34; in a stunning novel sure to captivate legions of readers.</p><p>Much-loved YA author Patricia Wrede (<i>Dealing with Dragons</i>, <i>Calling on Dragons</i>) retells here the storyline of <i>Episode I, The Phantom Menace</i> from opening shot to final scene. Since much of the action in <i>Phantom Menace</i> centers on 14-year-old Queen Amidala and 9-year-old Jedi-to-be Anakin Skywalker, Wrede takes the opportunity to focus on the thoughts and struggles of these two scrappy youngsters. And young <i>Star Wars</i> fans will appreciate that Wrede's adaptation is faithful to the screenplay--the events and dialogue mesh seamlessly with memories from the movie, only complementing the action with added details and inner dialogue.

At eighteen, she has returned from boarding school-smart as a whip, feisty, and irredeemably unromantic-determined to throw over her education and join the "stern men"working the lobster boats. Gilbert utterly captures the American spirit through an unforgettable heroine who is destined for greatness-and love-despite herself in this the critically acclaimed debut.</p><p>John Irving <i>wishes</i>. That he could be as mordantly funny as Elizabeth Gilbert, that is. With the publication of her first novel, <i>Stern Men</i>, Gilbert has been widely compared to New England's unofficial novelist laureate. And the comparison is a natural; this writer gives us a tough, lovable heroine against an iconoclastic, rural backdrop. Ruth Thomas grows up on Fort Niles Island, off the coast of Maine, among lobstermen, lobster boats, and, well, lobsters. There's just not much out there besides ocean. Abandoned by her mother, she lives sometimes with her dad and sometimes with her beautiful neighbor, Mrs. Pommeroy, and the seven idiot Pommeroy boys. Eventually she is plucked from obscurity by the wealthy Ellises--vacationers on Fort Niles for some hundred years--and sent, against her will, to a fancy boarding school in Delaware. (Sorting out her relationship with this highly manipulative family is one of the novel's crooked joys.) Now she has returned, and is casting about for something to do. <p> What Ruth does (hang around with her eccentric island friends, fall in love, organize the lobstermen) makes for an engaging book that's all the more charming for its rather lumpy, slow-paced plotting. Gilbert delivers a kind of delicious ethnography of lobster-fishing culture, if such a thing is possible, as well as a love story and a bildungsroman. But best of all, she possesses an ear for the ridiculous ways people communicate. One of Mrs. Pommeroy's young sons, "in addition to having the local habit of not pronouncing <i>r</i> at the end of a word--could not say any word that started with <i>r</i>.... What's more, for a long time everyone on Fort Niles Island imitated him. Over the whole spread of the island, you could hear the great strong fishermen complaining that they had to mend their <i>wopes</i> or fix their <i>wigging</i> or buy a new short-wave <i>wadio</i>."</p><p> The beauty of Gilbert's book is that she gives us an isolated rural culture, and refuses to settle for finding humor in its backwardness. Instead she gives us a community of uneducated but razor-sharp wits, and produces an impressive comic debut. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><b>Elizabeth Gilbert</b> is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of <i>Big Magic</i>, <i>Eat Pray Love</i>, and <i>The Signature of All Things</i>,<i> </i>as well as several other internationally bestselling books of fiction and nonfiction.

At the height of a distinguished career as a &#x201c;bone-hunter&#x201d; and paleontologist, Eiseley turned from fieldwork and scientific publication to the personal essay in six remarkable books that are masterpieces of prose style. Weaving together anecdote, philosophical reflection, and keen observation with the soul and skill of a poet, Eiseley offers a brilliant, companionable introduction to the sciences, paving the way for writers like Carl Sagan, Stephen Jay Gould, and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Now for the first time, the Library of America presents his landmark essay collections in a definitive two-volume set.<br><br>Beginning with the surprise million-copy seller <b>The Immense Journey</b> (1957), Eiseley produced an astonishing succession of books that won acclaim both as science and as art.

Eiseley&#x2019;s subjects are wide-ranging, curious, and meticulously realized: the role of flowering plants in evolution; a disturbing insect, seen in childhood; the questions raised by a new&nbsp;fossil; a forgotten episode in the history of science.

Dressed in a navy blue trench coat and white Nikes, the woman introduces herself as "Mary. Mother of God.... You know. Mary." Instead of a golden robe or a crown, she arrives bearing a practical wheeled suitcase. Weary after two thousand years of adoration and petition, Mary is looking for a little R &amp; R. She's asked in for lunch, and decides to stay a week. As the story of their visit unfolds, so does the story of Mary-one of the most complex and powerful female figures of our time-and her changing image in culture, art, history, as well as the thousands of recorded sightings that have placed her everywhere from a privet hedge to the dented bumper of a Camaro.<br><br>As this Everywoman and Mary become friends, their conversations, both profound and intimate, touch upon Mary's significance and enduring relevance. Told with humor and grace, <b>Our Lady of the Lost and Found</b> is an absorbing tour through Mary's history and a thoughtful meditation on spirituality, our need for faith, and our desire to believe in something larger than ourselves.</p><p>Diane Schoemperlen is the author of <b>Our Lady of the Lost and Found</b>; <b>In the Language of Love</b>; and five short story collections, including <b>Forms of Devotion</b>, which won the Governor General's Award for Fiction in 1998; and <b>The Man of My Dreams</b>, which was nominated for a Governor General's Award and a Trillium Award.Signs<p>Looking back on it now, I can see there were signs. In the week before it happened, there was a string of unusual events that I noticed but did not recognize. Seemingly trivial, apparently unconnected, they were not even events really, so much as odd occurrences, whimsical coincidences, amusing quirks of nature or fate. It is only now, in retrospect, that I can see them for what they were: eclectic clues, humble omens, whispered heralds of the approach of the miraculous.</p><p>These were nothing like the signs so often reported by other people who have had similar experiences. The sun did not pulsate, spin, dance, or radiate all the colors of the rainbow. There were no rainbows. There were no claps of thunder and no bolts, balls, or sheets of lightning. There were no clouds filled with gold and silver stars. The moon did not split in two, the earth did not tremble, and the rivers did not flow backward. A mil-lion rose petals did not fall from the sky and ten thousand blue butterflies did not flock around my head. There were no doves. There were no advance armies of angels. There was not even one angel, unless you care to count the squirrel.</p><p>Three mornings in a row a fat black squirrel with one white ear came and balanced on the flower box at my kitchen window. It was the middle of April. There was nothing in the box but last year's dirt, hard-packed and dense with the ingrown roots of flowers long-gone to the compost pile. It would soon be time to refill them with fresh soil and plant the annuals: impatiens, lobelia, some hanging vines.</p><p>The squirrel appeared on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, each morning at seven o'clock. I sat at the kitchen table in my nightgown and housecoat, drinking coffee and reading The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende for the second time. I had read it when it first came out a dozen years before, and had picked it off the shelf again on impulse, without wondering why it suddenly seemed important to read it again. I was enjoying it even more the second time around. The squirrel sat on the edge of the window box nibbling on something that looked suspiciously like a tulip bulb from the flower bed below.</p><p>I realize there is nothing intrinsically unusual about a squirrel on a window box eating a tulip bulb. What piqued my interest was that white ear. The squirrel looked in at me with its head cocked as if listening hard with its white right ear. We stared at each other. The squirrel kept eating and listening. Even when I leaned closer to the window and made ferocious faces and carnivorous sounds, the squirrel stayed put, twitching its fluffy tail like a flag.</p><p>On each of those three mornings, the squirrel sat at my window for exactly half an hour and then it scampered away.</p><p>On the fourth morning, I got up early, got dressed, and waited. I am no more sure now than I was then of what I intended to do if and when the squirrel appeared. Feed it, kill it, or tame it and keep it for a pet? Chase it away with the broom, invite it in for coffee, or simply sit and stare into its beady eyes some more?</p><p>I waited and waited but the squirrel never came. I went outside and repaired the damage to my flower bed. I came back inside and began my day again just as if nothing had happened. Because, of course, nothing had.</p><p>That day, Thursday, turned out to be what I now think of as The Day of Mechanical Miracles.</p><p>The kitchen faucet, which had been dripping for a year and half, stopped.</p><p>The toaster, which for a month had been refusing to spit out the toast (thereby necessitating its extraction by means of a dangerous operation with a fork), repented. That morning the toast popped up so perky and golden, it fairly leaped onto my plate.</p><p>The grandfather clock in the living room, which I had bought on impulse at an auction six years before and which had not kept good time since, became accurate and articulate, tolling out the hours with melodious precision.</p><p>The answering machine, which had been recording my callers as if they were gargling underwater or bellowing into a high wind, recovered its equanimity and broadcast my new messages into the room in cheerful, dulcet tones.</p><p>I, of course, marveled extensively at these small miracles but had no reason to suspect they were anything but fortuitous gifts meant perhaps to finally prove my theory that if you just leave things alone and let them rest, they will eventually fix themselves. I had no reason to suspect that these incidents of spontaneous repair might be products or premonitions of the divine. These self-generated mechanical healings were just as likely, I thought, to be the ultimate and inevitable culmination of such modern innovations as self-cleaning ovens, self-defrosting refrigerators, self-sealing fuel tanks, and self-rising bread.</p><p>The next day, Friday, I had several errands to run. I was hardly surprised to discover that my car, which had lately been suffering from some mysterious malady that caused it to buck and wheeze whenever I shifted into second gear, had quietly healed itself during the night, and it now carried me clear across town without complaint. There were parking spaces everywhere I needed them, some with time still on the meter.</p><p>At the bank, I got the friendliest, most efficient teller after a wait of less than five minutes. On a Friday afternoon, no less. While I waited, I noticed that all three of the women in line in front of me were wearing navy blue trench coats and white running shoes.</p><p>At the library, all the books I wanted were in and shelved in their proper places.</p><p>At the bakery, I got the last loaf of cheese bread.</p><p>At the drugstore, all the things I needed-toothpaste, shampoo, bubble bath, and vitamins-were on sale.</p><p>On the way home, I stopped at the corner store for a quart of milk and a chocolate bar. The clerk behind the cash register was new, a young woman with long brown hair and dark dreamy eyes. She was sipping coffee out of a Styrofoam cup and reading The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende. The clerk who was usually there at this time of day would have been doing her nails and reading the National Enquirer. There was no one else in the store. There was no one choosing a dollar's worth of penny candy one candy at a time; no one trying to cash a check; no one buying forty-seven Scratch-and-Win tickets and then feeling obliged to scratch them all right there. Feeling gregarious in my good fortune, I asked the clerk how she was enjoying the book. She said it was wonderful. I agreed wholeheartedly and mentioned that by coincidence I was reading it too. She said that was amazing.</p><p>At home I put away my purchases, ate my chocolate bar, and thanked my lucky stars. Still it did not occur to me that there might be anything more going on here than a random bout of serendipity at work in my life. We have all had weeks where everything went wrong. So why not a week where everything went right? As far as I was concerned, I deserved a day or two of smooth sailing through the hazardous waters of daily life. Undoubtedly this was my just reward for having so often weathered the more familiar barrage of everyday ordeals.</p><p>I thought of all those times I had finally reached a cranky, incompetent bank teller after waiting in line for half an hour wedged between a crying baby and an unwashed man who had recently eaten a large clove of garlic, only to have her put up her next teller sign or inform me that my checking account was overdrawn by $2,486.99. And what about all those times when every book I wanted to borrow from the library was either already out, lost, or stolen? How many times had the bakery run out of cheese bread three minutes before I got there? How many times had I searched that same drugstore for my favorite health and hygiene products only to find that they were temporarily out of stock, permanently discontinued, or twice as expensive as they had been six weeks ago? How many times had the only available parking spot within a four-block radius been whisked right out from under my wheels by a more aggressive (and remorseless) driver in a hulking black minivan? And how many times had I been so overjoyed to finally find a parking spot that I had walked away without putting money in the meter and so got ticketed the minute my back was turned?</p><p>Obviously I deserved a good day and I was not about to question either its meaning or its message.</p><p>On Saturday morning, I did my regular rounds of vacuuming, dusting, dishes, and laundry. In the afternoon, I got groceries. Then I decided to clean out my bedroom closet. It was spring, after all, and some extra cleaning seemed appropriate. Once a year I sort the contents of my closet into three piles: Keep, Give Away, and Back Bedroom, the closet in the back bedroom being the way station between Keep and Give Away, the place where I put all those things that I know I will never wear again but that I'm not quite ready to part with either. After a respectable period of time in Back Bedroom limbo, these items, too, eventually find their way out the door. This time the Back Bedroom pile included a pair of flowered cotton drawstring pants that made me look fat, an expensive olive green blouse that made me look sallow, a short purple skirt that made me look ridiculous, and a chocolate brown cardigan that made me feel dowdy and depressed every time I looked at it.</p><p>As I hung these items in the otherwise empty back bedroom closet, I caught sight of a small cardboard box wedged into the far right corner of the top shelf. I could not imagine what it contained. I couldn't reach it, so I dragged a chair in from the kitchen, climbed up on it, and lifted down the box. On the top was a yellowed mailing label, addressed in my mother's handwriting to an apartment I had lived in nineteen years ago. The label and several lengths of brittle cellophane tape came off in my hands. I thought briefly of Pandora's box, all those eager evils let loose upon the unsuspecting world.</p><p>Inside the box was another box, of a color somewhere between robin's egg and sky blue, with a gold insignia embossed on the lid. Inside the blue box, in a nest of cotton batting, was my old charm bracelet.</p><p>I had begged for and got this bracelet from my parents on my fifteenth birthday. It came with one silver charm already soldered on: a round Happy Birthday with my name and the date engraved in italic script on the back. Over the following years, the charms accumulated one by one. Most were gifts from my parents, on Christmas, other birthdays, Valentine's Day, high school graduation. There was a Christmas tree studded with tiny red and green stones and, from another year, a miniature Christmas stocking with multicolored gems the size of pinheads bursting out the top. There were charms that said Sweet Sixteen, Always Eighteen, Congratulations, and Good Luck. There was a diploma, a typewriter, and a bicycle.</p><p>By the end of high school, all my friends sported similar bracelets heavy with charms. We jingled through the high school hallways, laughing, gossiping, and watching for handsome football players out of the eagle-eyed corners of our eyes. As we pulled lunch bags, gym shoes, and battered textbooks from our lockers, the charms sometimes caught in our sweaters, our nylons, or each other's hair. They were the amulets of all our hopes and dreams, the untarnished talismans of our promising futures, our expectant selves.</p><p>Looking at them now, I found a few that seemed to have nothing to do with me: an airplane, a horse, a treble clef, a tiny ball of wool pierced by two crossed needles. As if the charms from someone else's bracelet had somehow detached themselves and migrated to mine. Or maybe it was just that at the time anything was possible. I might fly to Mexico, France, or Kathmandu. I might learn to ride a horse. I might learn to play the harp, the trumpet, the mandolin. I might compose a symphony. I might knit up the raveled sleeve of care.</p><p>When I moved away from home at the age of twenty-one, I left the bracelet behind on purpose, having decided in my fledgling maturity that it was childish, tacky, and cheap. My mother, discovering it still there in my jewelry box after I'd left, assumed I'd forgotten it by mistake, and promptly mailed it to me.</p><p>I had given the bracelet up for lost a long time ago. Having mellowed somewhat over the years, no longer feeling the need to guard so vigilantly against the seductions of nostalgia or regret, I had looked for it several times but without success. I figured it had been accidentally left behind somewhere in one of the many moves I'd made since that first one.</p><p>But now here it was in my hands. How had I not seen that little box on the top shelf all the other times I had used this closet? Why did I not remember putting it up there in the first place?</p><p>I could not answer either of these questions. I am not a careless person. I never forget appointments, birthdays, letters to be answered, or phone calls to be returned. I have never lost my keys, my wallet, or my gloves. I once left my favorite scarf on a train but that was an aberration brought on by my own travel anxiety. Until this day, I would have sworn that I could close my eyes and conjure up the contents of every single closet in my house, also the junk drawer, the spice cabinet, and the laundry hamper.</p><p>At first, my discovery made me uneasy but then I began to feel exhilarated, wondering what other unexpected treasures might show up, what other mislaid pieces of my self might eventually be unearthed and reclaimed.</p><p>I put on the bracelet and wore it for the rest of the day. At bedtime, I put it back in the blue box. Then I put the box in my top dresser drawer beside my socks and underwear where I would not lose track of it again.</p><p>On Sunday, after six days of bright spring weather, it rained, just the kind of gentle, steady rain you want in April, the kind of rain you know really will bring those alleged May flowers.</p><p>We were enjoying an early spring that year. Since Easter, which had also been early, falling at the end of March, the temperature had been steadily rising and the snow had long since melted away. Other years in April, there were still gray patches of it under trees and in shady corners, and we were still being warned by the weather forecasters to expect one more big storm before winter was done with us. But that year, April was not the cruelest month, the forsythia and the crocuses were blooming, the tulips were in bud, and we had put away our shovels with confidence and relief. I had already raked the lawns and cleaned out the flower beds, delighted to be digging in the dirt once again.</p><p>The day passed quietly. Nothing unusual happened until later in the evening. I had put on my nightgown and housecoat and curled up on the couch to watch the ten o'clock news.

Those warnings went mostly unheeded; now, he insists, we need to acknowledge that we&#x2019;ve waited too long, and that massive change is not only unavoidable but already under way. Our old familiar globe is suddenly melting, drying, acidifying, flooding, and burning in ways that no human has ever seen. We&#x2019;ve created, in very short order, a new planet, still recognizable but fundamentally different. We may as well call it Eaarth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>That new planet is filled with new binds and traps. A changing world costs large sums to defend &#x2014; think of the money that went to repair New Orleans, or the trillions of dollars it will take to transform our energy systems. But the endless economic growth that could underwrite such largesse depends on the stable planet we&#x2019;ve managed to damage and degrade. We can&#x2019;t rely on old habits any longer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Our hope depends, McKibben argues, on scaling back &#x2014; on building the kind of societies and economies that can hunker down, concentrate on essentials, and create the type of community (in the neighborhood, but also on the Internet) that will allow us to weather trouble on an unprecedented scale. Change &#x2014; fundamental change &#x2014; is our best hope on a planet suddenly and violently out of balance.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2010</strong>: Since he first heralded our era of environmental collapse in 1989's <i>The End of Nature</i>, Bill McKibben has raised a series of eloquent alarms. In <i>Eaarth</i>, he leads readers to the devastatingly comprehensive conclusion that we no longer inhabit the world in which we've flourished for most of human history: we've passed the tipping point for dramatic climate change, and even if we could stop emissions yesterday, our world will keep warming, triggering more extreme storms, droughts, and other erratic catastrophes, for centuries to come. This is not just our grandchildren's problem, or our children's--we're living through the effects of climate change now, and it's time for us to get creative about our survival. McKibben pulls no punches, and swaths of this book can feel bleak, but his dry wit and pragmatic optimism refuse to yield to despair. Focusing our attention on inspiring communities of "functional independence" arising around the world, he offers galvanizing possibilities for keeping our humanity intact as the world we've known breaks down. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i><br> <br> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Conversation Between Curt Stager and Bill McKibben</strong><br> <br> <p><b>Curt Stager is the author of <i>Deep Future: The Next 100,000 Years of Life on Earth</i>.</b></p><p></p><b></b> <p><b>Bill McKibben</b>: How'd you come to worry about this global warming stuff in the first place?</p> <p><b>Curt Stager</b>: When your book, <i>The End of Nature</i>, first came out, I already knew about global warming but wasn't very worried about it yet. I'm a paleoclimatologist, so I was used to thinking about huge climatic changes of the distant past, and I also wasn't convinced by what was then the available evidence that humans are driving most of today's trend. But now so many excellent studies clearly demonstrate our central role in the warming of the last 30-40 years that I've moved on from "is it really happening" mode to "what does it mean" and "what can we do about it?" Another factor was a project that you asked me to do in support of one of your articles several years ago - to study the weather records in our home region in and around northern New York and Vermont. The latest data show that much of this area is actually warming faster than the global average, and ice stays on our lakes two weeks less in an average winter than it did a century ago. Because of all this, I suppose you could say that I'm a "reformed climate skeptic" now.</p> <p><b>Bill McKibben</b>: What kind of timescales do we need to be thinking on to really understand what's happening?</p> <p><b>Curt Stager</b>: We've got to expand our view of this issue a thousand-fold to really grasp it. According to the latest research, much of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide we release during our lifetimes will linger in the air not just for centuries but for tens of thousands of years, long enough to affect future ice ages.</p> <p><b>Curt Stager</b>: <i>Eaarth</i> is one of the most amazing book titles I've ever seen; in a single word it beautifully captures the essence of what you're trying to tell us about our influences on the planet. How did you come by it?</p> <p><b>Bill McKibben</b>: Well, I wanted a way to get across the idea that we're already living on an altered planet. Not as altered as it's going to be, but--for people my age, the iconic image of our planet was that first photo back from the Apollo spacecraft. And the world does not look like that any more. A lot less white up top! Somehow we have to figure out how to get the message across that global warming is not a problem for the future, it's a desperate crisis already.</p> <p><b>Bill McKibben</b>: Scientists are forever struggling to communicate effectively with the general public. You're a whiz at it, as this book, and your work in places like National Geographic, make clear. What advice would you give your colleagues?</p> <p><b>Curt Stager</b>: That's a fine compliment coming from a master wordsmith like yourself, but it's particularly nice to hear in my case because when I first started my scientific career, back in the 1980s, communicating with the public was openly frowned upon. Nowadays I'm glad to see that it's much more widely accepted, even encouraged, and there are many great opportunities for scientists to be trained in such things. I was fortunate enough to attend a public communications workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation, for example. But don't be fooled, you science types; there's a lot more to writing effectively for the public than you may think. When it's done properly it appears smooth and natural, but that's not because it's easy; it's a sign of skill and effort. Pay this craft the respect it deserves and learn from people who know what they're doing, then go out and really earn your grants by letting us all know how you spent our tax dollars!</p> <p><b>Curt Stager</b>: You do a good job of keeping up with the latest developments in climate research even though you're not a professional scientist. Do you have any advice in that regard for non-science types who are trying to wade through the information jungle in search of current, reliable information about climate change?</p> <p><b>Bill McKibben</b>: Like any other huge field, you need some guides--picking someone like Jim Hansen who's been right again and again seems like a good strategy. You need to keep abreast of the important science as it develops. And you need to find some journalists who have paid attention for a long time: Bryan Walsh at <i>Time</i>, Andy Revkin at the <i>New York Times</i>, and so forth. But the trick is not to be too caught up in the details, and keep your eye on the main current: the debate about whether we're warming the planet is no longer interesting. What's interesting is what we're going to do about it.</p><b>Bill McKibben</b> is the author of <i>Eaarth</i>, <i>The End of Nature</i>, <i>Deep Economy</i>, <i>Enough</i>, <i>Fight Global Warming Now</i>, <i>The Bill McKibben Reader</i>, and numerous other books.

All Rights Reserved.<p> There have been many changes in the field of early intervention since the first edition of <b>The Carolina Curriculum for Handicapped Infants and Infants at Risk</b> (Johnson-Martin, Jens, &amp; Attermeier) was published in 1986. Following the enactment of the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986 (PL 99-457), there was a dramatic expansion of early intervention services in the United States of America. We have progressed from having widely scattered services focused exclusively on the child to having programs in every state that focus on the child as part of a family unit and from having only a few therapists trained to work with young children with special needs to having a variety of personnel specifically educated and trained to work with this population and their families. There are now special educators, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and nutritionists who are specialists in early intervention. Moreover, these professionals have learned to work together, not only sharing information and expertise but also allowing the boundaries between their roles to blur as appropriate. There has been a shift from professionals providing services primarily in center-based programs to providing services in homes, child care centers, and preschools. Professionals now form partnerships with parents, child care providers, and teachers to develop and implement intervention activities within the daily routines of the children they serve.</p><p> At the time the first <b>Carolina Curriculum</b> was developed, the field urgently needed materials for children functioning in the birth to 24-month range and for children with significant disabilities who could not be expected to develop evenly across all developmental domains. Thus, that curriculum focused on the birth to 24-month developmental period and tried to accommodate uneven developmental patterns by dividing the skills included in the five basic domains of development (personal-social, cognition, communication, fine motor, and gross motor) into 24 sequences of skills, arranged in an order that promoted building a new skill on the foundation of previously learned skills.</p><p> The acceptance of <b>The Carolina Curriculum for Handicapped Infants and Infants at Risk</b> encouraged the authors to develop a companion volume, <b>The Carolina Curriculum for Preschoolers With Special Needs</b> (CCPSN; Johnson-Martin, Attermeier, &amp; Hacker, 1990), directed toward children in the 24- to 60-month developmental range. An attempt to integrate the infant and preschool curricula was made when the infant curriculum was revised in 1991 (<b>The Carolina Curriculum for Infants and Toddlers with Special Needs, Second Edition [CCITSN];</b> Johnson-Martin, Jens, Attermeier, &amp; Hacker). However, interventionists found it difficult to use either curriculum efficiently with children whose skills were scattered between the two volumes.</p><p> This revision of the CCITSN and its companion volume, the second edition of the CCPSN, are designed to provide a guide for working with children who have special needs from birth to 60 months. The infant and toddler curriculum now includes items that cover developmental skills from birth to 36 months, whereas the preschool curriculum includes items to cover developmental skills from 24 to 60 months. The sequence and the item names are identical in both volumes for the 24- to 36-month range so that interventionists can move smoothly from one curriculum to the other.</p><p><b>WHAT IS THE CCITSN APPROACH?</b></p><p> This edition, like previous editions of the CCITSN, links assessment to intervention through hierarchies of developmental tasks that are both relevant to typical routines for young children and pertinent to long-term adaptation&#x2014;an approach described as "authentic" by Bagnato, Neisworth, and Munson (1997). That is, the intervention is integrated in a meaningful way into the child's life. Because each item on the assessment tool is linked directly to a curriculum item that describes procedures for teaching the assessed skill, readers have a framework for moving smoothly from assessment to intervention. This edition includes the following characteristics:</p><p></p><ol><li>The curriculum is based on typical sequences of development but does not assume that a child will develop at the same rate across domains or even within one domain (e.g., a child may exhibit typical cognitive development along with very delayed motor development, a child may have age-appropriate grammatical structures but have significantly delayed vocabulary). Thus, the curriculum is designed for you to use both with the child who is developing slowly but in a typical pattern and with the child whose pattern of development is markedly atypical due to one or more impairments.</li><li>The curriculum approaches atypical development in two ways. First, the items in each developmental domain are subdivided into logical teaching sequences (i.e., a sequence in which item order is primarily determined by how one skill builds on another, not only by the mean age levels at which typical children learn the skills). Second, general modifications of the items in each developmental domain are suggested so that you can accommodate a child's particular sensory or motor limitations. Thus, a child with severely delayed motor abilities but potentially average cognitive skills is not held up in progressing through the cognitive domain because he or she cannot do items that require typical motor skills. </li><li>The curriculum is based on the recognition that many infants and toddlers with serious impairments will never develop typically in spite of intervention efforts. Thus, in treating these children, you must consider teaching atypical but highly adaptive skills that may temporarily or permanently replace typical skills. For example, should a child be unable to talk, it is appropriate for you to teach pointing or another indicator response that will allow him or her to make choices, communicate wishes, and so forth. </li><li>Although the curriculum is developmental, with items drawn from standard developmental assessment tools, clinical experience, and the observations of Jean Piaget, behavioral theory and methodology underlie item construction. There is also a strong emphasis on developing adaptive functional skills, even if these are not necessarily typical (e.g., moving by scooting on one's buttocks or using a scooter board when crawling would be typical but is not functional). </li></ol><b>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE CCITSN?</b><p> The CCITSN has been designed to provide a systematic approach for developing intervention plans for children with special needs who are functioning within the birth to 36-month developmental range. In this curriculum, you will find</p><p></p><ul><li> A criterion-referenced assessment for determining the child's mastery of important social, cognitive, language, motor, and adaptive skills</li><li> Suggestions for selecting educational objectives from the assessment</li><li> Guidelines for developing activities for the individualized family service plan (IFSP) that incorporate the educational objectives</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Oxford Anthology of Western Music: Volume 1: The Earliest Notations to the Early-Eighteenth Century</h2><p>Designed to complement chapters 1-10 of <em>The Oxford History of Western Music</em>, College Edition, Second Edition.<br><br><strong>Package and save!</strong><br>Print and recorded volumes from the <em>Oxford Anthology of Western Music</em> can be bundled with Richard Taruskin and Christopher H.

We are part of a community engaged in a vast conversation, but we deny our role in it."<br><br>In the face of climate change, species loss, and vast environmental destruction, the ability to stand in the flow of the great conversation of all creatures and the earth can feel utterly lost to the human race. But Belden C. Lane suggests that it can and must be recovered, not only for the sake of endangered species and the well-being of at-risk communities, but for the survival of the world itself. <br><br><em>The Great Conversation</em> is Lane's multi-faceted treatise on a spiritually centered environmentalism. At the core is a belief in the power of the natural world to act as teacher. In a series of personal anecdotes, Lane pairs his own experiences in the wild with the writings of saints and sages from a wide range of religious traditions. A night in a Missourian cave brings to mind the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola; the canyons of southern Utah elicit a response from the Chinese philosopher Laozi; 500,000 migrating sandhill cranes rest in Nebraska and evoke the Sufi poet Farid ud-Din Attar. With each chapter, the humility of spiritual masters through the ages melds with the author's encounters with natural teachers to offer guidance for entering once more into a conversation with the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Belden C.

Sociocracy means governance by those who associate together. This book is based on the Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method (SCM) developed in the Netherlands by electrical engineer Gerard Endenburg, based on earlier work of educator Kees Boeke. Many Voices One Song includes step-by-step descriptions for structuring organizations, making decisions, and generating feedback. The content is illustrated by many diagrams, tables, examples, lists, skits, and stories from the field. The book includes a glossary and index, and an appendix summarizing processes in easily reproducible form. The book covers four major areas: Sociocratic organizational structures based on linked teams (circles) that distribute authority from the top of organizations to the most frontline teams that are appropriate. These teams are linked by both top-down leaders and bottom-up delegates to ensure that influence and power are shared in a circular rather than linear hierarchy. Organizational diagrams illustrate different ways to structure organizations in an egalitarian way. Decision making by consent, defined as no one having an objection to a proposed decision. Consent is a participatory and inclusive approach to decision making, in contrast to win-lose voting and most forms of consensus. Decision-making steps (understand-explore-decide) detailed include proposal generation and the proposal to consent decision-making process. The book also outlines the steps for selection of people to roles in open dialog processes. The insights of compassionate communication (Nonviolent Communication/NVC) are integrated into the context of decision making. Meeting format and design, including facilitation skills and processes that ensure that all voices matter in decision making.Feedback processes for evaluating the effectiveness of meetings, policies, workflows, and role performance support an ongoing learning cycle and continuous improvement, not just in production and delivery but in the embodiment of equality itself. The intent of this book is to contribute to the spread of sociocracy by making information available. Egalitarian self-governance needs to be simple enough so everyone can share power in a healthy way.</p></p><p><ul> <li><p><strong>"Finally a handbook for Sociocracy!

However, this first book of an epic fantasy series is not accessible; it reads like a later volume of a complicated ongoing series. Author R. Scott Bakker has created a world that is very different from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, yet in depth of development comes closer than most high-fantasy worlds. In addition to providing five appendices, Bakker attempts to make his complex world clear to readers by filling the prologue and opening chapters with the names of characters, gods, cities, tribes, nations, religions, factions, and sorcerous schools. For many readers, this approach will have the opposite effect of clarity. It's like demonstrating snowflake structure with a blizzard. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>R.

Willebeek Le Mair. </p><b>That Odd Mary Magdalene<br></b> <br>It seems that even among Jesus&#x2019; disciples, Mary played a privileged role. Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>Watching The English</h2><p>Convinced that there is such a thing as Englishness, the popular anthropologist Kate Fox looks beyond the the ethnographic dazzle of superficial differences to reveal the unwritten rules that define English national identity and character.

It describes the origin of the Eurocentric global order, which Schmitt dates from the discovery of the New World, discusses its specific character and its contribution to civilization, analyzes the reasons for its decline at the end of the 19th century, and concludes with prospects for a new world order. It is a reasoned, yet passionate argument in defense of the European achievement - not only in creating the first truly global order of international law, but also in limiting war to conflicts among sovereign states, which, in effect, civilized war. In Schmitt's view, the European sovereign state was the greatest achievement of Occidental rationalism; in becoming the principal agency of secularization, the European state created the modern age. Since the problematic of a new <i>nomos</i> of the earth has become still more critical with the onset of the post-modern age and post-modern war, Schmitt's text is even more timely and challenging. <p>Remarkable in Schmitt's discussion of the European epoch of world history is the role played by the New World, which ultimately replaced the Old World as the center of the earth and became the arbiter in European and world politics. According to Schmitt, the United States' internal conflicts between economic presence and political absence, between isolationism and interventionism, are global problems, which today continue to hamper the creation of a new world order. But however critical Schmitt is of American actions at the turn of the 20th century and after World War I, he considered the United States to be the only political entity capable of resolving the crisis of global order.</p></p><p>Carl Schmitt (1888-1985) is one of the greatest German legal and political thinkers of the 20th century. Most of his fame stems from works published during the 1920s, e.g., <i>Political Romanticism</i> (1919), his study of dictatorship (<i>Die Diktatur</i>, 1922), <i>Political Theology</i> (1922), <i>The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy</i> (1923), his critical analysis of the Weimar Constitution (<i>Verfassungslehre</i>, 1928), and writings in which he attempted to save the Weimar Republic (<i>Der Hueter der Verfassung</i>, 1931, and <i>Legalitaet und Legitimitaet</i>, 1932). He is best known for <i>The Concept of the Political</i> (1927 and 1932), where he dealt with the state's loss of its monopoly of politics, and argued that the essence of the political lies in the distinction between friend and enemy. Less known are Schmitt's works written during the 1930s and 1940s, among them his consideration of three types of juridical thinking (<i>Ueber die drei Arten des rechtswissenschaftlichen Denkens</i>, 1934), <i>The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes</i> (1938), his analysis of the concept of <i>Grossraum</i> in international law, based on the Monroe Doctrine (<i>Voelkerrechtliche Grossraumordnung mit Interventionsverbot fuer raumfremde Maechte</i>,1939), and <i>The</i> Nomos <i>of the Earth</i> (1950). Later works, such as <i>Theory of the Partisan</i> (1963), which analyzed the emergence of a new type of warfare based around non-state actors, have become increasingly relevant in the age of global terrorism.</p><h2>Rules for Vanishing</h2><p><b>In the faux-documentary style of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> comes the campfire story of a missing girl, a vengeful ghost, and the girl who is determined to find her sister--at all costs.</b><br><br>Once a year, a road appears in the forest.

People cluster around their phones, as if by reading the text again, comparing the identical messages, they might reveal some new clue about who sent them.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Sara! Do you want to play the game?&#x201d; Tyler Martinez asks, lunging toward me as I walk inside, the first bell ringing. He waggles his eyebrows at me and swings away, laughing at his own joke. I cross my arms over my ribs and lean forward, as if pushing against a current.</p><p>Whispers of<i> Lucy</i> are everywhere. And <i>the game</i>. People in clots, heads leaned together.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve timed things so that I arrive just before the bell, and the hallway is emptying out as the threat of tardy slips overwhelms the urge to gossip. A few stragglers give me odd looks. Odder than usual.<i>I bet she sent it</i>, I imagine them whispering.<i> She&#x2019;s </i>obsessed<i>.</i></p><p>The game. Lucy Gallows. And Wednesday is the anniversary. It doesn&#x2019;t take a genius. I&#x2019;d probably blame me, too.</p><p>I slide into first period and take my seat, as close to the back corner as I can get.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey. Sara.&#x201d; Trina sits at the group table in front of mine, and she has to twist around in her seat and lean to talk to me. Her blue eyes are piercing in their exquisite concern, her blonde hair swept up in a casual ponytail that looks more glamorous than anything I&#x2019;ve managed since the days when she would sit behind me for hours, coercing my mousy hair into french braids and fishtails. &#x201c;How are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I mutter. I can&#x2019;t look her in the eye. Her expression is too painfully sympathetic. It would be one thing if it was a performance, but it&#x2019;s genuine. And it&#x2019;s there every time she looks at me, like she&#x2019;s worried that I&#x2019;m going to crumple under the strain of my personal tragedies at any moment.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you did it,&#x201d; she says, leaning closer. Which means that people are already saying that I did.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>She nods slowly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let anyone give you crap for it,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you suggest I stop them?&#x201d; I ask. She flinches back a little, but she&#x2019;s spared the need to answer by the second bell, marking the beginning of class. She straightens in her seat. I slouch down as Mr. Vincent launches into his daily preamble, complete with the terrible joke he inflicts on us every day.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;and he says, &#x2018;Me? I&#x2019;m a giant heavy metal fan.&#x2019;&#x201d; He wraps up just as the door opens. Anthony Beck steps into the room to the sound of groans, and slaps a hand to his forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;I missed the joke of the day?&#x201d; he asks in exaggerated despair. He flashes a smile, his dimples deep, his brown eyes bright and half-hidden by his wavy black hair. Back when we were younger, when we were friends, he was skinny as a rail, all elbows and knees, his smile too big for his body. The last year or two he&#x2019;s started to add muscle, and the nerd who&#x2019;d tripped over his own feet is co-captain of the lacrosse and soccer teams, an athletic scholarship waiting for him at Northeastern. He got his ear pierced over break, and the silver stud winks.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you have a good reason for missing out on my effervescent wit,&#x201d; Mr. Vincent says.</p><p>&#x201c;It took me all morning to text the entire school. My thumbs are cramping like you wouldn&#x2019;t believe,&#x201d; Anthony says with a joker&#x2019;s grin. &#x201c;Sorry, Mr. V. Won&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201d; His gaze roves around the room, and his grin wobbles a moment when he sees me. We&#x2019;re assigned to the same small group for our current project, which means we&#x2019;ve been sitting together for the past couple of weeks, but we&#x2019;ve managed not to exchange more than a dozen words. He&#x2019;s been responsible for eleven of them.</p><p>He slings himself into the chair beside me. It&#x2019;s much too cramped for his tall frame, and I shrink farther back into the corner, away from him. Mr. Vincent shakes his head.</p><p>Anthony sneaks a glance at me. I duck over my notebook, trying to ignore him. It isn&#x2019;t easy.</p><p>Anthony Beck and Trina Jeffries used to be two of my best friends. There were six of us&#x2014;seven when we let Trina&#x2019;s little brother, Kyle, hang out&#x2014;a roving gang of miscreants who stuck together from first grade until high school. We even had a stupid group name. The Wildcats. It was the Unicorn Wildcats until fifth grade, a compromise that Trina had worked out when the vote was split down the middle&#x2014;my sister, Becca, and I on opposite sides of the debate, as usual. I was pulling for the Unicorns, of course. Back then my aesthetic was 70 percent glitter, before the severe color allergy I developed in middle school. Becca, though? She was fierce from the start.</p><p>We all linked hands, crossing our arms to grab the person on the opposite side, and shook on it.<i>We are the Unicorn Wildcats. Friends forever and ever. No matter what.</i></p><p>To a bunch of first graders, it felt like an unbreakable bond. Forever felt possible. It felt inevitable. But now Becca is gone, and I haven&#x2019;t spoken to any of them about more than the Cold War or sine and cosine for almost a year.</p><p>Mr. Vincent is starting to outline the day&#x2019;s agenda when a hand shoots up in the second row. He pauses, rhythm disrupted. The corner of his mouth tightens, but that&#x2019;s the only sign of irritation. &#x201c;Vanessa. If you need help with your current project, we can talk during check-in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about my w-work,&#x201d; Vanessa says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about the t-t-text message we all g-got.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I saw that. And obviously, it&#x2019;s intriguing,&#x201d; Mr. Vincent says. He settles back against his desk. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure how it&#x2019;s relevant to the Industrial Revolution.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s r-relevant to history. Local history,&#x201d; Vanessa says, pushing her round glasses up her nose.</p><p>From my angle I can only see the curve of her cheek and the back of her head, but like most of the people in the room, I&#x2019;ve known Vanessa Han since kindergarten, and I can imagine the familiar expression of intense interest she must have fixed on Mr. Vincent. She wears thick-framed glasses and leggings with wild, colorful patterns, a look both bold and self-assuredly nerdy, much like Vanessa herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Local history,&#x201d; Mr. Vincent echoes. &#x201c;You mean the reference to Lucy? Meaning Lucy Gallows.&#x201d; He rubs his chin. &#x201c;All right. It has nothing to do with nineteenth-century methods of production and their impact on the idea of the nuclear family, but what the hell. All right, who can tell me the story of Lucy Gallows?&#x201d;</p><p>Half a dozen hands go up. He points. Jenny Stewart speaks up first. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she, like, this girl from a hundred years ago? Her brother killed her and buried her body in the woods, and now the woods are haunted.&#x201d;</p><p>Vanessa gives her a withering look. &#x201c;Th-that&#x2019;s not&#x2014;&#x201d; The next word tangles itself up in her mouth, and she falls silent for a beat before continuing in a firm, steady tone. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s an interesting thought,&#x201d; Mr. Vincent says. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s true, and what isn&#x2019;t? And how do we determine the difference? Let&#x2019;s set aside the supernatural for the moment. Whether or not there&#x2019;s a ghost in the woods of Briar Glen, it&#x2019;s part of local legend, and it must have come from somewhere. So was that somewhere a complete fiction, concocted by some creative soul and embellished over the years? Or does it have a seed of truth?&#x201d;</p><p>I shut my eyes. No one knows what <i>really</i> happened to her. Which is probably why she&#x2019;s stuck around in the town&#x2019;s memory for so long.</p><p>&#x201c;Sara.&#x201d;</p><p>My eyes snap open. Mr. Vincent is looking at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Last semester, when we were doing the project on assessing unusual historical sources, you used the legend of Lucy Gallows for your paper, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; My mouth is dry. I lick my lips. I was hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t remember. Not that anyone is likely to have forgotten, when I spent months burying myself in stories of Lucy and making no attempt to hide it. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;And what did you find out?&#x201d;</p><p>All eyes are on me, heads swiveling, bodies turning in their cramped seats. Except for Anthony, looking off into the distance conspicuously. Trina catches my eye and smiles a little, encouraging. I clear my throat. If there&#x2019;s anyone left who doesn&#x2019;t suspect me already, they will now. &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t a girl named Lucy Gallows. But there was a girl named Lucy Callow, and she did go missing in the forest,&#x201d; I say haltingly.</p><p>&#x201c;And her ghost kidnapped your sister, right?&#x201d; Jeremy Polk says. Attention snaps to him. Anthony makes a sound in the back of his throat a little like a growl, glaring daggers at his best friend and co-captain. Jeremy&#x2019;s smile flicks off like a light. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he mutters.</p><p>&#x201c;What the fuck, Jeremy?&#x201d; Anthony says.</p><p>Mr. Vincent pushes off from the desk, his voice pitched low and level. &#x201c;Jeremy, I know that you&#x2019;re aware that&#x2019;s an inappropriate comment. We&#x2019;ll talk about it after class. And, Anthony? Let&#x2019;s all try to keep things civil.&#x201d;</p><p>Jeremy ducks his head, muttering another apology and rubbing his neck just under where one of his hearing aids sits, a habit he&#x2019;s had as long as I&#x2019;ve known him. My heart pounds in my chest, my mouth dry as the surface of Mars.<i>Do you want to know where Lucy went?</i></p><p>Yes.</p><p>Because Becca went there, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Sara is right,&#x201d; Mr. Vincent says, redirecting with hardly a hitch. &#x201c;Lucy Callow was fifteen in April of 1953, when she went missing. The name change came later, as the ghost story evolved. In cases like this, it&#x2019;s important to go back to official, contemporary records as much as possible. With Lucy Callow, there&#x2019;s still a great deal we don&#x2019;t know, but many of the popular stories are easily disproved. But even if those stories aren&#x2019;t factually true, they can help teach us about the people who told them. What was important to them, what scared them. Ghost stories are a vibrant, essential part of local culture.&#x201d;</p><p>He keeps going, prompting students to supply other ghost stories and urban legends, coming up with ideas for how to track down their origins.</p><p>I hardly hear it. All I hear are the last words my sister spoke, muttering into her phone. On April 18, one year ago.</p><p><i>We know where the road is. We&#x2019;ve got the keys. That&#x2019;s all we need to find her. I&#x2019;m not backing down now. Not after everything we&#x2019;ve done to get this close.</i></p><p>And then she turned and saw me. Slammed her bedroom door closed.</p><p>The next morning she was gone, and she never came home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EXHIBIT B</p><p><i>&#x201c;The Legend of Lucy Gallows&#x201d;</i></p><p>Excerpted from <i>Local Lore: Stories of Briar Glen</i> by Jason Sweet</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a Sunday&#x2014;April 19, 1953&#x2014;and Lucy Gallows&#x2019;s sister was getting married on a sprawling property at the edge of the Briar Glen Woods. Little Lucy, age twelve, was the flower girl. But following an argument with her mother, she ran away into the woods in her crisp white dress with its blue ribbon around the waist. Everyone expected she&#x2019;d be back in a minute or two, as soon as she calmed down, but ten minutes later she hadn&#x2019;t returned&#x2014;and then twenty minutes, and then half an hour.</p><p>Lucy&#x2019;s brother, Billy, was sent to fetch his sister. He walked into the woods. The only way forward was a narrow track, a deer trail through the trees. He called her name&#x2014;<i>Lucy! Lucy!</i>&#x2014;but received no answer except the calling of crows.</p><p>And then he saw it: the road. There were roads here and there in the woods, the remnants of the original settlement of Briar Glen, which had burned down in 1863. These roads were now often nothing more than a stretch of trees planted in too straight a line to spring from nature, or one stone pressed up against another where all the rest had long since been knocked astray. At first this road was like that, a dimple in the underbrush and a few scattered stones marked with the tools of men. But as Billy chased it, the road widened, and the stones knocked up against each other, beginning to form a smooth path through the thick forest.</p><p>He was certain that Lucy had followed the road, though he couldn&#x2019;t explain the strength of the conviction to anyone who had asked afterward. And yet for all that conviction, every step he took seemed to be more difficult than the one before. As the road grew easier, his way grew harder, as if he was laboring against an invisible force.</p><p>His feet got heavier and heavier. The air seemed to push against him. It became almost unbearable, and then&#x2014;there was Lucy. He could see her ahead of him, around a slight bend in the road. She was talking to someone&#x2014;a man in a patchy brown suit and a wide-brimmed hat. Billy called her name. She didn&#x2019;t turn. The man bent slightly to talk to her, smiling. He put out his hand.</p><p>Billy screamed his sister&#x2019;s name and thrashed toward her. But Lucy didn&#x2019;t seem to hear him. She took the stranger&#x2019;s hand, and together they walked down the road. They moved swiftly, not burdened as Billy was, and the road seemed to follow, vanishing beneath Billy&#x2019;s feet. In moments the road and the man and little Lucy Gallows were gone.</p><p>Townspeople searched the woods for weeks, but no sign of Lucy was ever found. But every so often, someone stumbles across the road, winding through the woods, and sees a girl running down it, dressed in a white dress with a blue ribbon. You can never catch up with her, they say, and you will find yourself alone in the bewildering woods, with no sign of a road or a girl or a clear way home.</p><p>So be careful what roads you take, and be careful who you follow down them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>INTERVIEW</p><p><i>SARA DONOGHUE</i></p><p>May 9, 2017</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sara Donoghue sits in the interview room.

An avid baseball fan, Tye now runs a Boston-based training program for medical journalists. He is the author of <i>The Father of Spin, Home Lands,</i> and<i> Rising from the Rails </i>and co-author, with Kitty Dukakis, of Shock. He lives in Lexington, Massachusetts.<i>Chapter One<br>Coming Alive</i><br><br>&#x201c;I was no different from any other kid, <br><br>only in Mobile I was a nigger kid.&#x201d;<br><br>Satchel Paige entered the world as Leroy Robert Page. He was delivered at home into the hands of a midwife, which was more help than most poor families could afford in 1906 in Mobile, Alabama. His mother, Lula, was a washerwoman who already spent her nights worrying how to feed and sustain the four daughters and two sons who had come before. Five more would follow. Leroy&#x2019;s father, John, alternated between the luxuriant lilies in the gardens he tended uptown and the corner stoops on which he liked to loiter, rarely making time to care for his expanding brood. With skin the shade of chestnut and a birthplace in the heartland of the former Confederacy, the newborn&#x2019;s prospects looked woeful. They were about to get worse.<br><br>The hurricane that battered Mobile Bay just two months after Leroy&#x2019;s birth started with two days of torrential rains carried in on the back of a driving northeast wind. By the next morning ten-foot-high surges had dispatched oyster and fishing vessels to the bottom of the sea. Tornado-like squalls ripped from their roots southern pines, blew tin roofs off Greek Revival homes, and made it look as if birds were flying backward. At historic Christ Church only the choir loft was left standing. The lucky escaped by fleeing to third-floor attics or climbing tall trees; 150 others were consigned to watery graves. One area hit especially hard was the Negro slum known as Down the Bay, where the Pages lived.<br><br>Their home was a four-room shack called a shotgun, because a shot fired through the front door would exit straight out the back. That is the path storm waters took when they burst through Down the Bay&#x2019;s alleys on the way to more fashionable quarters. Rental units like the Pages&#x2019; were ramshackle and fragile, with no flood walls to protect them from the nearby sea and no electricity to ease their recovery. The Page cottage remained standing but the thin mattresses the children shared and their few furnishings needed airing out. That cleanup would have to wait: Lula&#x2019;s white employers insisted she be at their homes early the next morning to mop up the storm damage. The kids would wait, too, the way they did every day when Mama headed to work, with the older ones watching over baby Leroy and the rest of the young ones.<br><br>Leroy&#x2019;s world was being reshaped in another way that would mark him even more profoundly. Mobile historically was a center of the slave trade and the destination for the last slave ship to America, but Alabama&#x2019;s oldest city also was home to more than a thousand blacks who bought or were granted their freedom in the antebellum era. That paradox was consistent with the coastal city&#x2019;s push toward the conservative state of which it was part and its pull to a more tolerant world beyond its shores. For more than two hundred years Mobile had welcomed outsiders&#x2014;Irish Catholics fleeing the famine, Jewish merchants, Yankees and English, along with legions of Creoles, the free offspring of French or Spanish fathers and chattel mothers&#x2014;and they in turn challenged inbred thinking on everything from politics to race. The result, during the Reconstruction period, was a blurring of color lines in ways unthinkable in Montgomery, Selma, and most of the rest of Alabama. Jim Crow&#x2014;the system of segregation named after a cowering slave in an 1820s minstrel show&#x2014;was there in Mobile, but so was Booker T. Washington&#x2019;s gospel of black self-help. The races were separated on trolleys and in other public settings, but the separation was done by tradition more than law. Blacks not only could vote for officeholders, a few even held political office. Paternalism more than meanness defined how whites treated Mobile&#x2019;s 18,000 black citizens.<br><br>Unfortunately for Leroy, that live-and-let-live mind-set had begun fraying by the turn of the century and it unraveled entirely the very season of his birth. The reforms of Reconstruction were collapsing across the South, as whites who wielded power in the fallen Confederacy began to reinvent the realm and tear down Negroes&#x2019; new freedoms. The brief postwar honeymoon of racial coexistence survived longer in Mobile than in most of the South, but the backlash finally came there, too. An ordinance mandated separate seating on streetcars. Blacks were barred from most restaurants, cemeteries, saloons, hotels, and brothels. Whites and blacks were not allowed to attend the same school, marry one another, or live together. And in the wake of the devastating September hurricane, Mobile&#x2019;s most influential newspaper stirred up reader resentment with its account of Negroes looting the homes of dead Caucasians and mutilating their bodies.<br><br>The rising tensions turned violent on October 6, 1906, when two black men accused in separate rapes of young white girls were being transported by train back to Mobile from protective custody in Birmingham. Forty-five vigilantes with masks and rifles boarded the train, took custody of the accused, and hanged them from a tree in the community of Plateau, just north of Mobile. As word of the killings spread, three thousand spectators, many arriving by streetcar, paraded by the black men&#x2019;s limp bodies. Some snapped photographs. Others stole bits of the prisoners&#x2019; garments and cut souvenir segments from their noose. The double lynching ushered in four years of racist mobocracy in Mobile County. In 1907 Moses Dorsett, a Negro accused of raping an elderly white woman, was seized by a white mob and strung up fifty yards from the 1906 gallows. Two years later masked men snatched from the county jail a black inmate charged with killing a sheriff&#x2019;s deputy, hanging the wounded man from an oak tree across from Mobile&#x2019;s oldest church. This lynching stripped away any pretense that mob actions were confined to rural areas or resisted by law enforcers. It happened in the heart of the city, two blocks from the main police station, and investigators later established that the jail had been left unlocked.<br><br>Lest anyone doubt their meaning, the lynchers left behind notes. &#x201c;Negroes must be taught that death will always follow attacks on white women,&#x201d; one warned, while another advised, &#x201c;There [are] plenty of ropes and trees left.&#x201d; Blacks did not need the reminders. Many church and lay leaders from the Negro community had already gone, heading north or to larger cities in the South. Between 1910 and 1920, blacks&#x2019; share of Mobile&#x2019;s population fell from 44 to 39 percent. While most had to stay, increasingly the city seemed less an oasis and more like the rest of Dixie. The Ku Klux Klan operated freely. Negroes disappeared from public offices and from voting rolls. In commerce, blacks were supplicants, whites selective benefactors. Less than two generations after the end of two centuries of slavery, liberation looked less like freedom than serfdom.<br><br>Leroy Page was too young to understand those developments but they were reinforced every day he spent in his native city. While record keepers used Colored to denote the city&#x2019;s dark-skinned residents, the label used by most whites started with n. Those first few years &#x201c;I was no different from any other kid,&#x201d; Leroy wrote half a century on, &#x201c;only in Mobile I was a nigger kid. I went around with the back of my shirt torn, a pair of dirty diapers or raggedy pieces of trousers covering me. Shoes? They was someplace else.&#x201d; At a too-young age, he added, &#x201c;I found out what it was like to be a Negro in Mobile.&#x201d;<br><br>Lula and John had always known. John Page was at least a second-generation Mobilian. While he was born fourteen years after what many southern whites called the War of Northern Aggression, and he lived through the more hopeful years of Reconstruction, his ancestors almost certainly were dragooned in Africa and brought to America in shackles. John wed Lula when he was seventeen and began married life as a day laborer, which meant hoping he would be hired by white home owners or contractors for jobs ranging from hauling trash to laying bricks. Later he turned to gardening, although he preferred to be called a landscaper. Unemployed landscaper would have been more accurate. His kids saw less of him than they wanted and needed. Lula loved him but knew not to count on him or to argue with him when he was drinking. Still, she was proud that he never laid a hand on her.<br><br>Lula Coleman Page was almost four years older than her husband and would outlive him by more than forty years. As inattentive as John was, Lula was a present and steady figure in Leroy&#x2019;s young life and those of his siblings. She raised and supported them. She taught them when to yield to their harsh surroundings and when to fight. She gave Leroy the love he seldom felt from his father and the certainty he could count on her. None of that was easy given how many other children she had asking for those same things. And none of it was done explicitly; she showed the way through her own struggle to get by.<br><br>Lula was pregnant close to half the time over a twenty-two-year stretch starting in September of 1894, nearly two years before she married John. Ellen was her first child, and like the rest she was delivered at home with no thought of a high-priced doctor or hospital. Three years later came Ruth, and the year after that John Jr. Julia was Lula&#x2019;s first baby in the new century; she celebrated by naming the child after her mother, who was born a slave and was one of their few ancestors whose stories were passed on to Leroy and his siblings. There were two more children&#x2014;Wilson and Emma Lee&#x2014;before Leroy Robert made his entry in 1906. He had five younger siblings: the twins, Palestine and Eugene, then Clarence, another Lula, and, in 1917, the twelfth and last, Inez.<br><br>That averages out to a baby every twenty-two months, which made it a challenge to keep track of who was who in the family. Leroy himself often failed to include Eugene when he listed his brothers and sisters, either because there were so many of them or because Eugene died at birth. There was confusion every time U.S. Census takers visited the Page household, with ages and other answers not quite dovetailing with the children&#x2019;s birth certificates. Some discrepancies were legitimate, given that Lula could not read or write, add or subtract. Others seemed whimsical. She forgot not just when her acclaimed son Leroy was born but where he fit in the birth order. Discretion might have been the motivation when John and Lula&#x2019;s marriage was described as predating rather than following Ellen&#x2019;s birth. Leroy, who got from Lula more than he acknowledged of his wit and his aphorisms, did credit her for one illuminating maxim: &#x201c;If you tell a lie, always rehearse it. If it don&#x2019;t sound good to you, it won&#x2019;t sound good to anybody else.&#x201d;<br><br>Being full-time mother to her eleven surviving children should have been more than a full-time job, but Lula could not afford the indulgence. John did not earn nearly enough to feed all those babies, so Lula took jobs she variously described as washerwoman, laundress, and domestic. All amounted to the same things: scrubbing spotless the homes of wealthy white families; using blue bleach along with red-hot water to clean their clothes, a smoothing iron to remove wrinkles from blouses and dresses, and starch to firm up shirt collars; and helping with the cooking. Later, when her own children were older, she sometimes took home the washing and ironing, setting up a boiling pot and rubbing board in the front yard.<br><br>Domestic labor like that must have reminded Lula of her mother&#x2019;s life during slavery. The plantation was in many ways a simpler society, with clearer rules and relationships. In Lula&#x2019;s day, even work as uncontroversial as a maid&#x2019;s could raise racial hackles. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why Mobile people shouldn&#x2019;t have three meals a day, as they do in other cities all over the country,&#x201d; a white woman complained to the Mobile Register in a 1912 article on the &#x201c;servant problem.&#x201d; &#x201c;As it is, we have to beg the cook to give us two meals a day, and at night everybody has to eat scraps. Between meals, we have no servant to answer the door bell and the telephone. I think that all servants should be employed for a full day&#x2019;s work.&#x201d; Black leaders rallied to the white cause, vowing to set up training programs to clarify the duties as well as set the wages of domestics and bring the &#x201c;best class of servants in touch with the best class of employers.&#x201d;<br><br>Lula&#x2019;s wages of fifty cents a day helped feed her brood. Leroy never missed a meal, although it was more likely to be cereal, greens, and water than chicken, beef, or milk. Lula stood at the head of the table ladling out each spoonful to the dozen or so bowls set in front of her. When there was not money enough for store food the boys were sent down to the bay where the fish were always biting. &#x201c;It was poverty-stricken living,&#x201d; Leroy would say later, &#x201c;before I knew what that meant.&#x201d;<br><br>What he and his siblings did know by the age of six was that they had to pitch in. They also understood where, as young Negroes, they could safely work or play. Bienville Square, Mobile&#x2019;s oldest public park with its gnarled oaks and iron fountain, was off-limits. So were the choicest beaches along the gulf, seats near the front of streetcars, and any public accommodation that was not labeled &#x201c;Colored.&#x201d; Everyone knew which days of the week the Sisters of Charity dispensary cared for Negroes and which were whites only. It was okay for black boys to walk or play in back alleys or on city streets, espe- cially those south of magnolia-shaded Government Street. Librarians winked at the strictures of segregation; police and judges did not. Guessing wrong could land a sepia-skinned adolescent in the lockup or even the morgue. Asking whether a racial reform tried elsewhere might work here drew this refrain: &#x201c;This is Mobile and we don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d; Before long no one bothered to ask.<br><br>Leroy worked the alleyways like a pro, collecting and cashing in empty bottles he found there. A half-pint could fetch a penny; four cents for a quart. Delivering ice, a valued commodity in steamy Mobile, also brought in small change. Leroy was springing up like a weed in a bog, and as he grew so did Lula&#x2019;s and John&#x2019;s expectations of his earning power. The obvious place to look for work was the nearby L&amp;N Station, where five separate railroads provided passenger service. Rail depots were a bonanza for Negroes back then. Black redcaps hoisted trunks onto and off the trains. Black Pullman porters served as chambermaids and shoe shines, nursemaids and valets. Black chefs and waiters offered seatside service of sugar-cured ham, Welsh rarebit, and 131 other culinary delights fit for New York&#x2019;s finest eateries, while black firemen shoveled wood and coal to feed forever-hungry locomotives. And black youths like Leroy jumped when wealthy white travelers snapped their fingers in the air, polishing their boots or carrying bags to hotels like Mobile&#x2019;s luxurious Battle House for as little as a dime or as much as a quarter.<br><br>Leroy was the quickest among the pint-size porters, but he soon realized that he could not bring home a real day&#x2019;s pay if he made just ten cents at a time. So he got a pole and some rope and jury-rigged a contraption that let him sling together two, three, or four satchels and cart them all at once.

Jon Benjamin</b> is an actor, voice actor, and stand-up comedian. He lives in New York.Chapter 1<br><br>The Early Failure Years (or How I Failed to Have a Name)<br><br>I was born in a hospital. I was told that my mother was given nitrous oxide for the birth. As in, she was totally sedated. The whole labor, totally out of it. My father used to say it was used for the conception as well. Just kidding, he never said that. I just wanted to make a salty joke and blame it on my father. Anyway, they used strange methods back in the sixties. Maybe her sedation affected me. I do feel dizzy all the time, and I'm incredibly lazy, which might have all been connected to not having heard the agonized screams of my mother as I came into the world. Just entering the universe to a really quiet room, but for the nasal mutterings of a Jewish obstetrician complaining to a nurse about the cost of his landscaper, can have a lasting effect on one's personality.<br><br>The place of my birth was Worcester, Massachusetts. Worcester isn't known for its good hospitals, so I imagine I was mishandled. I don't have any visible signs of that, except for two huge indentions in my skull. I assume forceps were used. I read once that the name Elliot became popular in the late nineteenth century because that was the name of the forceps used in childbirth: the Elliot forceps. Can you imagine naming your child after the steel instrument that pulled them out of your vagina? That shows a real lack of due diligence. When you name your child after a medical device, it is a pretty telltale sign of an unhappy marriage. Not many women naming their kids Eppy today, after the epidural. Just saying. Also, that will be the last time I will write "just saying," based on how I cringed after writing it.<br><br>I was named Harry Jon Benjamin. Harry after my paternal grandfather and Jon after the misspelling of John. It appears that there was some discord over my name, so an untidy agreement was made between my parents where they would maintain my first name on the birth certificate but call me by my middle name.<br><br>The Harry has always been a buried secret, like an identity Easter egg, and that mystery has had its own odd effects as well, probably due to the fact that my dad's father died at a really young age, so passing on his name would be like passing on a curse. But they still gave it anyway, with the caveat of deciding to never utter it. So, as a result, I am just subtly cursed by the ghosts of my ancestry. It's a very Jewish tendency to honor and excise the past simultaneously. (Jewish voice) "He's named after his grandfather, God rest his soul, a name that will never ever be uttered in this house, God forbid!" That's what's in my name. A real Jewish cocktail of guilt, pride, and necrophobia.<br><br>Still, Jon is a pretty solid mainstream name, so I could blend in, until teachers read out the spelling. It's never fun to get made fun of for the fact your name is spelled wrong. Like, "Your mom's so dumb, she spelled John wrong." Or "How dare you sully the memory of John the Baptist, who baptized Jesus and whose head was cut clean off by King Herod just 'cause his vindictive daughter asked him to!" Anyway, no one is ever completely scarred by a name, except for, maybe, that guy named Tiny Ichicock.<br><br>My earliest memories are of my parents cleaning. My father owned an electrical supply store that sold lighting and bulbs and circuit breakers, etc., so as a family, we had access to a lot of cutting-edge electrical equipment. You know how in the fifties, there was a rush to be the first home on the block to purchase a TV set? It was momentous, a real sea change for families. That "moment" came for us in the form of the NuTone Central Vacuum System. Because of my father's position, we were definitely the first home in our neighborhood to install the vac system, which held the promise of changing everything for home cleaning. It was basically a network of ports in the wall of any room that could connect a vacuum hose to a central unit in the basement. A comprehensive cleaning system, like the 2001: A Space Odyssey of vacuum systems. A real Valhalla for compulsive cleaners.<br><br>And shit, did they use it. In my memory, most of my childhood was spent vacuuming or hearing the sound of vacuuming. Giving my parents this technology was like giving the Union forces the Gatling gun-you can do so much more damage so much more quickly. And with more frequency. The key element to the NuTone vac was that you could increase the sheer amount of "cleaning" opportunities in any given moment. As in, it encouraged rapid-response cleaning. Like, if one piece of lint was on the floor, one could, or dare I say, should, plug in the vac and deal with it like it was a medical emergency.<br><br>With the vacuum in place, our house was on its way to becoming "clear." As in, a perfectly self-contained cleaning environment. A real biosphere of neuroses. The plaintive wails of the NuTone vac system would wake me in the morning and put me to sleep at night. A giant sucking sound, if you will. And I never knew when and where it was going to come. The threat was always nigh. I would lie awake in bed and long for the simpler times, when vacuums were manual.<br><br>From the eyes of this child, this was just the way things were. Futuristic cleaning all the time and without any foreseeable slackening. The sheer force of constant cleaning was, of course, the veneer of order for a bubbling chaos beneath, and new technologies would only serve to stiffen that veneer. To this day, I can't clean. And that seems counterintuitive to the bulk of my upbringing, which was consumed with it. Maybe it was rebellion, or maybe I'm still in a state of shock, but to this day, I wipe off a table as if you handed a baby monkey a wet cloth.<br><br>I still get bizarre pleasure in watching people clean, though. One of the first things I did after making some money was hire a cleaning woman to come to my studio apartment in New York City. She was young and cute, but it was less sexual attraction than an attraction to the cleaning. I would sit and marvel at it, which made for an uncomfortable situation. There was always this very present energy coming from her, saying, "Why are you always hanging around here in your small apartment and watching me clean?" My intentions were very easy to misread, and it was a hard distinction to communicate, like, "I'm not gawking at you the way you're thinking. I just like to watch people clean. Because of my childhood. Seriously I just need to watch!"<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>How I Failed at Pretty Much Everything as a Kid (the Foundations of Failure)<br><br>I meet kids all the time lately who are really good at things, and I keep thinking, I don't remember being good at anything as a kid. My son, who is fourteen now, has many talented friends, some who play music, others who are savvy at coding; others speak several languages, some are precocious artists, etc. Mainly, as a kid, I just went to Friendly's. And I had so much time to get good at something, but no . . . nothing. A local pederast did try to get me into archery, but I even faltered at that, which I guess was a good thing: the avoiding pederasty part.<br><br>But why was I so averse to getting good at something? I remember this one kid in my elementary school who was an avid Cub Scout. He recruited me to join his Cub troop that was run by his father. His skill was that he knew how to tie something like five hundred different knots. So many knots. The double loop, the half hitch, the midline loop, the sailor's hitch, the strangle knot, even the super controversial hangman's knot. I went to one scout meeting at his house and we sat in a tent for at least two hours tying knots using a diagrammatic guide. He looked so happy. After the meeting, I immediately quit the Cub Scouts.<br><br>I often wonder if that kid finally ever hung himself or others. More likely, he's just an incredibly successful scout leader. But he was doing something, despite its being only tying knots. He was practicing sophisticated skills, even at nine years old. I recall reading about Ben Franklin, who left school at ten, apprenticed with his brother as a printer, then started writing for a newspaper at age fifteen. Jesus. I mean, c'mon. What a prodigious asshole.<br><br>My unique talents centered more around watching TV while eating SpaghettiOs raw from the can, which made my father rabidly mad, because he had installed in the TV room a white shag rug, that, as a consequence, had recurring and ever-growing concentric SpaghettiO stains. Also, I was proficient at taking a racquetball racket and hitting a tennis ball in my living room against the wide brick chimney for hours. That's a skill I could have possibly developed into something greater, but on the whole, it was more like what one would do for recreation in a supermax. And don't get me wrong: everyone's childhood is "like a prison," even though that's a bit "reductio ad custodia." But, look, starting early being "into something" has its consequences, too. One can carry that burden, heavy, of having tied all those knots.<br><br>For me, I just needed to find my own thing. Anything that would envelop my time beyond procrastination. Something that would set me on a higher path. The thing is, I was very shy and introverted. I didn't realize that then, but I enjoyed being home alone, despite the accompanying gripping loneliness. One thing I started to do was record myself on a Panasonic cassette player doing interviews. But because I seldom left my house, I would interview me as me or me as other people.<br><br>This turned out to be a relatively successful pet project, most evident in the time I interviewed myself as an astronaut on Voyager 1 and played it for all the kids at school and they went crazy. It, in a nutshell, exemplified the power of lying.<br><br>My hoax was so convincing that one student coaxed me to play it for our teachers. I played it for Mr. Simko, our gym teacher, and he was shocked. He asked me how I got to interview a real astronaut, and I told him that he came to my house because he was friendly with our neighbor who was a scientist.<br><br>Then I played it for my homeroom teacher Mr. Powers, and he immediately pointed out that Voyager 1 was unmanned.<br><br>"Oh . . . yeah, but he was in the space program."<br><br>"But he described seeing Earth from the spacecraft on Voyager One."<br><br>"Well, he must have been joking."<br><br>"But the whole interview was about him being in space."<br><br>"He must have been talking about a different spaceship."<br><br>"And as far I know, Jon, there is no astronaut in NASA named Biff Alderman."<br><br>I really should have stopped with the gym teacher, but that's the price one pays when one flies too close to the sun, or, in other words, plays a fake interview with an astronaut for a guy who has a completist knowledge of the space program.<br><br>Later, I tried school politics. In sixth grade, I ran for class treasurer. My only real experience with money thus far had been borrowing it from my parents and stealing it from my cousin's drawer. Both seemed ample qualifiers to run for treasurer. My decision to run was somewhat quixotic, as in I decided to run the day of the elections.<br><br>I was up against a girl named Doreen. She was smart, driven, and self-assured. She was running unopposed and had made signs to "Vote Doreen" and hung them all over the school. I was what is now called a "spoiler candidate." In the auditorium, in front of the class, Doreen gave her speech. It was well delivered and she spoke eloquently about raising funds to support a class trip to Boston. That was huge.<br><br>Though we were only an hour from Boston, it was like a galaxy away for most people in Worcester. Personally, I had been only a few times, but most kids talked about Boston like it was Paris. Like, "Have you been to Boston?" "Are you fucking kidding me? No fucking way. I've been to Shrewsbury, though."<br><br>She talked about working with the teachers and the school board to raise money for this trip to go to Paul Revere's house. She also talked about getting new outdoor equipment for the playground. New balls, new baseball equipment, and new nets for the basketball hoops.<br><br>I thought I had this in the bag. I was counting on the "no-nothing" vote. Nobody wants some loudmouth, proactive girl with a solid agenda, making promises about school trips and better overall conditions. Give them something they really want to hear: a hopeless message, a message that conveys "you get what you get." Why invest in new balls when we've been kicking around that deflated one for years? Do we really want to sully the memory of all those who came before us who kicked that deflated ball? Do we want some shiny new netting on the hoop when our forefathers played without them? What we needed was some hard-line illiberalism.<br><br>Instead, she completed her speech, and I was called up and I stood before the class, immediately drowning in flop sweat, and said, "What she said."<br><br>Everybody stared and the room started to melt and no one even uttered a chuckle. Even the heater hissed in disapproval. I received zero votes. Later that year, I looked over at Doreen while we stood in Paul Revere's dumb bedroom and she gave me a smug look. Whatever.<br><br>I tried music. My father played the clarinet. But he had stopped playing by the time I was born, so it was more my dad had a clarinet. My dad also had a gun. He never shot it. I guess it was for protection. He kept it hidden in a box somewhere on a shelf in the back of a hallway closet-a perfect spot for a gun when you need one quickly. In the event of a home invasion, my father would have to exchange pleasantries with the intruders, all the while subtly making his way to a closet at the other side of the house to get the gun. Or maybe his plan all along was to deceive them by telling them that he keeps all his money in a wooden box in a hall closet, then lure them to this closet and then, after using a stepladder to reach up to the shelf for the box, slowly open it, pull out the pistol, and say, �Oh, my mistake, this was the box with this in it,� then BLAM BLAM BLAM, shower them with bullets.</p><h2>Spirals in Time: The Secret Life and Curious Afterlife of Seashells</h2><p><p><b>A biological and cultural biography of the ubiquitous yet mystical seashell.</b></p><p>Seashells, stretching from the deep past into the present day, are touchstones leading into fascinating realms of the natural world and cutting-edge science.

Their shells provide homes for other animals, and across the ages, people have used shells not only as trinkets but also as a form of money, and as powerful symbols of sex and death, prestige and war. </p><p>The science and natural history of shells are woven into a compelling narrative, revealing their cultural importance and the ways they have been used by humans over the millennia, even as a source of mind-bending drugs. After surviving multiple mass extinctions millions of years ago, mollusks and their shells still face an onslaught of anthropocentric challenges, including climate change and corrosive oceans. But rather than dwelling on all that is lost, Scales emphasizes that seashells offer an accessible way to reconnect people with nature, helping to bridge the gap between ourselves and the living world. <i>Spirals in Time</i> shows why nature matters, and reveals the hidden wonders that you can hold in the palm of your hand.</p></p><p><b>Helen Scales</b> is a marine biologist who has tagged sharks in California and studied the diverse fish that live on coral reefs in the South Pacific.

She lives on Nantucket.1<br><br>It was completely by accident that Darcy Cotterill spied on her ex-�husband. She didn&#x2019;t want to see down into his backyard, or the yards of any of her neighbors, for that matter.<br><br>Really, it was the fault of the men who built these houses on Nantucket Island in the 1840s. Almost all the houses in the historic district, within walking distance to town, were built with an English basement, meaning the space was partly below ground but had large windows and its own door on the side of the house.<br><br>So, in order to walk in and out the front or back door of the main floor of the house, you had to climb a set of stairs at both the front and back doors.<br><br>That put the first floor, the main floor, ten feet above ground level, the perfect height for casually glancing into her neighbors&#x2019; yards as Darcy went about her day.<br><br>And how was she to know her ex-�husband and his new family would rent the house behind hers for the summer? She had no warning. One moment she was relaxing in her garden, and the next moment, heart attack!<br><br>Darcy owned this gorgeous house in the center of the town because her beloved, if slightly eccentric, grandmother had left it to her in her will. From the age of ten, Darcy had lived here with Penny, who was the only person in Darcy&#x2019;s dysfunctional family who stayed in one place long enough to take care of her. Darcy had adored Penny, and even now, every morning, she sent a prayer of gratitude to her grandmother.<br><br>Years ago, her grandmother had planted a hedge of spruce around the perimeter of the yard to form three tall thick walls with arched arbors on both sides of the house so friends could enter from the street. The backyard was private, and Darcy liked that. A narrow lane cut through on one side of her house, and she was glad the hedge concealed her yard. She had a public job, and she knew it wouldn&#x2019;t be appropriate if people passing down the narrow lane saw her as she was on this hot summer day, wearing only her briefest bikini.<br><br>And she wanted to keep this job forever. It was the job she had always dreamed of. She was a librarian! Specifically, she was the assistant director of the children&#x2019;s library of the Nantucket Atheneum. Her work was meaningful and pleasurable and involved lots of people. Still, she was glad when Sunday and Monday rolled around. These were her days off, her own special time to be alone to read and dream, especially in July and August when the island&#x2019;s population exploded from sixteen thousand vigorous year-�rounders to sixty thousand summer people.<br><br>On Sundays, Darcy joined a group of friends&#x2014;�some married, some with children, some single&#x2014;�for a lazy day of swimming and boating and cooking out. Monday was her day to run necessary errands and work in the garden or, on a rainy day, lie in bed reading, with her cat, Muffler, beside her.<br><br>Because July 4th was next Monday, work schedules were scrambled, so Darcy had today off from work. She had time to relax. She lay on a thick cushioned lounger, surrounded by flowers and birdsong, a wrought iron table nearby for her phone and iced tea.<br><br>She tilted her head back so the rays could touch her neck. Her face was protected with sunblock, and she felt as pale as a parsnip. Too many days working. Although, she remembered with a satisfied grin, during the nights she&#x2019;d spent in bed with Nash Forester, he had liked her skin just fine.<br><br>Next Sunday, when the gang met at Fat Ladies Beach, she&#x2019;d wear something with more coverage, but she enjoyed the thought of Nash seeing her with new tan lines. And that was the kind of thought she hadn&#x2019;t had for a long while, if ever.<br><br>The sun beat down on her closed eyelids. Sweat began to bead up behind her neck, trickling down her shoulders. She remembered last Sunday with Nash, when she was in his arms and the waves rocked their bodies together while they floated in the blue Atlantic and&#x2014;�<br><br>Her thoughts were interrupted by the quiet growl of a car as it pulled into the driveway of the house behind her.<br><br>Of course. It was almost July. Her summer neighbors were coming&#x2014;�cue music from Jaws&#x2014;�to occupy the houses around her. Some were pleasant, some were loud hard-�drinking partiers&#x2014;�as the joke went, &#x201c;Summer people&#x2014;�some are not.&#x201d; Some said hello when they saw her on the sidewalk in front of her house. Most ignored her. For them, she existed outside their summer fantasy bubble. It was all good with her. She was glad people could live here for a summer month or two. She had when she was younger, and she&#x2019;d thought it was paradise.<br><br>It still was, even as, on the other side of the hedges, car doors opened and slammed shut. Her new backyard neighbors spilled out into the sun, all talking at once.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, isn&#x2019;t it lovely here! And the house looks as pretty as the pictures!&#x201d; A woman, probably a wife and mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom. All the houses are gray.&#x201d; An adolescent girl, her tone a mix of sarcasm and tenderness.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, gang, grab a bag and let&#x2019;s see what this old place is like on the inside.&#x201d;<br><br>A man. Obviously the father. And something more, something impossible&#x2014;�it had been so long since Darcy had spoken with her ex-�husband&#x2014;�surely it couldn&#x2019;t be Boyz. But this particular male voice made her eyes snap open and the hair stand up on the back of her neck.<br><br>It couldn&#x2019;t be Boyz. His family always went to Lake George for the summer. It was an unforgiveable sin not to go to Lake George for the summer.<br><br>&#x201c;Willow, you can carry more than that. Take another bag of groceries.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s voice. The mother&#x2019;s.<br><br>The woman Boyz had left her for had a daughter named Willow.<br><br>Could it be Boyz?<br><br>&#x201c;Here, Willow, take the keys and unlock the front door. I&#x2019;ll get the suitcases.&#x201d;<br><br>The man&#x2019;s voice had the same tone as Boyz&#x2019;s, and Darcy was certain she heard just the slightest fake European accent all the Szwedas had. Their family had been American for generations, but they liked to claim an exiled Polish count as a relative, to explain their aristocratic (Darcy thought snotty) attitude.<br><br>The family headed toward the back door. Everyone talked at once. The voices receded as the group entered the house, but any minute now they&#x2019;d be checking out the second floor, choosing bedrooms&#x2014;�looking out the window at the view.<br><br>She knew she could see all the adjoining backyards from her windows, which meant they could see her from their windows. She couldn&#x2019;t lie here like a strip of undercooked bacon, yet she recoiled from the thought of running into the house like a frightened heroine from a Gothic romance.<br><br>But Darcy knew she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to relax in the garden until she was certain that the man on the other side of the hedge was not Boyz Szweda. Even though it was impossible that it was Boyz, this was a pretty desperate case of seeing is believing.<br><br>She stood, picked up her book and her water bottle, and slowly, humming, she strolled through the garden to her house. Boyz wouldn&#x2019;t recognize her from the back, after all, especially since she&#x2019;d grown out her once-�chic asymmetrically cut hair so long it fell in dark waves below her shoulders. She didn&#x2019;t hurry. She even paused to check her Knock Out rosebush before climbing the steps to the back porch and stepping inside.<br><br>She shut the door gently, quietly. She put her gardening tools in their rack. She leaned against the door and drew in a few deep breaths.<br><br>This was ridiculous. This was so not her kind of behavior. She was no longer a divorced and lonely female sniveling herself to sleep at night. She held an important position in the town&#x2019;s library. She had friends&#x2014;�she had a boyfriend, a carpenter, big and handsome and very good with his hands.<br><br>She should have Nash over for dinner tonight! She could throw something on the grill and they could open some beer and eat outdoors. She could change out of her gardening clothes and slip into a pretty sundress. . . .<br><br>Really? Were these thoughts really coming from her own mind? Clearly, she wasn&#x2019;t plotting to seduce Nash. All she had to do was open the front door to seduce Nash. Obviously, she wanted to show off for Boyz who might not even be there.<br><br>Maddening. Here she was, an accomplished woman thinking like a love-�scorned teenager.<br><br>The important thing was that Darcy was only thinking that way. Not acting that way. Yet.<br><br>She needed a distraction. She needed to get out of the house and away from this mood buzzing around her like a swarm of wasps.<br><br>So: Where was her cellphone? On the kitchen counter. Good. She hit Jordan&#x2019;s number. Darcy had known Jordan for only three years, but with some people a friendship fit perfectly and immediately, like the rare times when the first dress you tried on was instant magic. She had first met Jordan at the library&#x2014;�always a good omen. Darcy had taken her bag lunch out to the garden to eat on a bench by the crab apple trees, and she&#x2019;d heard the unmistakable sound of retching. Expecting to find some inexperienced drunken teenager, she discovered a pretty blond woman on her knees near the tulips.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; Darcy asked. &#x201c;How can I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>Without looking up, the woman croaked, &#x201c;My tote&#x2019;s over there. I&#x2019;ve got some saltines in a plastic bag and a can of 7Up. If you could bring it to me . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. And I&#x2019;ll get you some wet paper towels from the bathroom, so you can wipe your hands and face.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, thank you. But please don&#x2019;t tell the librarians that I barfed in their garden.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll shovel some dirt over it. No one will know.&#x201d;<br><br>By the time Darcy returned with the paper towels, the other woman had managed to move to a bench, where she sat very slowly chewing a tiny corner of a saltine.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she said to Darcy. She carefully wiped her hands and face and a few strands of sticky hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not drunk,&#x201d; she announced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pregnant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m a librarian,&#x201d; Darcy told her.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry I barfed in your garden.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better than if you&#x2019;d barfed on the books,&#x201d; Darcy said wryly.<br><br>The other woman managed a weak chuckle.<br><br>They sat on the bench for an hour, talking. For more than an hour, actually; Darcy went fifteen minutes over her lunch break, but she often came in early, so she figured she was allowed. She learned that Jordan was newly married to Lyle Morris, an island guy she&#x2019;d known and adored all her life. They&#x2019;d started kissing and making out when they were fourteen. They lost their virginity to each other when they were both sixteen, but it had been so quick and weird and they&#x2019;d been so guilt ridden and afraid she&#x2019;d gotten pregnant&#x2014;�she hadn&#x2019;t&#x2014;�that they never dated after that. After high school, Lyle went into the army. Jordan had worked at her parents&#x2019; liquor store and tried going out with other guys, but it never worked. She missed Lyle. She started writing Lyle, cheerful, sex-�free, letters. Four years later, when Lyle got out of the army, he walked into her parents&#x2019; store on Main Street, picked Jordan up in his powerful arms, carried her to his car, and drove to his apartment out on Surfside Road.<br><br>&#x201c;I know how to do it right this time,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told her.<br><br>And he did.</p><h2>Where Am I Now?: True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame</h2><p><b><b><b>"Thoughtfully traces [Mara Wilson's] journey from child actress to Hollywood dropout...<i>Who</i>&nbsp;is she now?

She lives in New York City.<b>The Junior Anti-Sex League</b><br><br> My mother could not have picked a worse time to teach me about sex.<br><br> One night, when I was five years old, she turned on the TV to a special about sex education. Kids my brother Danny&#x2019;s age were holding bags of flour, calling them their &#x201c;babies,&#x201d; and scrambling to find &#x201c;babysitters&#x201d; for them.<br><br> "Why are they doing that?" I said.<br><br> "They're learning about babies, how to take care of them, and how they're made," she said.<br><br> "Oh." I knew the last part: they were made in their mothers' bellies. I had seen my mother pregnant with my sister. But now the kids on the screen were in a classroom, and a teacher was talking to them about cells and body parts.<br><br> "What's she talking about?" I said.<br><br> "She's explaining sex to them."<br><br> I had heard that word before. I knew it was a loaded term, something grown-ups only said in whispers. "What is that?"<br><br> "It's how you make a baby," she said, and went on to describe the most absurd, unappealing process I could imagine.<br><br> She had always believed in telling children the truth, at least to the extent that they were capable of understanding. She was open about private parts and calling them by their real names. Her instincts about openness and honesty were right on, but still, I was horrified.<br><br> "You did that?" I blurted out. She nodded, and with a sickening feeling I counted up myself, my brothers and sister, and realized she must have done it at least five times.<br><br> "Any other questions?"<br><br> I had only one more. "When you did it, did you say 'Whoa'?"<br><br> My mother had the best of intentions. She made it clear this was not something to be discussed in polite company, that it needed to be kept a secret. But I had a tendency to blurt out secrets. I have always been compulsively honest, and usually at the wrong times. Five months earlier I had ruined my father's birthday surprise party by asking, "You don't know about our cakes, right?"<br><br> Objectively speaking, sex seemed shockingly gross and ridiculous. But as the shock wore off, the world felt different. I could tell that sex was a Big Deal. It was something new and exciting, a secret grown-ups kept to themselves. Just knowing about it made me feel powerful. I had to tell someone.<br><br> And I had a big scene on the set of Mrs. Doubtfire the next day.<br><br> It was not my mother who had gotten me into acting. Not really. She was not a stage mother. But she was an actress: she had studied theater in college and never missed an opportunity to perform. My brothers and I went to Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School, and every year on Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s birthday, Teddy himself would come by, in person.<br><br> ". . . And I said, 'Don't you dare shoot that bear!' They made a little stuffed bear and named it after me, and that's why we call them teddy bears today!"<br><br> "Teddy" was only about five foot two, with D-cup breasts and a hat I had seen in my mother's closet, but her performance was convincing enough to make some of the kids ask, "Is that really him? I thought he was dead." My mother disappeared into the role, morphing from a tiny woman into one of the most macho men who ever lived.<br><br> We lived in Burbank, in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, twenty minutes away from Hollywood. My mother always said of our hometown, "It's as if someone picked up a small city in the Midwest and plopped it down in the middle of Los Angeles." Burbank tried its hardest to stay quaint, but it was also home to Warner Brothers, NBC, and Disney Studios. The tentacles of the entertainment industry reached into everyone's lives. My father worked as an electronics engineer at CBS, NBC, and the local channel KTLA. Classmates came to school in cars with license plate frames reading part of the magic: walt disney company, and my brothers would borrow movie screeners from friends with well-connected parents when we didn't want to wait for video. Given the omnipresence of the entertainment industry, getting into acting wasn't an unusual thing for a Burbank kid to do. Children all over the world do ridiculous, borderline dangerous things, and no one around them questions it, because it's ingrained in their culture. So it was with child acting in Southern California.<br><br> When I was a toddler, the oldest and most outgoing of my siblings, Danny, started trying out for commercials. He was cute and a quick study, booking a few TV ads, and even some small parts in movies. Watching my mother and Danny rehearse, I had an epiphany. What they did was like when I performed my stories at home, only better, because people wanted to see you perform! Shortly after my fifth birthday, I went right up to my mother and told her, "Mommy, I want to do what Danny does."<br><br> "No, you don't," she said.<br><br> They were already starting to feel burned out. She was relieved that Danny had never become recognizably famous, and that he didn't want to be an actor when he grew up. He had been a confident, resilient kid, but the cycle of auditioning was getting to him. It would be worse with her anxious, oversensitive daughter.<br><br> "How about this," she said when I kept asking to audition. "Your brothers and I are going to pretend to be the people at a commercial, okay? We'll tell you what to do and then tell you if you got the part."<br><br> As always, I took playing pretend very seriously. I "acted" the lines about cereal or Barbies as well as I could, but every time my mother would say, "You were great, but you didn't get the part." And every time I would shrug.<br><br> "That's okay," I'd say. "I can just go on another one." For the first time in her life, my mother had no idea what to say.<br><br> I would follow Danny's example: get a few small roles, have fun with it, save some money for college, then give it up after a few years. I would never be famous. But after getting a few commercials, I was called in for a movie.<br><br> "So what would you think if your dad dressed up like a woman?" a man asked me, along with a few other girls who were auditioning. The other girls looked at the ground, murmuring, "I guess it would be funny." I burst out laughing and said, "I would be on the floor!"<br><br> I got called back. And then got called back again, and again. We were called to do a screen test in San Francisco, and before I knew it, I had the part. I was going to be in a movie.<br><br> But just because I'd gotten the part didn't mean I knew what I was doing. There was definitely a learning curve. For example, how was I supposed to know what to do if I had to go to the bathroom during the pool scene? (My mother and I eventually came up with a code so I wouldn't end up peeing on the lovely and handsome Pierce Brosnan.) How was I supposed to know that asking some of the crew members to "clap for me" was inappropriate? Everyone clapped for me when I sang in the kindergarten holiday concert. Why couldn't they do it here, too? My mother was, predictably, furious, pulling me aside and saying, "'Clap for me' is not acceptable!"<br><br> She and my father were determined not to let being in a movie go to my head. I always knew they loved me and they were proud, but they had to keep me grounded. If I said something like "I'm the greatest!" my mother would be right there to bring me back down to Earth. <br><br> "You're not the greatest," she said. "You're just an actor. You're just a kid."<br><br> The day after the sex talk, we were shooting a scene where we helped Sally Field choose a dress to wear to her birthday party. Her ex-husband, Robin Williams, has been denied custody of their kids, and to spend more time with them, he answers her ad for a housekeeper and nanny. Robin, dressed in full drag as an eccentric Scottish nanny named Mrs. Doubtfire, was supposed to come in, ask about the party, and realize he had a major conflict. Lisa Jakub would say her line, then I would say mine. But I wasn&#x2019;t focusing on the scene. I was bubbling with excitement, because I knew this thing, this big open secret, and I could not keep it in any longer.<br><br> My mother had stressed that sex was something that happened only when you were married, so when Virginia, one of the hairdressers, came over to touch up my bangs, I impulsively asked her, "Are you married?"<br><br> "Yes," she said.<br><br> "Oh," I said. "So you've done it, right?"<br><br> She looked surprised, then laughed, embarrassed. She didn't answer, and I felt unsatisfied. As soon as she walked away I announced in a singsong voice, "I KNOW ABOUT SE-EX! I KNOW ABOUT SE-EX!"<br><br> The whole crew was laughing, and I was giddy. They knew that I knew what they knew! I was triumphant, full of pure childish glee-until I saw my mother standing off to the side of the set. She was enraged. When my mother was angry, she was terrifying. She looked like Margaret Hamilton as the witch in The Wizard of Oz, or Emma Goldman's mug shot. How many times had she lectured me about behaving properly on the set? How many times in our conversation had she stressed that this was not something to talk about in public? How had I forgotten both of these things?<br><br> I immediately stopped singing, and with a sinking feeling I knew I had done something bad, and that I was going to be in deep trouble. Instantly, I felt humiliated, and worst of all, I knew I had brought it all on myself. I thought I might start crying. I wanted to apologize, tell my mother I would never do it again, anything to get that scary look off her face and rescue what was left of my pride.<br><br> I watched as Robin, in full Doubtfire drag, walked up to Chris, the director.<br><br> "Did you hear that Mara was asking Virginia about sex?" Robin said, and they both burst out laughing. They both had kids. They had both worked with kids. They knew what kids were like.<br><br> "You know, Mara," Chris said, turning to me, "if you want, you can tell Sally her dress is sexy."<br><br> I didn't dare. But I looked to my mother, and her face had softened a little. I was still going to get a lecture, but because they had been able to laugh it off, I had probably managed to avoid a spanking.<br><br> I stayed awake that night, thinking of how badly I'd embarrassed myself. It was the first of many nights like that in my life. Did anyone else remember? What did they think of me? I had learned my lesson, and too well. Sex was powerful, something I needed to respect.<br><br> But if it was so secret and special, though, why did it suddenly seem to be everywhere?<br><br> There&#x2019;s a saying that if a child doesn&#x2019;t learn about sex from her parents, she&#x2019;ll learn about it on the street. I learned a good amount about it on one particular street: Melrose Place.<br><br> "You have an audition for a soap opera," my mother told me shortly after my sixth birthday, handing over my "sides," the script excerpt for the audition. "Your character's mother came from Russia, and her time here in America is almost up. She wants to stay here, though, so she gets married to a man named Matt, but he is actually gay."<br><br> "What does that mean?" I said.<br><br> "It means a man loves other men, not women. Or when women love women. It's just the way some people are."<br><br> "Oh, okay," I said. It seemed a little unusual, but not gross or disturbing. I thought of the girl at my preschool who had once told me she loved me and wanted to marry me. I had said, "Sure," so as not to hurt her feelings.<br><br> "Two men can't do it like men and women do it, could they?" I asked my mother a while later, as an afterthought.<br><br> "Not like men and women, no," she said carefully, after a moment. "It wouldn't work."<br><br> Lucky them, I thought, not having to do any of that gross sex stuff.<br><br> I got the part. My mother laughed when she saw the call sheet: next to my name it said &#x201c;(K),&#x201d; for kid: I was going to be the only one on set.<br><br> At first, we would tape my episodes and watch them later, my parents fast-forwarding through the racier scenes. But eventually my mother relented and just let me watch the episodes in their entirety. She had a strange barometer for what was appropriate: she was upset when I watched Hocus Pocus at a friend's house, but took me to see Four Weddings and a Funeral in the theater. To be fair, she must have figured I wouldn't understand what was happening on Melrose-after all, I had thought the couple having sex in Four Weddings was just bouncing on a trampoline I couldn't see.<br><br> Melrose Place was the most terrifying show I had ever seen. People I knew and loved were playing characters who hurt one another in spectacularly detailed ways. Michael was driving drunk and doing it with three different women. Sydney was using drugs and doing it with three different men. Even Billy and Alison, the nice characters, were doing it, sometimes with each other, sometimes with other people. (Matt, my gay stepfather, didn't do anything bad, but that was because they weren't allowed to show two men kissing on TV.)<br><br> I had always wondered what grown-ups got up to when they weren't with their kids, and now I knew. To me, Melrose Place was an expos� on the secret lives of grown-ups. A little exaggerated at times, maybe-probably in real life there were fewer fights ending in pools-but at its core, I believed it told the truth, and I was scandalized.<br><br> "I thought you were only allowed to do it if you were married!" I told my mother.<br><br> "I said you should only do it if you're married," she said.<br><br> But they did it anyway. "Should" meant nothing to them. There was only one conclusion I could draw: children were clearly morally superior. Kids could be cruel, but it was simple and reflexive: you're in my way, so I'll push you; you said something I didn't like, so I'll call you stupid. But grown-up cruelty was premeditated, calculated, and clever. Kids, I believed, were virtuous because we didn't have that thing, that invisible, corrupting force that held all grown-ups in its sway: sex.</p><h2>Cafe Pasqual&#39;s Cookbook: Spirited Recipes from Santa Fe</h2><p>Cafe Pasqual's, a small, bustling, and perpetually jammed restaurant in the heart of Santa Fe, draws on a wide range of Southwestern and Mexican culinary traditions to create an original menu based on fresh, authentic ingredients and emphatic flavors.

He lives in Newark, New Jersey.<br></p><p>This scintillating collection by Amiri Imamu Baraka, published in 1968 under his birth name Leroi Jones, covers a wide range of jazz writings from 1959 to 1967. Baraka's engaging and prophetic portraits of Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Bradford, Cecil Taylor, Thelonious Monk, Roy Haynes, Don Cherry, and John Coltrane (whom he called "the heaviest spirit") beam with an electric and fluid language that mirrors those artists' speed-of-light improvisations. In "Jazz and the White Critic," which blasts white critics who judge jazz by European, rather than African American, standards, Jones wrote, "As Western people, the sociocultural thinking of 18th-century Europe comes to us as history and legacy that is a continuous and organic part of the 20th-century West. The sociocultural philosophy of the Negro in America ... is no less specific and no less important for any intelligent critical speculation about the music that came out of it." His analysis of the burgeoning avant-garde scene in "Apple Cores #1-6," "New York Loft and Coffee Shop Jazz," and "The Jazz Avant-Garde" accurately depicts the artistic promise and peril of that period in the words of a literary genius who was there and helped create it. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>[This collection of pieces] written in the 1960&#39;s provides a clear picture of where one segment of the modern Negro community stands musically--and socially. . . .

Like her wedding day. Like 9/11.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d overdressed that afternoon in sweatpants and a long-sleeved T-shirt, and she came off the trail with her face dripping and her ponytail saturated. She reached into her car for a tall bottle of water, guzzled most of it down, and poured the few remaining ounces over her head. Jordan checked the timer on her watch. Ninety-seven minutes. That extra two miles was going to make her late getting home, and Ethan would be in a sulk. She needed to hurry.<br> <br>First, though, she tipped her head back to gaze at the sky and took a moment to just be. The late-afternoon sun touched her cheeks. She inhaled the crisp fall breeze, tinged with cedar. The runner&#x2019;s high thrummed in her veins and her muscles felt loose. She could do anything. Everything. She could run the whole course all over again, right this minute if she wanted to.<br> <br>But Ethan was waiting. She checked her watch again and tossed the empty bottle into the car.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you wouldn&#x2019;t happen to have a phone, would you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jordan turned around and saw a young man standing beside a green minivan several spaces away. She glanced over her shoulder to see if he was talking to someone else.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the battery again.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s going to kill me this time&#x2014;she told me to get it changed.&#x201d; When Jordan hesitated, his expression turned wary. &#x201c;But looks like you&#x2019;re in a hurry. You probably don&#x2019;t have time to play Good Samaritan, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She stepped forward. &#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; Then she remembered what he&#x2019;d asked for and reached back into her car. Her cell phone was locked in the glove compartment, and she dug it out.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want me to call Triple A or . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>He sauntered over. &#x201c;Thanks, but I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She surveyed him more carefully now, feeling odd about handing over her phone to a complete stranger, even a nice-looking one. He was tall, dark-haired, and had wire-rimmed glasses. He wore faded jeans and a Rice University sweatshirt with the familiar blue crest on the front.<br> <br>Jordan passed him the phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve actually got a favorite mechanic, if you can believe it. He specializes in German cars, but he owes me a favor, so . . .&#x201d; He dialed a number with his thumb and pressed the phone to his ear, and Jordan turned around, pretending not to eavesdrop. She wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her arm. In the distance she heard a pair of high-pitched barks as some dogs encountered each other on the trail.<br> <br>&#x201c;No answer. Damn. You have any jumper cables?&#x201d; He smiled hopefully.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Fraid not.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighed and looked around at the surrounding scenery&#x2014;canyons, hills, and scrub brush as far as the eye could see. &#x201c;So, what do you think the odds are we&#x2019;ll be able to get a tow truck out here by sundown?&#x201d; He glanced at the sky. &#x201c;Not good, I&#x2019;m guessing. I probably better call the wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>Relieved for some reason, she turned away to give him privacy as he made the call.<br> <br>A weight slammed into her. Air exploded from her lungs with an oomf! and her face plowed into the gravel. She shrieked. The sound was cut off as her head was yanked back and then smashed forward. Pain lanced through her skull.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make a sound,&#x201d; he growled in her ear.<br> <br>Jordan&#x2019;s pulse pounded. Her mind reeled. She squirmed and struggled to breathe as his knee dug into her spine.<br> <br>&#x201c;You hear me?&#x201d; He yanked her ponytail again, and her head snapped back. She gazed up at the blue sky and smelled her own terror, ripe and pungent.<br> <br>This isn&#x2019;t happening. But it was. Tears burned her eyes and her neck arched painfully. Her heart thundered inside her too-tight chest. For the first time in her life, she felt a fear so complete it replaced every sensation in her body.<br> <br>Jordan bucked. She kicked and twisted, throwing elbows and knees. The weight slipped off and she scrambled to her feet. Fire shot down her leg as he clawed her skin.<br> <br>She lunged for her car. He was right behind. He tackled her and she was on the ground again. A fist smashed into her cheek and a bright burst of pain exploded behind her eyes. Blood filled her mouth. She felt a tooth sliding around on her tongue.<br> <br>He yanked her head back, and through the daze she felt him shift on top of her. She tried to scream, but his weight was on her and it came out like a wisp of air. A hand clamped hard over her mouth. He hauled her to her feet and dragged her across the gravel, and through tear-blurred vision she saw her car.<br> <br>This isn&#x2019;t happening. No, no, no!<br> <br>Jordan writhed and struggled. Pain radiated down her right arm, but she used it anyway, reaching back, desperately trying to gouge his eyes. He gripped her harder. In the corner of her eye, she saw the side of the van. She kicked viciously, trying to break his hold. A muffled curse. He flung her against something hard, making her brain rattle against her skull. Nausea washed over her as his arms tightened once more. The pain was consuming. She felt it taking over, swallowing up her will to resist. All of her limbs quivered.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point in fighting.&#x201d; His breath was hot against her neck. &#x201c;Just be quiet and I won&#x2019;t have to hurt you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jordan knew he was lying. From deep inside her came a primal scream.</p><h2>Be Prepared for the AP Calculus Exam</h2><p><i>Be Prepared for the AP Calculus Exam</i> is your indispensable guide to scoring well on the Advanced Placement Calculus AB or BC exam.

First formulated in the sixth century BCE, the teachings of Confucius would come to dominate Chinese society, politics, economics, and ethics. In this<em> Very Short Introduction</em>, Daniel K. Gardner explores the major philosophical ideas of the Confucian tradition, showing their profound impact on state ideology and imperial government, the civil service examination system, domestic life, and social relations over the course of twenty-six centuries. Gardner focuses on two of the Sage's most crucial philosophical problems-what makes for a good person, and what constitutes good government-and demonstrates the enduring significance of these questions today. <br><br>This volume shows the influence of the Sage's teachings over the course of Chinese history--on state ideology, the civil service examination system, imperial government, the family, and social relations--and the fate of Confucianism in China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as China developed alongside a modernizing West and Japan. Some Chinese intellectuals attempted to reform the Confucian tradition to address new needs; others argued for jettisoning it altogether in favor of Western ideas and technology; still others condemned it angrily, arguing that Confucius and his legacy were responsible for China's feudal, ''backward'' conditions in the twentieth century and launching campaigns to eradicate its influences. Yet Chinese continue to turn to the teachings of Confucianism for guidance in their daily lives. <br><br>In addition to a survey of the philosophy and history of Confucianism, Gardner offers an examination of the resurgence of Confucianism in China today, and explores what such a revival means for the Chinese government and the Chinese people.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

As a man he moved to America, started a family, and eventually became a Christian. Then he risked retribution as he returned home to share his faith with his family and former boss. <i>Once an Arafat Man</i> is a story of the ultimate triumph of love over hatred, of reconciliation over divisions. It&#x2019;s a story that can inspire us all to overcome the conflicts in our own lives.</p><p><b>At age seventeen,</b> Tass Saada was carrying a high-powered Simonov rifle. He had run away from home and become <b>a PLO sniper and chauffeur for Arafat.</b> <br>His experience growing up as a <b>Palestinian refugee in Saudi Arabia</b> had taught him to hate. And like many other Palestinians, he had his hatred&#x2015;and his rifle&#x2015;aimed squarely at Israel. <br>Tass Saada&#x2019;s story could have ended tragically, another casualty of the centuries of hatred brewing in the Middle East. But Tass was destined for better things. His story will give you an intimate look at<br><ul><li>the world of Yasser Arafat; </li><li>the life, struggles, and heart of a Palestinian refugee; </li><li>a Muslim who converted to Christianity and faced retribution at the hands of his relatives; and </li><li>the transformation of hatred into love and hope.</li></ul>This is more than the story of a Palestinian refugee making something good of his life in America. It&#x2019;s a story of the ultimate triumph of love over hatred, reconciliation over persistent divisions. It&#x2019;s a story that can inspire us all to overcome the divisions and conflicts in our own lives.Author Saada, born in the Gaza Strip and reared as a refugee in Saudi Arabia and Auatar, became a sniper for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as a young man. He also served as Yassar Arafat&#39;s chauffeur. With co-author Dean Merrill (In the Presence of My Enemies), Saada retraces his life&#39;s journey from hatred to love in Once an Arafat Man: The True Story of How a PLO Sniper Found a New Life. Saada encountered Christ in a Damascaus road-like experience when he relocated to America at the age of 23. This experience not only infused his life with purpose, but also shifted his theological understanding and perspective on interracial and interfaith relationships. After all, for a Muslim to worship Christ is to risk life and limb, yet Saada counted the cost, even facing his relatives with his newfound faith. This book is a fascinating window into the book of Genesis, Islamic culture and the Arab-Israeli conflict. More importantly, it is a story of the ultimate hope rooted in Christ, the Savior of all--including Jews and Muslims. --Christian Retailing, October 13, 2008</p><h2>Pale as Death (Krewe of Hunters, 25)</h2><p><strong><em>From the dark depths of Hollywood&#x2019;s past</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><br><br>The crime scene is horrific: the corpse of a young actress, drained of blood and cut in two.

Not a work of speculative history, this expos� is founded on primary source material and historical documents and provides strange parallels between supernatural forces such as shaminism, ritual magic, and cult practices and contemporary interrogation techniques such as those used by the CIA under the general rubric of MK-ULTRA. Fascinating details on Nixon and the "Dark Tower," the Assassin cult and more recent Islamic terrorism, and the bizarre themes that run through American history from its discovery by Columbus to the political assassinations of the 1960s are revealed.</p><p><p><strong>Peter Levenda has researched the material for this book over the course of 25 years, visiting more than 40 countries and gaining access to temples, prisons, military installations, and government documents.

A woman may feel anxious, inadequate, intimidated -- and as if she is walking on tiptoe. And she may find herself trying harder and harder to make things right without ever being successful. Ann Jones and Susan Schechter bring together their more than fifteen years of experience working with women in abusive relationships to offer an eyeopening new analysis of controlling partners and a wealth of empowering information for women who want to change their lives for the better. Full of moving first-person stories, <em>When Love Goes Wrong </em>shows women what their options are in or out of the relationship, provides concrete guidance on finding safety and support for themselves and their children, and includes a comprehensive list of agencies offering information or assistance.</p></p><p>Abusive relationships are more common than many women think, charge Jones ( Women Who Kill ) and Schechter ( Women and Male Violence ). They argue that even men who have never been physically violent toward their partners may be abusers. Constant criticism, for example, is a nonphysical method of control that, if thwarted, may escalate into violence. Therefore, the authors state, a woman married to a manipulative or overly critical man is in a potentially dangerous situation and should make plans to prevent harm to herself and her children. The book's first half, which includes case histories, provides guidelines to help women determine if they are in an abusive relationship. The second section gives advice on how to escape and where to find emergency help, legal services and financial support systems. Of great importance for abused women and professionals who counsel them.

In a study that will be the standard treatment of the topic for years to come, Cardinal Dulles takes up such issues as the Magisterium&#39;s nature and function, the roots of the Magisterium in the New Testament and its development in the history of the Church, the relationship between the hierarchy of the Church and the theological academy, the scope of the Church&#39;s infallibility, the response due to the Magisterium&#39;s teachings, and the role of the Church&#39;s reception of magisterial teaching. Written for those seeking clarity, wisdom, and erudition about the Church&#39;s Magisterium, this book stands head and shoulders above any other presently available. Its accessible style makes it a valuable not only for scholars but for all Catholics.</p><p>Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society, Fordham University, and Professor Emeritus, The Catholic University of America, is an internationally known theologian and lecturer, and the author of twenty-two books and 800 articles on theological topics. Past President of both the Catholic Theological Society of America and the American Theological Society, Cardinal Dulles has served on the International Theological Commission (1992-97) and as a member of the United States Lutheran/Roman Catholic Dialogue (1972-1993). Since 1992 he has served continuously as a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He was created a Cardinal of the Catholic Church in Rome on February 21, 2001 by Pope John Paul II, the first American-born theologian who is not a bishop to receive this honor.For years now professors and students of ecclesiology have sorely needed an up-to-date book on the Magisterium. Now it has been written and by a theologian who has been rightly described as the dean of Catholic theologians in America. Written in his usual sober and comprehensive style, Cardinal Dulles has given us a book that undoubtedly will be the standard work on the subject of the Magisterium for many years to come. Professors, pastors, and students will want to return to it again and again. --Lawrence J. Welch, Kenrick School of Theology<br><br>Substantial theological and ecumenical questions cluster around the term 'magisterium': Does the Church need a teaching office? Can we clearly trace its origins? What is its sphere of competence and the force of its pronouncements? Most importantly, how does it give living witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ? In this comprehensive and highly readable study, Avery Cardinal Dulles answers these questions and others like it with a compelling precision honed by a lifetime of reflection on the Church and her singular mission. This book is a rich and informative resource for all inquirers into the nature, purpose and testimony of the teaching office of the Catholic Church. --Thomas G. Guarino, Professor of Systematic Theology, Seton Hall University<br><br>With concise accuracy and clarity Cardinal Dulles provides a comprehensive introduction to the essential elements and historical developments of the Church's Magisterium. It is integral to the mission given by Jesus Christ to the apostles and their successors to preach and teach the revealed Word of God. The excellent theological exposition is complemented by the appendices with key conciliar and papal documents on the subject. Those concerned with the truth of Catholic faith must read this fine treatment of the teaching office of the Church. Cardinal Dulles's book is an auspicious inauguration of an important series of introductions to Catholic doctrines by Sapientia Press. --Matthew L. Lamb, Ave Maria University</p><h2>Etty Hillesum: A Life Transformed</h2><p>On 8 March 1941, a 27-year-old Jewish Dutch student living in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam made the first entry in a diary that was to become one of the most remarkable documents to emerge from the Nazi Holocaust. Over the course of the next two and a half years, an insecure, chaotic and troubled young woman was transformed into someone who inspired those with whom she shared the suffering of the transit camp at Westerbork and with whom she eventually perished at Auschwitz. Through her diary and letters, she continues to inspire those whose lives she has touched since. She was an extraordinarily alive and vivid young woman who shaped and lived a spirituality of hope in the darkest period of the twentieth century. This book explores Etty Hillesum&#39;s life and writings, seeking to understand what it was about her that was so remarkable, how her journey developed, how her spirituality was shaped, and what her profound reflections on the roots of violence and the nature of evil can teach us today.</p><p>Patrick Woodhouse is a writer and an Anglican priest. He was for thirteen years a Canon of Wells Cathedral. He has also worked as a parish priest, and a social responsibility adviser in two Anglican dioceses. His publications include <i>Beyond Words</i>, a guide to a contemplative way of prayer, and <i>With You is the Well of Life</i>, a collection of prayers for private and public use (both published by Kevin Mayhew.) He now lives in south Somerset.<p>&#x201c;[Hillesum's] inspirational reflections on the roots of violence and the nature of evil have as much relevance now as they did in the 1940s.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Bookseller, February 2009</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] superb and moving account of her life and writings, touching on Hillesum's profound reflections on violence and the nature of evil.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Catholic Herald, April 2009</i></p><p>&#x201c;Complicated, intelligent, passionate and disarming by turns, Etty Hillesum is interpreted here as a woman for our time. The forward to the book, written by the Archbishop of Canterbury, argues that by examining the life of Etty Hillesum, the reader is able to understand how a theology of hope and of the redemptive meaning of suffering can emerge, even from the darkest of contexts.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lavinia Byrne, Cheddar Valley Gazette, March 2009</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a very precious book that left me feeling very grateful for the life of Etty Hillesum. Patrick Woodhouse has written about her with a clarity and unobtrusive simplicity that is wholly appropriate.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>One in Christ, Jonathan Gorsky</i></p><p>&#x201c;Etty was pyschologically complex to say the least, and her story presents us with a disturbing and challenging spirituality for a world wracked with hatred.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Tablet</i></p><p>&#x201c;A touching and wonderful book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Good Book Stall</i></p><p>&#x201c;For anyone involved in pastoral care, there are rich and thought-provoking resources here and Woodhouse is an excellent guide. ... Inspiring and deceptively simple book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Pastoral Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is at home in a silent sanctuary and in a noisy prison &#x2013; in any place, at any time. Read it. Let it do what it will ... In this memoir of Etty, Patrick Woodhouse has done far more than condense her story into 153 pages. He has immersed himself in her life so deeply and so passionately that Etty seems to be speaking through him&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Church Times</i></p></p><h2>Selected Writings (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Jos�</b> <b>Mart�</b> (1853-1895) is the most renowned political and literary figure in the history of Cuba. A poet, essayist, orator, statesman, abolitionist, and the martyred revolutionary leader of Cuba's fight for independence from Spain, Mart� lived in exile in New York for most of his adult life, earning his living as a foreign correspondent. Throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, Mart�'s were the eyes through which much of Latin America saw the United States. His impassioned, kaleidoscopic evocations of that period in U.S. history, the assassination of James Garfield, the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, the execution of the Chicago anarchists, the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans, and much more, bring it rushing back to life. <br><br>Organized chronologically, this collection begins with his early writings, including a thundering account of his political imprisonment in Cuba at age sixteen. The middle section focuses on his journalism, which offers an image of the United States in the nineteenth century, its way of life and system of government, that rivals anything written by de Tocqueville, Dickens, Trollope, or any other European commentator. Including generous selections of his poetry and private notebooks, the book concludes with his astonishing, hallucinatory final masterpiece, "War Diaries", never before translated into English.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Award winning author and journalist Peter Godwin writes with pathos and intimacy about Zimbabwe's spiral into chaos and, along with it, his family's steady collapse. This dramatic memoir is a searing portrait of unspeakable tragedy and exile, but it is also vivid proof of the profound strength of the human spirit and the enduring power of love.<br><em></em><br>"In the tradition of Rian Malan and Philip Gourevitch, a deeply moving book about the unknowability of an Africa at once thrilling and grotesque. In elegant, elegiac prose, Godwin describes his father's illness and death in Zimbabwe against the backdrop of Mugabe's descent into tyranny. His parent's waning and the country's deterioration are entwined so that personal and political tragedy become inseparable, each more profound for the presence of the other" -- Andrew Solomon, author of <em>The Noonday Demon<br></em><br>"A fascinating, heartbreaking, deeply illuminating memoir that has the shape and feel of a superb novel." -Kurt Anderson, author of <em>Heydey</em></p><p><strong>Peter Godwin<em> </em></strong>is an award winning author, journalist and film-maker. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, he studied at Cambridge and Ovford and became a foreign correspondent for the<em> Sunday Times</em> of London and BBC TV. Since moving to the US, he has written for <em>National Geographic, </em>the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> and <em>Newsweek</em>.Reviewed by Wendy Kann<p> In 2000, Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, held a referendum to perpetuate his decades-long rule. He lost. Incensed, he annulled the results and set about destroying his suspected opposition. The economy imploded, and Zimbabwe fell into chaos. In When a Crocodile Eats the Sun -- a reference to solar eclipses, the most apocalyptic of African omens -- Peter Godwin, an acclaimed Zimbabwean journalist now living in Manhattan, masterfully weaves the political and the highly personal. An eyewitness account of that cataclysmic time, When a Crocodile Eats the Sun is also a tribute to Godwin's aging parents and a searing exploration of the author's own soul.</p><p>The Godwins had immigrated from England to Africa in the early 1950s, where Peter's father, George -- nearly broken from the traumas of World War II -- reinvented himself, managing copper mines, timber estates and government transport. He was a fierce believer in fairness and integrity, sending letters decrying the political corruption of Mugabe's government to the state-owned Zimbabwe Herald under the pseudonym "Rustic Realist." His wife, Helen, an adored doctor at a cash-strapped government hospital, began work before dawn and treated more than 80 patients daily. The couple had three children. Jain, their eldest, was killed on the eve of her wedding in a tragic car accident; Peter was exiled in 1983 for breaking the story of Mugabe's massacre of thousands. Georgina became a Zimbabwean media darling, lately banished for her independent coverage, who now beams hard-to-hear news to her homeland from a lonely London studio. </p><p>Mugabe's violent reclamation of mostly white-owned commercial farmland destroyed Zimbabwe's food supply, fostered lawlessness, and shattered the country's economy. Increasingly isolated as their friends flee the repression and hyperinflation, and barely surviving on now worthless Zimbabwean pensions, the elderly Godwins pointedly avoid buying much needed gasoline and medical supplies on a growing black market that they feel benefits only the privileged few. They would rather walk to polling stations and wait in long lines for hours in the hot sun to participate in ultimately farcical local elections. They eat mainly bread and cabbage but consider Peter's attempts to replenish their pantry using American dollars as vulgarly extravagant in light of the extreme poverty suffered by most of the country's inhabitants. As hundreds of the starving and unemployed spill into Harare's suburbs, a swelling camp of the indigent lingers just beyond the Godwins' hedge. Belligerent officials shoulder into their modest yard, claiming bogus infractions and demanding bribes. George is hijacked at his gate by men who beat him to the ground and then toy with killing him.</p><p>As his parents' health quickly deteriorates -- George has heart trouble and gangrene, Helen has sciatica -- the frantic author risks slipping into Zimbabwe on frequent magazine assignments despite his exile status. He finds himself on the front line as Mugabe's murderous, pillaging mobs invade farms and smash agricultural infrastructure. An interview with an opposition candidate evolves into a nightlong ordeal fending off goons. Incognito at a political rally, Peter watches farm workers get selected for "re-education" while sullen armed teenagers prowl the remaining crowd, prodding people to raise fists higher, to cheer louder.</p><p> And yet much of the book is wryly comic as Godwin describes the absurdities endured by Zimbabwe's white middle class. George's battered Mazda 323 is jerry-rigged with locks and alarms and practically roped to the side of their house. Peter, entertaining his parents with an outing to gawk at McMansions being built by political favorites, takes a wrong turn and finds himself on the prohibited dead end street leading to Robert Mugabe's new palace:</p><p> "As we round the bend . . . we see that the soldiers have been reinforced by a dozen more. These new ones carry machine guns, and the brass bullets in their bandoliers shimmer with menace as they catch the sun. At least ten weapons are now pointed directly at us.</p><p>" 'Oh, God!' mutters Mum. 'We're all going to be shot. I told you we should have gotten a new atlas, Dad.' " </p><p>As Godwin faces both his parents' mortality and his country's collapse, he is tormented by the devastating loss of his own identity. One evening, while still mourning George's recent death, Peter stumbles across a roadblock. When he refuses to offer the expected bribe, an armed and angry policeman forces him to pull over and wait, possibly all night, as punishment. Minutes later, a bus rattles up and as sacks are hurled out for the police to plunder, an old woman pleads for her meager bag of maize. Godwin, fully aware he could be killed for interfering, cannot bear the injustice of the woman's predicament and offers money on her behalf. He is viciously ordered off, but we are left with no doubt at all that Peter Godwin has inherited George and Helen's fortitude. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

He lives with his grandparents because his parents are dead. It is a difficult life but made easier by the love Lee shares with his grandparents. But now Lee must leave all that he knows. Before his parents died, they spent all of their money buying a &#34;paper son slot&#34; for Lee to go to America. Being a &#34;paper son&#34; means pretending to be the son of a family already in America. If he goes, he will have the chance for a better life. But first he must pass the test at Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco. Only then will he be allowed to live with his new family. If Lee makes even a single mistake, he could be sent back to China. Lee knows his grandparents want a better life for him. He can&#39;t let them down.</p><p><i>Paper Son: Lee's Journey to America</i> has been nominated for the California Young Reader Medal in the Picture Books for Older Readers category for the 2016-2017 school year!<b>Kirkus Reviews</b>"The journey from China to the United States and the experience on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay are fraught with anxiety and peril for 12-year-old Wang Lee. In order to gain admittance, he takes the "paper son" name Fu Lee, taking the place of someone whose records had burnt in the 1906 earthquake and fire. If he does not pass the examination on Angel Island (the Ellis Island of the West), he will be returned to China. Like many hopeful emigrants, he has carefully memorized each small detail in a "coaching book": the number of windows in "his" house, its location vis-�-vis neighbors and other minutiae of another family's home in China. The entire experience is expensive and traumatic, and waiting in the barracks on Angel Island is tiresome, strange and frightening, all at once. To lose family, name and everything else that one knows takes a brave person, desperate for the opportunity that&nbsp;<i>Gum Saam&nbsp;can provide. Fu Lee meets these demands in a book that clearly shows the boy and his fears and hopes. Ong's paintings of place and persons make the journey, setting and experience come alive. Backmatter on Angel Island provides historical context. An effective and empathetic depiction of the Angel Island experience.&nbsp;<i>(Picture book. 8-12)"</i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i><i></i></i><i><i></i></i><i><i><i></i></i></i><i><i><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>School Library Journal</b>"Gr 1-4--Lee, 12, lives with his grandparents. His parents have died, but it was their wish that he go to America for better opportunities. In 1926, conditions are difficult in China, and the boy's loving grandparents sadly agree that leaving would be the best thing for him. Immigration laws restrict Chinese people from entering the United States, so Lee's family purchased a "paper son" slot for him. A Chinese man already living in America will say that Lee is his son to get him into the country. As Wang Lee becomes Fu Lee, he must learn minute details about his new family in order to pass the interrogations at the Angel Island Immigration Station. While often called the "Ellis Island" of the west, Angel Island was often about stopping immigrants rather than welcoming them. People could spend weeks, months, or even years there, waiting to pass the tests or appealing deportation rulings. Since being a "paper son" was illegal, secrecy was paramount. The story concentrates on Lee's feelings about traveling alone to America, staying on Angel Island, and navigating the questioning. Failure would mean deportation, giving up the chance to help his grandparents, and losing the money his family paid. Large-scale illustrations, full-page and two-page bleeds, realistically portray the time and place and will help young readers with context. The authors provide a helpful summary of Angel Island history. Use with Milly Lee's Landed (Farrar, 2006) and Laurence Yep's Dragon Child (HarperCollins, 2008) to give young readers a fascinating glimpse into this elusive chapter of American history."--Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i></i></p><h2>The Chief Culprit: Stalin&#39;s Grand Design to Start World War II</h2><p>Bestselling author Victor Suvorov probes newly released Soviet documents and reevaluates existing material to analyze Stalin's strategic design to conquer Europe and the reasons behind his controversial support for Nazi Germany. A former Soviet army intelligence officer, the author explains that Stalin's strategy leading up to World War II grew from Vladimir Lenin's belief that if World War I did not ignite the worldwide Communist revolution, then a second world war would be needed to achieve it. Stalin saw Nazi Germany as the power that would fight and weaken capitalist countries so that Soviet armies could then sweep across Europe. Suvorov reveals how Stalin conspired with German leaders to bypass the Versailles Treaty, which forbade German rearmament, and secretly trained German engineers and officers and provided bases and factories for war. He also calls attention to the 1939 nonaggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany that allowed Hitler to proceed with his plans to invade Poland, fomenting war in Europe.<br><p>Suvorov debunks the theory that Stalin was duped by Hitler and that the Soviet Union was a victim of Nazi aggression. Instead, he makes the case that Stalin neither feared Hitler nor mistakenly trusted him. Suvorov maintains that after Germany occupied Poland, defeated France, and started to prepare for an invasion of Great Britain, Hitler's intelligence services detected the Soviet Union's preparations for a major war against Germany. This detection, he argues, led to Germany's preemptive war plan and the launch of an invasion of the USSR. Stalin emerges from the pages of this book as a diabolical genius consumed by visions of a worldwide Communist revolution at any cost--a leader who wooed Hitler and Germany in his own effort to conquer the world. In contradicting traditional theories about Soviet planning, the book is certain to provoke debate among historians throughout the world.</p></p><p>Viktor Suvorov is the author of eighteen books that have been translated into more than twenty languages, including <i>Inside the Aquarium: The Making of a Top Soviet Spy</i> and <i>Icebreaker: Who Started the Second World War?</i> A Soviet army officer who served in military intelligence, he defected in 1978 to the United Kingdom, where he worked as an intelligence analyst and lecturer. He lives in England."A provocative study...compelling...A highly controversial study, Suvorov's book is nevertheless well researched and warrants further examination into this critical period in the history of the war." <b><i>-- War in History</i></b></p><h2>The Mystery of the Missing Cat (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>The Aldens search for a lost cat in Greenfield.

THEY WERE HIDDEN between the pages of one of his books and came tumbling out and fell to the floor. I had known about the letters for years, but neither Bill nor Violet had ever told me what was in them. What they did tell me was that minutes after reading the fifth and last letter, Bill changed his mind about his marriage to Lucille, walked out the door of the building on Greene Street, and headed straight for Violet's apartment in the East Village. When I held the letters in my hands, I felt they had the uncanny weight of things enchanted by stories that are told and retold and then told again. My eyes are bad now, and it took me a long time to read them, but in the end I managed to make out every word. When I put the letters down, I knew that I would start writing this book today."While I was lying on the floor in the studio," she wrote in the fourth letter, "I watched you while you painted me. I looked at your arms and your shoulders and especially at your hands while you worked on the canvas. I wanted you to turn around and walk over to me and rub my skin the way you rubbed the painting. I wanted you to press hard on me with your thumb the way you pressed on the picture, and I thought that if youdidn't, I would go crazy, but I didn't go crazy, and you never touched me then, not once. You didn't even shake my hand."I first saw the painting Violet was writing about twenty-five years ago in a gallery on Prince Street in SoHo. I didn't know either Bill or Violet at the time. Most of the canvases in the group show were thin minimalist works that didn't interest me. Bill's painting hung alone on a wall. It was a large picture, about six feet high and eight feet long, that showed a young woman lying on the floor in an empty room. She was propped up on one elbow, and she seemed to be looking at something beyond the edge of the painting. Brilliant light streamed into the room from that side of the canvas and illuminated her face and chest. Her right hand was resting on her pubic bone, and when I moved closer, I saw that she was holding a little taxi in that hand--a miniature version of the ubiquitous yellow cab that moves up and down the streets of New York.It took me about a minute to understand that there were actually three people in the painting. Far to my right, on the dark side of the canvas, I noticed that a woman was leaving the picture. Only her foot and ankle could be seen inside the frame, but the loafer she was wearing had been rendered with excruciating care, and once I had seen it, I kept looking back at it. The invisible woman became as important as the one who dominated the canvas. The third person was only a shadow. For a moment I mistook the shadow for my own, but then I understood that the artist had included it in the work. The beautiful woman, who was wearing only a man's T-shirt, was being looked at by someone outside the painting, a spectator who seemed to be standing just where I was standing when I noticed the darkness that fell over her belly and her thighs.To the right of the canvas I read the small typed card: <i>Self-Portrait</i> by William Wechsler. At first I thought the artist was joking, but then I changed my mind. Did that title next to a man's name suggest a feminine part of himself or a trio of selves? Maybe the oblique narrative of two women and a viewer referred directly to the artist, or maybe the title didn't refer to the content of the picture at all, but to its form. The hand that had painted the picture hid itself in some parts of the painting andmade itself known in others. It disappeared in the photographic illusion of the woman's face, in the light that came from the invisible window, and in the hyperrealism of the loafer. The woman's long hair, however, was a tangle of heavy paint with forceful dabs of red, green, and blue. Around the shoe and the ankle above it, I noticed thick stripes of black, gray, and white that may have been applied with a knife, and in those dense strokes of pigment I could see the marks left by a man's thumb. It looked as if his gesture had been sudden, even violent.That painting is here in the room with me. When I turn my head I can see it, although it too has been altered by my failing eyesight. I bought it from the dealer for $2,500 about a week after I saw it. Erica was standing only a few feet away from where I am sitting now when she first looked at the canvas. She examined it calmly and said, "It's like looking at another person's dream, isn't it?"When I turned to the picture after Erica spoke, I saw that its mixed styles and shifting focus did remind me of the distortions in dreams. The woman's lips were parted, and her two front teeth protruded slightly. The artist had made them shiny white and a little too long, almost like an animal's. It was then that I noticed a bruise just below her knee. I had seen it before, but at that moment its purple cast, which was yellow-green at one edge, pulled my eyes toward it, as if this little wound were really the subject of the painting. I walked over, put my finger on the canvas, and traced the outline of the bruise. The gesture aroused me. I turned to look at Erica. It was a warm September day, and her arms were bare. I bent over her and kissed the freckles on her shoulders, then lifted the hair off her neck and kissed the soft skin underneath it. Kneeling in front of her, I pushed up the material of her skirt, ran my fingers along her thighs, and then I used my tongue. Her knees bent slightly toward me. She pulled down her underpants, tossed them onto the sofa with a grin, and pushed me gently backward onto the floor. Erica straddled me and her hair fell forward onto my face as she kissed me. Then she sat back, pulled off her T-shirt, and removed her bra. I loved that view of my wife. I touched her breasts and let my finger circle a perfectly round mole on the left one, before she leaned over me again. She kissed myforehead and cheeks and chin and then began fumbling with the zipper of my pants.In those days, Erica and I lived in a state of almost constant sexual excitement. Just about anything could spark off a session of wild grappling on the bed, the floor, and, once, on the dining room table. Since high school, girlfriends had come and gone in my life. I had had brief affairs and longer ones, but always there had been gaps between them--painful stretches of no women and no sex. Erica said that suffering had made me a better lover--that I didn't take a woman's body for granted. On that afternoon, however, we made love because of the painting. I have often wondered since why the image of a sore on a woman's body should have been erotic to me. Later, Erica said that she thought my response had something to do with a desire to leave a mark on another person's body. "Skin is soft," she said. "We're easily cut and bruised. It's not like she looks beaten or anything. It's an ordinary little black-and-blue mark, but the way it's painted makes it stick out. It's like he loved doing it, like he wanted to make a little wound that would last forever."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Erica was thirty-four years old then. I was eleven years older than that, and we had been married for a year. We'd literally bumped into each other in Butler Library at Columbia. It was late on a Saturday morning in October, and the stacks were mostly empty. I had heard her steps, had felt her presence behind the dim rows of books illuminated by a timed light that gave off a low humming sound. I found the book I was looking for and walked toward the elevator. Except for the lamp, I heard nothing. I turned the corner and tripped over Erica, who had seated herself on the floor at the end of the stack. I managed to keep my footing, but my glasses sailed off my face. She picked them up, and as I bent over to take them from her, she began to stand up and her head knocked against my chin. When she looked at me, she was smiling: "A few more like that, and we might have something going--a regular slapstick routine."I had fallen over a pretty woman. She had a wide mouth and thick dark hair cropped to her chin. The narrow skirt she was wearing hadmoved up her legs in our collision, and I glanced at her thighs as she tugged at her hem. After adjusting her skirt, she looked up at me and smiled again. During the second smile, her bottom lip quivered for an instant, and I took that small sign of nervousness or embarrassment to mean that she was susceptible to an invitation. Without it, I'm quite sure I would have apologized again and walked away. But that momentary tremor in her lip, gone in a moment, exposed a softness in her character and offered me a glimpse of what I guessed was her carefully guarded sensuality. I asked her to have coffee with me. Coffee turned into lunch, and lunch into dinner, and the following morning I was lying next to Erica Stein in the bed of my old apartment on Riverside Drive. She was still sleeping. The light came through the window and illuminated her face and hair. Very carefully I put my hand on her head. I left it there for several minutes while I looked at her and hoped she would stay.By then we had talked for hours. It turned out that Erica and I came from the same world. Her parents were German Jews who left Berlin as teenagers in 1933. Her father became a prominent psychoanalyst and her mother a voice teacher at Juilliard. The Steins were both dead. They died within months of each other the year before I met Erica, which was the same year my mother died: 1973. I was born in Berlin and lived there for five years. My memories of that city are fragmentary, and some may be false, images and stories I shaped from what my mother told me about my early life. Erica was born on the Upper West Side, where I ended up after spending three years in a Hampstead flat in London. It was Erica who prompted me to leave the West Side and my comfortable Columbia apartment. Before we married, she told me she wanted to "emigrate." When I asked her what she meant, she said that it was time for her to sell her parents' apartment on West Eighty-second Street and take the long subway ride downtown. "I smell death up here," she said, "and antiseptic and hospitals and stale Sacher torte. I have to move." Erica and I left the familiar ground of our childhoods and staked out new turf among the artists and bohemians farther south. We used the money we had inherited from our parents and moved to a loft on Greene Street between Canal and Grand.The new neighborhood with its empty streets, low buildings, and young tenants freed me from bonds I had never thought of as constraints. My father died in 1947, when he was only forty-three years old, but my mother lived on. I was their only child, and after my father was gone, my mother and I shared his ghost. My mother grew old and arthritic, but my father remained young and brilliant and promising--a doctor who might have done anything. That anything became everything for my mother. For twenty-six years she lived in the same apartment on Eighty-fourth Street between Broadway and Riverside with my father's missing future. Every once in a while, when I was first teaching, a student would refer to me as "Dr. Hertzberg" rather than "Professor," and I would inevitably think of my father. Living in SoHo didn't erase my past or induce forgetfulness, but when I turned a corner or crossed a street, there were no reminders of my displaced childhood and youth. Erica and I were both the children of exiles from a world that has disappeared. Our parents were assimilated middle-class Jews for whom Judaism was a religion their great-grandparents had practiced. Before 1933 they had thought of themselves as "Jewish Germans," a phrase that no longer exists in any language.When we met, Erica was an assistant professor in English at Rutgers, and I had already been teaching at Columbia in the art history department for twelve years. My degree came from Harvard, hers from Columbia, which explained why she was wandering in the stacks that Saturday morning with an alumni pass. I had fallen in love before, but in almost every case I had arrived at a moment of fatigue and boredom. Erica never bored me. She sometimes irritated and exasperated me, but she never bored me. Erica's comment about Bill's self-portrait was typical of her--simple, direct, and penetrating. I never condescended to Erica.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I had walked past 89 Bowery many times without ever stopping to look at it. The run-down, four-story brick building between Hester and Canal had never been more than the humble quarters of a wholesale business,but those days of modest respectability were long over by the time I arrived to visit William Wechsler. The windows of what had once been a storefront were boarded up, and the heavy metal door at street level was gouged and dented, as if somebody had attacked it with a hammer. A man with a beard and a drink in a paper bag was lounging on the single front step. He grunted in my direction when I asked him to move and then half-rolled, half-slid off the step.My first impressions of people are often clouded by what I come to know about them later, but in Bill's case, at least one aspect of those first seconds remained throughout our friendship. Bill had glamour--that mysterious quality of attraction that seduces strangers. When he met me at the door, he looked almost as disheveled as the man on the front step. He had a two-day beard. His thick black hair bushed out from the top and sides of his head, and his clothes were covered with dirt as well as paint. And yet when he looked at me, I found myself pulled toward him. His complexion was very dark for a white man, and his clear green eyes had an Asiatic tilt to them. He had a square jaw and chin, broad shoulders, and powerful arms. At six-two, he seemed to tower over me even though I couldn't have been more than a few inches shorter. I later decided that his almost magical appeal had something to do with his eyes. When he looked at me, he did so directly and without embarrassment, but at the same time I sensed his inwardness, his distraction. Although his curiosity about me seemed genuine, I also felt that he didn't want a thing from me. Bill gave off an air of autonomy so complete, it was irresistible."I took it for the light," he said to me when we walked through the door of the loft space on the fourth floor. Three long windows at the far end of the single room were shining with the afternoon sun. The building had sagged, which meant the back of the place was considerably lower than the front. The floor had warped as well, and as I looked toward the windows, I noticed bulges in the boards like shallow waves on a lake. The high end of the loft was spare, furnished only with a stool, a table constructed from two sawhorses and an old door, and stereo equipment, surrounded by hundreds of records and tapes in plastic milkcrates. Rows of canvases had been stacked against the wall. The room smelled strongly of paint, turpentine, and must.All the necessities for daily life had been crowded into the low end. A table knocked up against an old claw-foot bathtub. A double bed had been placed near a table, not far from a sink, and the stove protruded from an opening in an enormous bookcase crammed with books. There were also books piled in stacks on the floor beside it, and dozens more on an armchair that looked as if it hadn't been sat on in years. The chaos of the loft's living quarters revealed not only Bill's poverty but his obliviousness to the objects of domestic life. Time would make him richer, but his indifference to things never changed. He remained curiousl...</p><h2>Insects of the North Woods (Naturalist Series)</h2><p>Insects of the North Woods will help you identify more than 300 species of six-legged critters native to Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Adams uses self-deprecating humor, entertaining anecdotes, and frank descriptions to introduce anyone who "just doesn't get" Alcoholics Anonymous to the complete "Undrunk" lifestyle.<br> <br>Beginning with the story of his first AA meeting, he takes the mystery out what goes on behind closed doors, dispelling misconceptions of AA as cultlike, secretive, campy, or lowbrow. He then presents a user-friendly history and introduction to AA, explaining the Steps, Traditions, terms, and sayings--all punctuated by honest, often hilarious descriptions of his own struggles and eventual transformation to "getting" the program.</p><p>A. J. Adams is a professional writer and a member of AA. In keeping with the 11th Tradition, the author has chosen to use a pseudonym in place of his real name. Adams lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Starred Review. Until he bottomed out and joined up as a last-ditch effort, Adams thought of Alcoholics Anonymous (like many pre-treatment addicts) as a repository for losers or the weak. In this touching, semi-irreverent look at a global fellowship at once transparent and mysterious, Adams lays out the &#34;12 Steps&#34; for readers as he chronicles his own introduction to the program. The distinguishing characteristic of this memoir is Adams&#39;s skepticism and willingness to analyze the process, maintaining enough distance to translate the story for non-members while holding dear his conviction in AA&#39;s power to heal (in her foreword, Mel B. notes that &#34;one of AA&#39;s unwritten rules... is that one should utilize the program rather than analyze it&#34;). Adams includes a smattering of the organization&#39;s history and personal revelations, plenty of stories and much translation from AA jargon. Adams maintains a welcoming balance of candor and gallows humor with helpful explication and unflinching awareness of the life-and-death stakes, making this an eye-opening and encouraging read for those who need help with addiction, their own or a loved one&#39;s.</p><h2>Moonbeams, Dumplings &amp; Dragon Boats: A Treasury of Chinese Holiday Tales, Activities &amp; Recipes</h2><p>Filled with delectable recipes, hands-on family activities, and traditional tales to read aloud, this extraordinary collection will inspire families everywhere to re-create the magic of Chinese holidays in their own homes.

She lives in the Shetland Islands, UK.Grade 4-7-This book features five holidays: Chinese New Year and the Lantern Festival, Qing Ming, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival. Each section begins with a one-page description of the history and customs of the festival and is followed by a four- to six-page story, from one to three recipes, and two or three crafts or games. The headings on each page appear in both English typeface and Chinese calligraphy; a guide to Chinese pronunciation is included. The ample white space surrounding the text is filled with small, whimsical watercolor illustrations. Each of the four sections is introduced by a dynamic, detailed watercolor painting on a double-page spread. They include a dragon parade complete with fireworks, kites flying above a family honoring ancestors at a grave, a dragon boat race, and preparations for a moon ceremony. A two-page resource section is divided into three parts: of interest to adults, of interest to young readers, and Internet sources. Most books for young readers about Chinese holidays stress Chinese New Year; only two others feature the full range of annual festivals. Carol Stepanchuk's Red Eggs &amp; Dragon Boats (Pacific View, 1994) is a shorter book with a similar scope, but fewer recipes and crafts/activities. Judith Karen Gee's A Book of Chinese Festivals (Steam RR, 1989; o.p.) offers a brief description of each holiday but no recipes or other activities.

H. Auden&#x2019;s birth, the Modern Library offers this elegant edition of the collected poems of one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. <br><br>This volume includes all the poems that Auden wished to preserve, in a text that includes his final revisions, with corrections based on the latest research. Auden divided his poems into sections that corresponded to what he referred to as chapters in his life, each one beginning with a change in his inner life or external circumstances: the moment in 1933 when he first knew &#x201c;exactly what it means to love one&#x2019;s neighbor as oneself&#x201d;; his move from Britain to America in 1939; his first summer in Italy in 1948; his move to a summerhouse in Austria in 1958; and his return to England in 1972. <br><br>Auden&#x2019;s work has perhaps the widest range and the greatest depth of any English poet of the past three centuries. From the anxious warnings of his early verse through the expansive historical perspectives of his middle years to the celebrations and thanksgiving in his later work, Auden wrote in a voice that addressed readers personally rather than as part of a collective audience. His styles and forms extend from ballads and songs to haiku and limericks to sonnets, sestinas, prose poems, and dozens of other constructions of his own invention. His tone ranges from spirited comedy to memorable profundity&#x2013;often within the same work. His poems manage to be secular and sacred, philosophical and erotic, personal and universal. <br> <br>&#x201c;All the poems I have written were written for love,&#x201d; Auden once said. This book includes his famous early poems about transient love (&#x201c;Lay your sleeping head, my love,&#x201d; &#x201c;Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone&#x201d;) and his later poems about enduring love (&#x201c;In Sickness and in Health,&#x201d; &#x201c;First Things First&#x201d;). The book also includes Auden&#x2019;s longer, more thematically varied poems, from the expressionist charade &#x201c;Paid on Both Sides&#x201d; to the formal couplets of &#x201c;New Year Letter&#x201d;; the darkly comic sequel to The Tempest, &#x201c;The Sea and the Mirror&#x201d;; and a baroque eclogue set in a wartime bar, &#x201c;The Age of Anxiety.&#x201d; <br><br>This new edition includes a critical appreciation of Auden by Edward Mendelson, the editor of the present volume and Auden&#x2019;s literary executor.<br><br>&#x201c;W. H. Auden had the greatest gifts of any of our poets in the twentieth century, the greatest lap full of seed.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;James Fenton, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;At the beginning of the new century, [Auden] is an indispensable poet. Even people who don&#x2019;t read poems often turn to poetry at moments when it matters, and Auden matters now.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Adam Gopnik, <i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>Between 1927 and his death in 1973, W. H. Auden endowed poetry in the English language with a new face. Or rather, with several faces, since his work ranged from the political to the religious, from the urbane to the pastoral, from the mandarin to the invigoratingly plain-spoken. <br>This collection presents all the poems Auden wished to preserve, in the texts that received his final approval. It includes the full contents of his previous collected editions along with all the later volumes of his shorter poems. Together, these works display the astonishing range of Auden's voice and the breadth of his concerns, his deep knowledge of the traditions he inherited, and his ability to recast those traditions in modern times.W. H. Auden was born in York, England, in 1907. His first book of poems was published in 1930, followed by a dozen volumes of shorter and longer poems. He collaborated on three plays with Christopher Isherwood and wrote books about his travels to Iceland (with Louis MacNeice) and wartime China (with Christopher Isherwood). In 1939 he settled in New York and became an American citizen in 1946. In collaboration with his companion Chester Kallman, he composed opera libretti for Igor Stravinsky, Hans Werner Henze, and Nicholas Nabokov. In 1972 Auden left his winter home in New York and returned to Oxford. He died in Vienna in 1973.</p><h2>One of Us: The Story of a Massacre in Norway -- and Its Aftermath</h2><p><p><b>One of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>'s Ten Best Books of 2015 and a <i>NYT</i> Bestseller</b><b>,</b><b> and now the basis for the Netflix film <i>22 July</i>, from acclaimed filmmaker Paul Greengrass</b></p><p>Widely acclaimed as a <b>masterpiece, �sne Seierstad&#x2019;s </b><b><i>One of Us</i> is essential reading </b><b>for a time when mass killings </b><b>are so grimly frequent.</b><br><b></b><br>On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik detonated a bomb outside the Norwegian prime minister's office in central Oslo, killing eight people. He then proceeded to a youth camp on the wooded island of Ut�ya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of the country's governing Labour Party. In <i>One of Us</i>, the journalist �sne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and its reverberations. How did Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become Europe's most reviled terrorist? How did he accomplish an astonishing one-man murder spree? And how did a famously peaceful and prosperous country cope with the slaughter of so many of its young?</p><p>As in her international bestseller<i> The Bookseller of Kabul</i>, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik's childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist, a successful entrepreneur, and then an Internet game addict and self-styled master warrior who believed he could save Europe from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik's victims, tracing their political awakenings, teenage flirtations and hopes, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Ut�ya and relates what happened there, we know both the killer and those he will kill. In the book's final act, Seierstad describes Breivik's tumultuous public trial. As Breivik took the stand and articulated his ideas, an entire country debated whether he should be deemed insane, and asked why a devastating sequence of police errors allowed one man to do so much harm.</p><p><i>One of Us</i> is at once a psychological study of violent extremism, a dramatic true crime procedural, and a compassionate inquiry into how a privileged society copes with homegrown evil.

The implications of neuromagic go beyond illuminating our behavior; early research points to new approaches for everything from the diagnosis of autism to marketing techniques and education. Fun and accessible, <i>Sleights of Mind</i> is "a tour through consciousness, attention, and deception via the marriage of professional magic and cognitive neuroscience" (Vanessa Schipani,<i> The Scientist</i>).</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen L. Macknik, Ph.D.</b>, is Director of the Laboratory of Behavioral Neurophysiology at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. <b>Susana Martinez-Conde, Ph.D.</b>, is Director of the Laboratory of Visual Neuroscience at BNI. <b>Sandra Blakeslee</b> is a regular contributor to "Science Times" at <i>The New York Times</i> who specializes in the brain sciences, and the author of several books.</p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>CLARKE'S THIRD LAW: "<i>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</i>"</p><p>NIVEN'S LAW: "<i>Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology.</i>"</p><p>AGATHA HETERODYNE ("GIRL GENIUS") PARAPHRASE OF NIVEN'S LAW: "<i>Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science!</i>"</p><p>Have you ever wondered how magic effects work? Coins materialize out of thin air. Cards move through a deck as if pulled by an invisible force. Beautiful women are cut in half. Spoons bend. Fish, elephants, even the Statue of Liberty disappear before your eyes. How does a mentalist actually read your mind? How can you not see the gorilla in the room? Really, how can someone catch a bullet in his teeth? <i>How do they do it?</i></p><p>Don't bother to ask a conjurer. When joining an organization of professional magicians, the initiate may be asked to take an oath: "As a magician I promise never to reveal the secret of any illusion to a nonmagician, unless that person also swears to uphold the magicians' oath. I promise never to perform any illusion for any nonmagician without first practicing the effect until I can do it well enough to maintain the illusion of magic." It is a code. A brotherhood. The magician who breaks this code risks being blackballed by his fellow magicians.</p><p>So what are we, a couple of muggles, doing writing a book on magic? Zipped lips aside, hasn't most everything about magic been revealed? Enter "magic" in the Amazon Books search box and 75,000 results pop up. Log in to YouTube and you can see just about every magic trick ever devised&#x2014;often demonstrated by darling seven-year-olds in their bedrooms with Mom or Dad wielding the videocam. Visit Craigslist and choose from myriad charming descriptions of local amateur magicians. What's left to say?</p><p>Actually, plenty. This is the first book ever written on the neuroscience of magic, or, if you will, <i>neuromagic</i>, a term we coined as we began our travels in the world of magic.[1] Much has been said about the history of magic, tricks of the trade, the latest props, and psychological responses to magical effects. But neuroscience probes more deeply. We want to pop the hood on your brain as you are suckered in by sleights of hand. We want to explain at a fundamental level why you are so thoroughly vulnerable to sleights of mind. We want you to see how deception is part and parcel of being human. That we deceive each other all the time. And that we survive better and use fewer brain resources while doing so because of the way our brains produce attention.</p><p>Like so much that happens in science, we fell into magic by accident. We are neuroscientists at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. The BNI is the oldest stand-alone neurological institute in the United States and currently the largest neurosurgical service in North America, performing more than six thousand craniotomies per year. Each of us runs a research laboratory in the institute. Stephen is director of the laboratory of behavioral neurophysiology. Susana is director of the laboratory of visual neuroscience. Incidentally, we are married. Both of us are primarily interested in how the brain, as a device that is made up of individual cells called neurons, can produce awareness, the feeling of our first-person experience.[2] Somehow, when neurons are hooked up to each other in specific circuits, awareness is achieved. It's the ultimate scientific question, and neuroscience is on the verge of answering it.</p><p>Our foray into illusions began a decade ago when, as young scientists seeking to make a name for ourselves, we tried to rustle up some public enthusiasm for our specialty of visual neuroscience. In 2005, after accepting faculty appointments at BNI, we organized the annual meeting of the European Conference on Visual Perception, which was held in Susana's hometown of A Coru�a, Spain. We wanted to showcase visual science in a new way that would intrigue the public and the media. We were fascinated with how science can explain something about the visual arts&#x2014;for example, Margaret Livingstone's work on why the Mona Lisa's smile is so ineffably enigmatic. We also knew that visual illusions are fundamentally important to understanding how the brain turns raw visual information into perception.</p><p>The idea we came up with was simple: we would create the Best Illusion of the Year contest. We asked the scientific and artistic communities to contribute new visual illusions and received more than seventy entries. The audience (a mixture of scientists, artists, and the public) viewed the ten best illusions and then chose the top three. The contest, now in its seventh year, has been a huge success. Our Internet audience doubles every year, and our Web site (http://illusionoftheyear.com) currently has about 5 million page views each year.</p><p>Because of our success with the illusion contest, the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness asked us to chair its 2007 annual conference. The ASSC is a society of neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers united in the aim to understand how conscious experience emerges from the interactions of mindless, individually nonconscious brain cells.</p><p>As our opening move, we proposed holding the conference in our hometown of Phoenix, but the association's board nixed that right away because the city is an inferno midyear. Instead, they suggested . . . Las Vegas. Hmmm. Las Vegas is every bit as blisteringly hot in June as Phoenix, and if you take the lap dancing, gambling, and showgirls into account it is probably several degrees hotter due to friction. So apparently our colleagues in consciousness studies were looking for a bit of real excitement to spice up their thought experiments.</p><p>So Vegas it was. We flew there in October 2005 to do some scouting. On the flight over we asked ourselves: How could we raise the visibility of consciousness research to the public? We didn't want to do another contest. The answer began to germinate the moment our plane dipped its wings on approach to the Las Vegas airport. Out the window we could see, all at once, the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, an erupting volcano, the Space Needle, the Sphinx, Camelot, and the Great Pyramid. Soon we were driving up and down the Strip, checking out hotels for our meeting space. We passed Aladdin's castle, the Grand Canal of Venice, and Treasure Island. It seemed too strange to be real. Then, bingo: the theme for our conference appeared. Festooned on billboards, taxicabs, and buses were huge images of magicians: Penn &amp; Teller, Criss Angel, Mac King, Lance Burton, David Copperfield. They stared out at us with mischievous eyes and beguiling smiles. And then it hit us that these tricksters were like scientists from Bizarro World&#x2014;doppelg�ngers who had outpaced us real scientists in their understanding of attention and awareness and had flippantly applied it to the arts of entertainment, pickpocketing, mentalism, and bamboozlement (as well as to unique and unsettling patterns of facial hair).</p><p>We knew as vision scientists that artists have made important discoveries about the visual system for hundreds of years, and visual neuroscience has gained a great deal of knowledge about the brain by studying their techniques and ideas about perception. It was painters rather than scientists who first worked out the rules of visual perspective and occlusion, in order to make pigments on a flat canvas seem like a beautiful landscape rich in depth. We realized now that magicians were just a different kind of artist: instead of form and color, they manipulated attention and cognition.</p><p>Magicians basically do cognitive science experiments for audiences all night long, and they may be even more effective than we scientists are in the lab. Now, before our in-boxes fill up with flames from angry colleagues, let us explain. Cognitive neuroscience experiments are strongly susceptible to the state of the observer. If the experimental subject knows what the experiment is about, or is able to guess it, or sometimes even if she incorrectly thinks she has figured it out, the data are often corrupted or impossible to analyze. Such experiments are fragile and clunky. Extraordinary control measures must be put in place to keep the experimental data pure.</p><p>Now compare this with magic shows. Magic tricks test many of the same cognitive processes we study, but they are incredibly robust. It doesn't matter in the slightest that the entire audience knows it is being tricked; it falls for each trick every time it is performed, show after show, night after night, generation after generation. We thought, if only we could be that deft and clever in the lab! If only we were half so skilled at manipulating attention and awareness, what advances we could make!</p><p>The idea rapidly took shape: we would bring scientists and magicians together so scientists could learn the magicians' techniques and harness their powers.</p><p>But there was just one problem: we were clueless about magic. We didn't know any magicians. Neither of us had ever even seen a real magic show. Fortunately, our colleague Daniel Dennett got us our big break. Dennett is a fellow scientist and philosopher who also happens to be a good friend of James the Amaz!ng Randi, a famous magician and skeptic who has spent decades debunking claims of the paranormal. Randi wrote back, enthusiastically endorsing our idea. He told us that he knew three more magicians who would be perfect for our purposes: Teller (from the magic duo Penn &amp; Teller), Mac King, and Johnny Thompson. All of them lived in Las Vegas and all were personally interested in cognitive science. Apollo Robbins, "the Gentleman Thief," a friend of Teller, joined our group a few months later. Much of this book is based on our interactions with these talented magicians.</p><p>Thus began our journey of discovery about the neural underpinnings of magic. We have spent the last few years traveling the world, me...</p></p><h2>Abandoned: A Novel (Max Revere Novels, 5)</h2><p><p><b>Max Revere returns in <i>New York Times </i>bestseller Allison Brennan's latest, on the heels of the first crossover with Lucy Kincaid. </b></p><p>Investigative reporter Max Revere has cracked many cases, but the one investigation she's never attempted is the mystery from her own past.

Here&nbsp;you&#x2019;re among friends.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&#x2019;re here to honor the young adult&nbsp;lit published after Judy Blume but before&nbsp;J. K. Rowling. These books often&nbsp;get a bad rap. People think of it as a&nbsp;time of superficial books about gossip,&nbsp;proms, and amnesia. But the YA novels&nbsp;that we hoarded from school book fairs&nbsp;taught us about female friendships,&nbsp;trusting ourselves, and speaking our&nbsp;minds&#x2014;while also feeding us questionable&nbsp;lessons about what it means&nbsp;to be a woman and whose stories deserve&nbsp;to be told.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know the nostalgic power of &#x2019;80s&nbsp;and &#x2019;90s young-adult lit firsthand. In&nbsp;the spring of 2016, I was in a major rut&nbsp;and decided there was only one way&nbsp;out: buying a crate of Sweet Valley&nbsp;High books on eBay. For the semi-reasonable&nbsp;price of $50, I could lose&nbsp;myself in the neon-tinted pop culture&nbsp;of my youth, with all its pointless catfights&nbsp;and ice-blue prom dresses.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I may have learned to read from educator-&nbsp;approved picture books about&nbsp;poky puppies and purple crayons, but I&nbsp;learned to become a<i> reader</i> from Sweet&nbsp;Valley High. In 1989, I begged my parents&nbsp;to buy me #32, <i>The New Jessica</i>,&nbsp;because I thought the girls on the cover&nbsp;had pretty hair. Little did I know that&nbsp;I&#x2019;d be injecting the adventures of those&nbsp;pretty-haired Wakefield twins directly&nbsp;into my veins for the next four years.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Sweet Valley, I&#x2019;d been a shy,&nbsp;unpopular dork. But after Sweet&nbsp;Valley, I was something much, much&nbsp;better: a shy, unpopular dork who could&nbsp;retreat into a pastel parallel universe.&nbsp;There, everyone had friends, everyone&nbsp;was pretty, and everyone was special.&nbsp;My peers were stuck engaging with&nbsp;reality like <i>morons</i>, but with a trip to&nbsp;the library, I could become a California&nbsp;beauty queen, or an angsty teen living&nbsp;on a haunted street, or a clever babysitter&nbsp;loved by kids and adults alike.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stopped reading tween lit in 1994,&nbsp;when I started middle school and became&nbsp;less interested in being elected&nbsp;prom queen and more interested in the&nbsp;prospect of burning down prom with&nbsp;my eerie telekinetic powers. But those&nbsp;books remained stuck in the back of&nbsp;my brain, and the slightest trigger&#x2014;a&nbsp;geometric-print sweater, an attractive&nbsp;blonde teenager pitching a fit&#x2014;brought&nbsp;back a rush of memories.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew they lingered there for some&nbsp;reason. But I didn&#x2019;t give myself permission&nbsp;to take a full-on journey into the&nbsp;past until that summer of existential&nbsp;dread. The books were a thirty-fourth&nbsp;birthday present to myself, and locking&nbsp;myself in my bedroom to devour a giant&nbsp;box of paperback novels from 1990 was&nbsp;a form of self-care that I thought would&nbsp;help me get my bearings. As I ripped&nbsp;through those books, I found more than&nbsp;nostalgia&#x2014;though Jesus H. Wakefield,&nbsp;did I find nostalgia! I also found a record&nbsp;of my adolescent expectations&#x2014;of&nbsp;the ideas about romance and womanhood&nbsp;and rebellion that had shaped me.&nbsp;I found the attitudes I&#x2019;d end up embracing,&nbsp;and resisting, my entire life.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After that first box, I picked up more&nbsp;and more tween series until I had so&nbsp;many that I could no longer play off&nbsp;my behavior as a joke. I had contracted&nbsp;a compulsive need to buy books from&nbsp;the pre-Twilight era of teen literature,&nbsp;the days when no adult would be&nbsp;caught dead reading YA on the subway.&nbsp;I realized that I needed to share what&nbsp;I&#x2019;d learned from rereading them and,&nbsp;more important, that I needed to justify&nbsp;spending so much money on Fear&nbsp;Street books instead of saving for a&nbsp;house.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That&#x2019;s the short version of how the&nbsp;book you are holding came to be. These&nbsp;are the stories that made us and, as I&nbsp;found out, the stories that can save&nbsp;us, even now. That alone makes them&nbsp;worth another look.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I have a&nbsp;Jungle Prom to ruin.<br><br>GIRL, YOU&#x2019;LL BE A YOUNG&nbsp;ADULT SOON<br> So where did the young adult literature&nbsp;boom of the &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s come from?&nbsp;Well, the story starts at the dawn of&nbsp;YA&#x2014;though experts don&#x2019;t agree on&nbsp;exactly when it dawned. Books from&nbsp;the original 1930s Nancy Drew stories&nbsp;to Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s 1932 book&nbsp;<i>Little House in the Big Woods</i> to the&nbsp;1936 novel <i>Sue Barton, Student Nurse</i>&nbsp;by Helen Dore Boylston have all been&nbsp;held up as the first-ever YA novel. But&nbsp;a critical mass of people, including&nbsp;YA expert and former Young Adult&nbsp;Library Services Association president&nbsp;Michael Cart, say that it all started&nbsp;with Maureen Daly&#x2019;s <i>Seventeenth&nbsp;Summer,</i> a tale of summer lovin&#x2019; published&nbsp;in 1942 that spoke directly to&nbsp;the hearts and wallets of postwar teen&nbsp;culture. <i>Seventeenth Summer</i> ushered&nbsp;in malt shop books, wholesome novels&nbsp;about teen girls who lived, loved, and&nbsp;never went past first base in an idealized&nbsp;America. Not long after, in 1944,&nbsp;New York Public Library librarian&nbsp;Margaret Scoggins changed the name&nbsp;of her <i>Library Journal</i> column on teen&nbsp;lit to &#x201c;Books for Young Adults.&#x201d; In 1957,&nbsp;the Young Adult Library Services&nbsp;Division of the American Library&nbsp;Association was founded. And in 1966,<br> the American Library Association&nbsp;changed the name of its list of books&nbsp;for a teenage reader to &#x201c;Best Books for&nbsp;Young Adults.&#x201d; YA as we know it had&nbsp;been officially christened.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The &#x2019;60s saw YA get serious. In 1967,&nbsp;S. E. Hinton&#x2019;s <i>The Outsiders</i>, a novel&nbsp;about young gangsters in Oklahoma&nbsp;who are into emotional introspection&nbsp;and stabbing each other, set off what&nbsp;some have called the &#x201c;first golden age&nbsp;of YA.&#x201d; Post-<i>Outsiders</i> YA channeled&nbsp;more of the zeitgeist of late &#x2019;60s and&nbsp;&#x2019;70s America, with authors like Judy&nbsp;Blume and Paul Zindel dramatizing&nbsp;previously forbidden topics like sexuality,&nbsp;drug use, and divorce.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it wasn&#x2019;t until 1985 that a YA&nbsp;series landed on the <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-seller list for the first time, thanks&nbsp;to Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield,&nbsp;those foxy blonde sociopaths first introduced&nbsp;by Francine Pascal in 1983&nbsp;(see page 104). They represented this&nbsp;new wave of YA, one that skipped&nbsp;narratives about teen trauma in favor&nbsp;of innocent romances that harkened&nbsp;back to the malt shop days, when girls&nbsp;were virgins, families were nuclear,&nbsp;and really bad stuff only happened to&nbsp;other people. These chaste romances&nbsp;created a brand-new revenue stream&nbsp;for publishers by getting the cash directly&nbsp;from the source: new marketing&nbsp;efforts allowed teens to bypass school&nbsp;or the library in favor of the mall&nbsp;bookstore.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Innovations in both sales technique&nbsp;and subject matter spread beyond teen&nbsp;romance, expanding, refreshing, and&nbsp;remarketing the YA worlds of suspense,&nbsp;drama, light comedy, and horror.&nbsp;Series like Baby-Sitters Club (page&nbsp;141) or Saddle Club (page 73) were&nbsp;aimed at an audience a bit too young to&nbsp;envy the Wakefield sisters their Fiat,&nbsp;and legacy series like Nancy Drew&nbsp;and the Boxcar Children marched on&nbsp;with &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s makeovers. &#x201c;Good&#x201d;&nbsp;books for younger readers&#x2014;the kind&nbsp;that teachers believed had literary&nbsp;value&#x2014;were still being published, but&nbsp;this period was the first time the market&nbsp;was flooded with quickly churnedout&nbsp;paperbacks for young women, with&nbsp;plots that felt more like sitcoms or soap&nbsp;operas than earnest after-school specials.&nbsp;These books generally stepped&nbsp;away from the socially aware vibe of&nbsp;&#x2019;70s YA, presenting stories of white,&nbsp;straight, thin, middle-to-upper-class&nbsp;heroines with few real problems. And&nbsp;like the &#x2019;50s teen novels they harkened&nbsp;back to, these books posited that following&nbsp;society&#x2019;s rules was the path to&nbsp;popularity and joy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book packages also looked different&nbsp;from those that came before and&nbsp;after. Though &#x2019;70s YA covers often&nbsp;featured subdued colors, &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s&nbsp;YA utilized perky pastels and neons.&nbsp;And though post&#x2013;Harry Potter YA&nbsp;was dominated by trilogies and thick,&nbsp;sleekly designed hardcovers, &#x2019;80s and&nbsp;&#x2019;90s YA publishers specialized in paperback&nbsp;series with roughly one billion&nbsp;flimsy volumes, following the heroines&#x2019;&nbsp;every move. Some YA series, like&nbsp;Gossip Girl, do carry the Wakefield&nbsp;torch&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re rare.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet no matter how fluffy, overmarketed,&nbsp;heteronormative, and vapid the&nbsp;books of the &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s may have&nbsp;been, they did more than fuel the key&nbsp;transition from the realist YA fiction&nbsp;of the &#x2019;70s to the sparkly YA fiction of&nbsp;the 2000s. (Though, I have to say, if&nbsp;you think Twilight invented sexy teen&nbsp;vampires, buckle up.). They helped&nbsp;turn us readers into the women we&nbsp;are today. Not because we embraced&nbsp;all the values the books implicitly&nbsp;endorsed, but because they gave us&nbsp;space to explore our identities, dream&nbsp;of the future, and, when the time came,&nbsp;engage in growth and rebellion by&nbsp;turning our backs on them. They validated&nbsp;girls&#x2019; stories by putting them to&nbsp;paper&#x2014;simple as that.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Does that make up for the fact that&nbsp;a lot of these books centered the stories&nbsp;of white rich thin heterosexual&nbsp;women with naturally straight hair?&nbsp;Of course not. These books were a&nbsp;mixed blessing, and for readers who&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t fit into the prescribed mold of&nbsp;the heroines, they were as alienating&nbsp;as they could be empowering. But their&nbsp;impact, and the way they shaped us&nbsp;into the protagonists of our own lives,&nbsp;is undeniable. They taught us that girls&nbsp;and girls&#x2019; experiences mattered, that&nbsp;things our parents or teachers thought&nbsp;were frivolous were in fact important&nbsp;enough to spend a book or ten teasing&nbsp;the meaning out of. They taught us&nbsp;that we should say hello to our friends,&nbsp;because there&#x2019;s nothing better than&nbsp;them. They taught us that there was&nbsp;light at the end of most tunnels, and,&nbsp;if nothing else worked out, you could&nbsp;start over in California.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All those hours spent signing up&nbsp;for library wait lists, or scouring the&nbsp;shelves at Waldenbooks, or reading&nbsp;when you were supposed to be learning&nbsp;long division, really did matter. These&nbsp;are the books that taught us, implicitly,&nbsp;that reading could be fun&#x2014;hell, that it&nbsp;should be fun! And the good lessons we&nbsp;learned from them are (mostly) worth&nbsp;remembering.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So come on in, friend. We&#x2019;ve got a&nbsp;Scholastic Book Fair circular with all&nbsp;the best ones circled just for you.</p><h2>Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity</h2><p><b>Winner of Randy Shilts Award</b><br><br>In the half century before the Nazis rose to power, Berlin became the undisputed gay capital of the world.

Since the beginning of the week, the Association of German Jurists had been assembling in this magnificent neoclassical structure to present papers and discuss the legal issues of the day. The professional group included lawyers, officials, bureaucrats, and legal academics from the thirty-�nine states and cities of the former German Confederation, a loose association created at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This imposing body of Ulrichs&#x2019;s colleagues made up the government establishment of the nascent German Empire. Dressed formally even in the midst of summer, they had first met in 1860 to facilitate great tasks of statecraft. As ardent nationalists, they hoped to promote German legal unification, even before the emergence of a nation-�state. Although the jurists&#x2019; political program would have important consequences for the incipient German state, Ulrichs&#x2019;s appearance at the Odeon marked a revolution all its own. He was preparing to address his professional colleagues on an unmentionable subject, same-�sex love, and to protest the various German anti-�sodomy laws that criminalized it.<br><br>Ulrichs had celebrated his birthday the day before, and now, at the age of forty-�two, he hoped to deliver a speech for which he arguably had spent most of his adulthood preparing. As a university student, he had recognized that he was attracted to other men. This sexual peculiarity and rumors of his intimate affairs had forced him to resign the only professional position he had ever held, as a government official. Finally, in an act of enormous courage, he disclosed his secret to his closest kin. Raised in a pious Christian family whose extended members included numerous Lutheran clergy, Ulrichs struggled for years with heart and intellect to make sense of his seemingly unacceptable feelings. Were they unnatural? Had he somehow caused them himself, through actions of his own? He examined carefully his own motivations and desires; he scoured legal and scientific publications on the topic. Following the tradition of the great Protestant reformer Martin Luther, Ulrichs countered prevailing beliefs and developed a theory of his own selfhood&#x2014;�though defined in sexual, not spiritual, terms&#x2014;�forming the conviction that he must face down an established authority and counter centuries of prejudice. To that end, since 1864, Ulrichs had published pamphlets under a pseudonym, arguing his case that sexual deviance was an endowment of nature and must be respected.<br><br>But on that morning in August, crossing Munich&#x2019;s imposing Odeonsplatz, framed by government and cultural buildings, past the grand loggia of the Field Marshals&#x2019; Hall and the baroque spires and dome of the Theatine Church, Ulrichs felt his heart palpitate almost audibly as he neared the Odeon hall. As he would later recount, an inner voice whispered, &#x201c;There is still time to keep silent. Simply waive your request to speak, and then your heart can stop pounding.&#x201d; But Ulrichs also remembered those &#x201c;comrades&#x201d; who were anticipating his protest&#x2014;�&#x201c;Was I to answer their trust in me with cowardice?&#x201d;&#x2014;�and he recalled a desperate acquaintance who had committed suicide to escape criminal pros�ecution for sodomy and the public humiliation that would have followed. &#x201c;With breast beating,&#x201d; Ulrichs entered the building, mounted the speaker&#x2019;s platform, and began reading his text to more than five hundred professional colleagues. &#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; he intoned, &#x201c;my proposal is directed toward a revision of the current penal law&#x201d; to abolish the persecution of an innocent class of persons. &#x201c;It is at the same time,&#x201d; Ulrichs continued, &#x201c;a question of damming a continuing flood of suicides.&#x201d; The victims, he said, were those sexually drawn to members of their own sex.<br><br>Expressions of outrage and scattered cries of &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; began echoing through the chamber. Alarmed by the voluble hostility, Ulrichs offered to surrender the floor, but others in the audience urged him to continue, and he again took heart. This &#x201c;class of persons,&#x201d; he went on to say, suffered legal persecution only because &#x201c;nature has planted in them a sexual nature that is opposite of that which is usual.&#x201d; Raucous shouts now emanated from the audience; Ulrichs heard hooting, catcalls, and cries of &#x201c;Crucify!&#x201d; from groups on his left and directly in front. On his right stood those who were not prepared for the content of his address and out of curiosity demanded that he finish. But the cacophony overwhelmed Ulrichs and forced him to descend from the podium without finishing his speech, while the assembly chairman attempted to reestablish order. The Association of Jurists refused to press Ulrichs&#x2019;s agenda after the meeting concluded. Within five years member states of the new German Empire had adopted a full penal code in which the punitive Prussian law making a crime of sodomy prevailed over the far more liberal statutes of the other German states. But standing at the podium in Munich, Ulrichs had started something important with the first public coming-�out in modern history.<br><br>Just how much courage did this take? By August 1867 Ulrichs had already forfeited his career and exposed himself to potential rejection by family members. He had little left to lose and later described his appearance before the jurists at the Odeon as the proudest moment of his life. Freed now to go on making a public case for his cause, he continued publishing pamphlets after 1867, but under his own name, not a pseu�donym. And although he failed to avert the imposition of an anti-�sodomy law throughout the newly unified German nation after 1871, his writings and actions helped inspire the world&#x2019;s first movement for homosexual rights, launched a generation later in Berlin, in 1897.<br><br>The truly remarkable aspect of Ulrichs&#x2019;s brave initiative was the important contribution he made to the redefinition&#x2014;�indeed the invention&#x2014;�of sexuality (and homosexuality) in nineteenth-�century Europe. Traditional medical &#x201c;science&#x201d; explained &#x201c;sodomy&#x201d; as a willful perversion and the product of masturbation or sexual excess. &#x201c;Sodomites&#x201d; were understood to be oversexed predators who had simply grown bored with women. The established science of sexual &#x201c;perversion&#x201d; viewed same-�sex erotic activity as that which it seemed to be and nothing more, an isolated genital act. It was possible to imagine, in fact, that almost anyone might succumb to the crime of sodomy, either through seduction or by willful decision, but ultimately as a result of moral weakness. Sexual desire was considered a fluid and malleable drive that might easily be warped and perverted. Only in the 1850s did the first medical doctor, a German in Berlin named Johann Ludwig Casper, question this received wisdom and argue that some &#x201c;sodomites&#x201d; had an innate, biological attraction to the same sex. By 1900 a progressive school of German psychiatry had formed around the belief that same-�sex attraction might be congenital, and somehow an integral feature of a small sexual minority. It became possible now to imagine that certain individuals were attracted innately to their own and not the opposite sex. Indeed, German speakers&#x2014;�both self-�identified same-�sex-�loving men and medical doctors&#x2014;�invented a new language of sexual orientation and identity that displaced the older understanding of perversion and moral failure. Invented terms such as Urning (Ulrichs&#x2019;s own coinage) or &#x201c;homosexual&#x201d; first entered the German lexicon and later other European languages as well. Ulrichs&#x2019;s pamphlet propaganda played a critical role in this development: his theories of an inborn Urning sexuality and character coupled with his outspoken activism helped not only to influence the incipient sciences of sexuality but also to mobilize an imagined community of homosexuals. Concretely, Ulrichs spearheaded a conceptual revolution that transformed erotic, same-�sex love from one of deviant acts into a full-�blown sexual orientation with its own distinct quality and character.<br><br>Ulrichs was an improbable innovator, and certainly an unlikely activist for the civil rights of a sexual minority. Born in 1825 in Aurich, a typical small-�town German community located in East Friesland, which became part of the kingdom of Hanover in 1815, the young Ulrichs was sheltered from the cultural and intellectual life of nineteenth-�century Europe. His father was a district engineering official and civil servant, and his mother&#x2019;s clan included numerous Lutheran pastors. From infancy, Ulrichs&#x2019;s conservative family trained him for academic study and a professional career, either as a bureaucrat or a clergyman. This early preparation endowed him with a restless intelligence, however, and the independence to follow his own calling.<br><br>Ulrichs&#x2019;s family must be seen as elite&#x2014;�despite its small-�town ori- gins&#x2014;�and typical of a wider German class of educated professionals, Bildungsb�rgertum, a group that enjoyed significant social prominence throughout the German territories. What anchored their elite status was education: most attended Gymnasium, the Latin high school that prepared its graduates for university study. Talent was a necessary but rarely sufficient qualification for Gymnasium. Germany&#x2019;s educated elite shared a class background of social and cultural&#x2014;�if not financial&#x2014;�capital, provided by families that could prepare sons for rigorous training and the connections to navigate social and government networks. Higher education was the credential that guaranteed a civil service career as jurist, teacher, cleric, or official in any one of Germany&#x2019;s city, state, or church bureaucracies. Many such families boasted a long string of church or state officials, often stretching back generations. The Ulrichs family was no exception.<br><br>As his parents&#x2019; only surviving son&#x2014;�an older brother died in infancy in 1824&#x2014;�Ulrichs enjoyed the attention and encouragement that prepared him well for academic study. He later described this as a happy childhood: &#x201c;From loving motherly care, I received in part my first education and in part a whole series of other intellectual impressions and influences.&#x201d; Ulrichs&#x2019;s mother also imparted the conservative piety of traditional Lutheranism, teaching her son devotional exercises, scripture, and prayers. After the death of his father in 1835, Ulrichs and his family moved to live near his maternal grandfather and a married sister in the Hanoverian town of Burgdorf, where he was confirmed in the Lutheran Church by his grandfather on Easter Sunday in 1839, a religious and social milestone marking a new stage of his life. Young Karl then attended Gymnasium, first in Detmold, home of his mother&#x2019;s brother (likewise a Lutheran pastor), and then in nearby Celle. The close structure of Ulrichs&#x2019;s family&#x2014;�infused with conservative Protestant religiosity, loving attention, and careful social control&#x2014;�served the boy well. At nineteen he completed his Gymnasium exams with excellent results in Latin and Greek, the subjects required for university entrance.<br><br>That fall, he began legal studies at the University of G�ttingen. Founded in 1734 by George II, ruler of Hanover and also king of Great Britain, G�ttingen was just one of the twenty-�odd German institutions of higher learning established before 1800. Unlike the centralized states of England and France, which had no more than a handful of universities at this time, the semi-�sovereign states of the Holy Roman Empire maintained their independence, both culturally and&#x2014;�to some extent&#x2014;�politically. The size and character of these territories varied tremendously, and counting the tiny estates of the imperial knights numbered above eighteen hundred. The largest, including Brandenburg-�Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, and W�rttemberg, often had the trappings of sovereign states. Since the High Middle Ages, the rulers of these largest German territories founded universities in their competition for cultural distinction and to train those who served in state and city bureaucracies. This political fragmentation also explains best the tradition of a Bildungsb�rgertum in German central Europe: the many small and medium-�sized states, each with its own princely court and administrative bureaucracy, required both literate staff and the institutions to educate them. Ulrichs was fortunate to live in the Hanoverian kingdom, since G�ttingen had established itself very quickly as one of the premier German universities. The law faculty was particularly prominent and trained numerous statesman and scholars, including Austrian prime minister Clemens von Metternich; Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin in 1810; and Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of the German Empire when it was formed in 1871. By the first decades of the twentieth century, more than twenty-�five Nobel laureates had G�ttingen affiliations, either as onetime students or professors.<br><br>It was as a student at G�ttingen that Ulrichs first identified the issues that would inspire him to take up his activism. He identified his own sexual peculiarity, and also embraced the ideal of gro�deutsch, or greater German, statehood, a nationalist ideology that promoted the idea of a unified German state that would incorporate all German speakers, including denizens of Austria and the Habsburg crownlands. Although these two strands of political action were seemingly unconnected, Ulrichs&#x2019;s human rights activism and his nationalism were curiously intertwined. By promoting &#x201c;greater German&#x201d; statehood, Ulrichs hoped to counter the influence of Prussia, and, in turn, the likelihood that Prussia&#x2019;s anti-�sodomy statute might be imposed on the other German territories.<br><br>After five semesters in G�ttingen, Ulrichs transferred to the University of Berlin, where he studied for one year. His decision to move was on its face of no particular note; many German students attended several universities before taking a degree. Ulrichs had a special motive, however, for coming to Berlin. In his second year at G�ttingen, he had become self-�consciously aware of his attraction to men. As he divulged later in a family letter, &#x201c;Approximately half a year . . . before I went to Berlin, I was at a dance. . . . But among the dancers there were about twelve young, well-�developed and handsomely uniformed forestry pupils. Although at earlier dances no one caught my attention, I felt such a strong attraction that I was amazed. . . . I would have flung myself at them. When I retired after the ball, I suffered true anxieties in my bedroom, alone and unseen, solely preoccupied by memories of those handsome young men.&#x201d; Clearly this sexual awakening jolted the young Ulrichs, but it also underscored the loneliness he felt in G�ttingen. As far as he could see, there was no one else there like himself.<br><br>Ulrichs almost certainly had an awareness of Berlin&#x2019;s reputation. With a population of nearly 400,000, the city was bound to be more exciting than the sedate university town of G�ttingen. But there was something more specific. As a garrison city, Berlin had been known for its male prostitution since at least the eighteenth century. As early as 1782 one guidebook devoted a short chapter to Berlin&#x2019;s &#x201c;warm brothers&#x201d; and the prevalence of male prostitution as an income source for garrisoned soldiers. This reputation was well established by the time Ulrichs moved to the city.

While most of us picture caterpillars as cute fuzzballs munching on leaves, there is much more to them than we imagine. A caterpillar&#x2019;s survival hinges on finding enough food and defending itself from the array of natural enemies lined up to pounce and consume. And the astounding adaptations and strategies they have developed to maximize their chances of becoming a butterfly or moth are only just beginning to be understood, from the Spicebush Swallowtail caterpillar that resembles a small snake to the Eastern Carpenter Bee Hawkmoth caterpillar that attempts to dissuade potential predators by looking like a diseased leaf.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The Book of Caterpillars</i> unveils the mysteries of six hundred species from around the world, introducing readers to the complexity and beauty of these underappreciated insects. With the advent of high-quality digital macrophotography, the world of caterpillars is finally opening up. The book presents a wealth of stunning imagery that showcases the astonishing diversity of caterpillar design, structure, coloration, and patterning. Each entry also features a two-tone engraving of the adult specimen, emphasizing the wing patterns and shades, as well as a population distribution map and table of essential information that includes their habitat, typical host plants, and conservation status. Throughout the book are fascinating facts that will enthrall expert entomologists and curious collectors alike.<br> &nbsp;<br> A visually rich and scientifically accurate guide to six hundred of the world&#x2019;s most peculiar caterpillars, this volume presents readers with a rare, detailed look at these intriguing forms of insect life.&nbsp;</p><p><b>David G.

The 600 varieties represented here comprise a small fraction of 160,000 known species. Nevertheless, the cosmopolitan coverage of representative taxa does begin to capture the diversity of these insects while elucidating their lesser-known, immature forms. In a concise introduction, James defines caterpillars, their survival role, and how they contribute to the natural ecosystem, as well as the diverse ways in which humans interact with them. The bulk of the work consists of single-page species templates organized by family; these provide geographical distribution, habitat, host plants, notes, and conservation status, as well as a couple of informative paragraphs and a life-size color photograph of the caterpillar. Some species also are illustrated by a larger photograph that provides rich detail.

Lindsey lives in New Hampshire with her family.<b>Chapter One</b><p> </p><p> She'd been told to hide, and stay hidden. That had been Gabrielle Brooks's first thought as well after the noise had drawn her up to the deck and she'd seen what was causing the commotion. It wasn't the captain who'd given her the order, though. He'd been nothing but confident that he could lose the ship bearing down on them. He'd even laughed about it and shaken his fist at the Jolly Roger flying from the attacking ship's mainmast, which was visible now to the naked eye. His enthusiasm -- and dare she say delight? -- had certainly relieved her mind. Until the first mate pulled her aside and told her to hide. </p><p> Unlike the captain, Avery Dobs didn't appear eager for the upcoming confrontation. His complexion as white as the extra sails being swiftly hoisted by the crew, he hadn't been gentle about shoving her toward the stairs. </p><p> "Use one of the empty food barrels in the hold. There are many of them now. With any luck, the pirates won't open more than one or two, and finding them empty, they'll move on. I'll warn your servant to hide as well. Now go! And no matter what you hear, don't leave the hold until someone whose voice you recognize comes for you." </p><p> He hadn't said until <i>he</i> came for her. His panic was infectious, his roughness surprising. Her arm was probably bruised where he'd gripped it. It was such a change from the courteous way he had treated her when the journey began. He'd nearly been courting her, or so it had seemed, though that was unlikely. He was in his early thirties and she was barely out of the schoolroom. It was just his deferential manner, his gentle tone of voice, and the inordinate amount of attention he'd paid her during the three weeks since they'd left London, that gave her the impression he liked her more than he should. </p><p> He'd managed to instill his own fear in her, though, and she'd raced toward the bowels of the ship. It was easy to find the food barrels Avery had spoken of, nearly all of them empty, now that they were nearing their destination in the Caribbean. Another few days and they would have sailed into St. George's harbor in Grenada, her father's last known whereabouts, and she could have begun her search for him. </p><p> Nathan Brooks was not a man she knew well, though all her memories of him were fond ones, but he was all she had now that her mother had died. While she'd never once doubted that he loved her, he had never lived at home with her for any length of time. A month, maybe a few months at a time, and, one year, an entire summer -- but then several years would pass without a visit from him. Nathan was captain of his own merchantman with very profitable trade routes in the West Indies. He sent home money and extravagant presents, but rarely did he bring himself home. </p><p> He'd tried to move his family closer to where he worked, but Carla, Gabrielle's mother, wouldn't even consider it. England had been her home all of her life. She had no family left there, but all her friends were there, as well as everything she valued, and she had never approved of Nathan's seafaring occupation anyway. <i>Trade</i>. She'd always spoken the word in disgust. She had enough aristocracy in her ancestry, even if she bore no title herself, to look down on anyone in <i>trade</i>, even her own husband. </p><p> It was a wonder they'd ever married. They certainly didn't seem to like each other much when they were together. And Gabrielle would never, ever mention to him that his long absences had led Carla to take a...Well, she couldn't even bring herself to think the word, much less say it. She was so embarrassed by her own conclusions. But Albert Swift had been a regular visitor to their two-story cottage on the outskirts of Brighton during the last several years, and Carla had behaved like a young schoolgirl whenever he was in town. </p><p> When he'd stopped coming around and they heard the rumors that he was courting an heiress in London, Gabrielle's mother had undergone a remarkable change. Overnight, she turned into a bitter woman, hating the world and everything in it, crying over a man who wasn't even hers. </p><p> Whether he had made Carla promises, whether Carla had intended to divorce her husband, no one knew, but her heart seemed to have broken when Albert turned his attentions to another woman. She had all the signs of a woman betrayed, and when she took sick in early spring and her condition had worsened, she'd made no effort to recover from it, ignoring her doctor's advice and barely eating. </p><p> Gabrielle was heartsick herself, having to watch her mother's decline. She might not have approved of her mother's obsession with Albert, or her unwillingness to try harder to save her marriage, but she still loved her mother deeply and had done everything she could think of to cheer her up. She'd filled her mother's room with flowers that she scoured the neighborhood for, read to her mother aloud, even insisted their housekeeper, Margery, spend a good portion of her day visiting with her, since she was such a chatty woman and usually quite funny in her remarks. Margery had been with them several years at that point. Middle-aged with bright red hair, vivid blue eyes, and a host of freckles, she was opinionated, outspoken, and not at all awed by aristocrats. She was also a very caring woman, and had taken to the Brookses as if they were her own family. </p><p> Gabrielle had thought her efforts were working, that her mother's will to live was returning. Her mother had even started to eat again and stopped mentioning Albert. So Gabrielle was devastated when her mother passed away in the middle of the night. "Pined away" was Gabrielle's personal conclusion, because she'd been on the mend from her illness, though she would never mention that to her father. But her mother's death left Gabrielle feeling utterly alone. </p><p> Although she'd been left a lot of money, since Carla had been quite well-to-do herself from a family inheritance, Gabrielle wouldn't see any of that money until she reached her majority at the age of twenty-one, and that was a long way off. Her father did send funds regularly, and there was the household money that would last quite a while, but she'd just turned eighteen. </p><p> She was also going to be turned over to a guardian. Carla's solicitor, William Bates, had mentioned it at the reading of the will. In her grief, she hadn't really paid attention, but when she'd been given the name, she was appalled. The man was a philanderer and everyone knew it. The rumors were that he chased his maids all over his house, and he'd even pinched Gabrielle's bottom once at a garden party, when she'd been only fifteen! </p><p> A guardian, and he in particular, wouldn't do a'tall. She still had one parent living. She merely needed to find him, and so she set out to do just that. She'd had to conquer a few fears first, of sailing halfway around the world, of leaving behind everything <i>she</i> was familiar with. She'd nearly changed her mind twice. But in the end, she'd felt she had no choice. And at least Margery had agreed to go with her. </p><p> The trip had gone very well, much better than she'd anticipated. No one had questioned her traveling with just her servant. She was under the captain's protection, after all, at least for the duration, and she had implied her father would be meeting her when they docked, just a small lie to keep any concerns at bay. </p><p> Now, thinking about her father and finding him kept her current fears in check for only a short while. Her legs had fallen asleep, curled into the barrel as she was. She'd had no trouble getting all of herself into the container. She wasn't a big woman at only five-four, and was slender of frame. A splinter had pierced her back, though, when she'd scrunched down into the crate just before she'd pulled the lid back over it, and there was no way to reach it even if she had enough room to try. </p><p> And she was partly in shock that it was even possible for a ship to fly a Jolly Roger in this day and age. Pirates were supposed to be extinct. She had thought they had all been routed in the last century, either pardoned or hung. Sailing the warm Caribbean waters was supposed to be as safe as walking down an English country lane. If she hadn't been certain of that, she never would have booked passage to this side of the world. And yet, she'd seen the pirate flag with her own eyes. </p><p> There was a tight knot of fear in her belly, which was also empty and adding to her discomfort. She'd missed breakfast and had intended to remedy that at lunch, but the pirate ship had arrived before lunch was served, and now it was hours later. At least, it seemed like she'd been cramped in the barrel that long, and there was no indication of what was going on topside. </p><p> She had to assume they were staying far ahead of the pirate ship, but if they had lost the other vessel, wouldn't Avery have come to tell her so? Suddenly a blast shook the entire ship, and another, and more, all exceedingly loud. There were more indications that a battle had begun, the smell of gun smoke from the fired cannons that seeped into the hold, the raucous yells, even a few screams, and then, a long while later, the horrible silence. </p><p> It was impossible to determine who had won the battle. It was nerve-wracking. As time passed, her fear grew. She'd be screaming soon, she was sure. In fact, she didn't know how she'd managed not to succumb to that urge already. If they had won the day, wouldn't Avery have shown up by now? Unless he was wounded and hadn't told anyone where she was. Unless he was dead. Did she dare leave her hiding place to find out? </p><p> But what if the pirates had won? What did pirates do with captured ships? Sink them? Keep them to sell or man them with their own crews? And their current crew and passengers? Kill them all? The scream was bubbling up in her throat when the lid was torn off of her barrel. </p><p> Copyright � 2006 by Johanna Lindsey </p><p></p><p> <b>Chapter 8</b> </p><p> </p><p> Gabrielle's nerves were nearly shredded by the time they knocked on the door in Berkeley Square.

Pessimism and distress are overwhelming people the world over. In this maelstrom of emotion, solastalgia, the homesickness you have when you are still at home, has become, writes Glenn A. Albrecht, one of the defining emotions of the twenty-first century.</p><p><i>Earth Emotions</i> examines our positive and negative Earth emotions. It explains the author's concept of solastalgia and other well-known eco-emotions such as biophilia and topophilia. Albrecht introduces us to the many new words needed to describe the full range of our emotional responses to the emergent state of the world. We need this creation of a hopeful vocabulary of positive emotions, argues Albrecht, so that we can extract ourselves out of environmental desolation and reignite our millennia-old biophilia&#x2015;love of life&#x2015;for our home planet. To do so, he proposes a dramatic change from the current human-dominated Anthropocene era to one that will be founded, materially, ethically, politically, and spiritually on the revolution in thinking being delivered by contemporary symbiotic science. Albrecht names this period the Symbiocene.</p><p>With the current and coming generations, "Generation Symbiocene," Albrecht sees reason for optimism. The battle between the forces of destruction and the forces of creation will be won by Generation Symbiocene, and <i>Earth Emotions</i> presents an ethical and emotional odyssey for that victory.</p></p><p><p>Glenn A. Albrecht is an Australian environmental philosopher. He established the now widely used and accepted concept of solastalgia, or the lived experience of negative environmental change. He retired from Murdoch University&nbsp;in 2014 as a Professor of Sustainability,&nbsp;and&nbsp;he is now an Honorary Associate in the School of Geosciences at the University of Sydney.</p><p>"In <i>Earth Emotions</i>, Albrecht seeks to provide a new lexicon of emotional terms.

Thompson, and Philip K. Dick, <i>Chameleo</i> is a true account of what happened in a seedy Southern California town when an enthusiastic and unrepentant heroin addict named Dion Fuller sheltered a U.S. Marine who'd stolen night vision goggles and perhaps a few top secret files from a nearby military base. <p>Dion found himself arrested (under the ostensible auspices of The Patriot Act) for conspiring with international terrorists to smuggle Top Secret military equipment out of Camp Pendleton. The fact that Dion had absolutely nothing to do with international terrorists, smuggling, Top Secret military equipment, or Camp Pendleton didn't seem to bother the military. He was released from jail after a six-day-long Abu-Ghraib-style interrogation. Subsequently, he believed himself under intense government scrutiny -- and, he suspected, the subject of bizarre experimentation involving ''cloaking''-- electro-optical camouflage so extreme it renders observers practically invisible from a distance of some meters -- by the Department of Homeland Security. Hallucination? Perhaps -- except Robert Guffey, an English teacher and Dion's friend, tracked down and interviewed one of the scientists behind the project codenamed ''Chameleo,'' experimental technology which appears to have been stolen by the U.S. Department of Defense and deployed on American soil. More shocking still, Guffey discovered that the DoD has been experimenting with its newest technologies on a number of American citizens. </p><p>A condensed version of this story was the cover feature of <i>Fortean Times Magazine</i> (September 2013).</p></p><p><b>Robert Guffey</b> is a lecturer in the Department of English at California State University - Long Beach.

He lives in Illinois.PreS-Gr 2&#x2013;A young boy describes an annual Fourth of July celebration he enjoys with his family and neighbors at a nearby park. After the pajama-clad youngster briefly joins a parade passing his house, he sets about doing the chores he's in charge of, like putting finishing touches on picnic fare and loading the food into a wagon as his dog looks on. Then the family is off, first to the station to greet the flag-festooned train and then to the park. There they enjoy chocolate-covered strawberries, cherry pie, and other goodies along with hot dogs fresh off the grill. The fun-filled day includes face painting, races, interaction with zoo animals, a concert, talent show, and dancing, and culminates in spectacular fireworks over the ball field. Created with pencil, pen, and ink with watercolor and gouache, the large illustrations depict a friendly, multi-ethnic community. Flags abound, not only on the train, but also in people's hands, on houses, and on the grandstand. Three brilliantly colored double spreads show fireworks so wonderful the boy's "heart is cheering" as he "scream[s] with joy." Finally, the red wagon bearing the sleeping child and his dog appears across another spread followed by a scene in which the two are snuggled together in bed. VERDICT Though the steam-powered train at the station evokes a bygone era, this is an excellent read-aloud choice for current Fourth of July revelers and for all holiday collections.&#x2013;Marianne Saccardi, Children's Literature Consultant, Cambridge, MA</p><h2>The Letters of 2 Peter and Jude (The Pillar New Testament Commentary (PNTC))</h2><p>Filling a notable gap in scholarship on 2 Peter and Jude, Peter Davids artfully unpacks these two neglected but fascinating epistles that deal with the confrontation between the Greco-Roman world and the burgeoning first-century Jesus communities.

In telling the story of her own initiation and painstaking education in voodoo, Beaubrun takes us into the mystical dimensions of this ancient religion."&#x2014;<em>The Guardian UK</em></p><p>Like all the great religions, Vodou has an external, public practice of rituals and ceremonies&#x2014;and also an internal, mystical dimension. Before <em>Nan D�mi</em>, works about Vodou have concentrated on the spectacular outward manifestations of Vodou observance&#x2014;hypnotic drumming and chanting, frenetic dancing, fits of spirit possession. But practically all reports on Vodou are outsider accounts, which means that they are stopped at the threshold.</p><p>Mimerose Beaubrun, educated as an anthropologist, set out to write another such work, but in the process she met the woman who would become her ultimate teacher and guide to the religion's internal mysteries: Tante Tansia, whose knowledge, wisdom and spiritual power govern the text of <em>Nan D�mi.</em></p><p><em>Nan D�mi</em> is the only account of Vodou's private, mystical, interior practice that has been offered to the public so far. Its content stands in the same relation to ceremonial Vodou as Zen to conventional Buddhism, Sufism to conventional Islam, the practice of the desert saints to conventional Christianity. Mimerose Beaubrun has been a student of Vodou for half of her life, but she is also adept, and in this uniquely valuable work, she divests herself of all scholarly apparatus to speak from Vodou's purest heart.</p><p>This English edition includes a fascinating introduction by Madison Smartt Bell, placing the religion and Beaubrun's memoir in historical context.</p><p><strong>Praise for <em>Nan D�mi:</em></strong></p><p>"Mimerose Beaubrun's book <em>Nan D�mi: An Initiate's Journey into Haitian Vodou</em>&#x2014;the first part of the title refers to a spiritual state&#x2014;is a welcome addition to the canon of vodou scholarship, a deeply felt inside account of a faith of often daunting complexity."&#x2014;<em>The Miami Herald</em></p><p>"<em>Nan D�mi</em> is a fascinating look inside the Haitian Vodou religion. Mimerose Beaubrun provides a valuable contribution taking us along into the world of Nan D�mi, a dream state and stage in the initiate's journey to mastery . . . In the process the reader is introduced into a world that is far more than a religious tradition. Haitian Vodou is also a way of speaking about Haiti, as Beaubrun explains, 'its language, culture, even its way of walking, of preparing food, of dressing, of making love, of communicating with unknown worlds.' The book casts its spell on the reader who persists in the journey under the tutelage of Beaubrun and her teachers. Madison Smartt Bell's excellent introduction places the religion and Beaubrun's memoir in historical context."&#x2014;Julia Alvarez</p><p>"Vodou is one of the most valuable&#x2014;and misunderstood&#x2014;of all New World cultural creations. Mimerose Beaubrun's remarkable work opens up for the first time the internal world of Vodou, and what emerges is a singular engagement with a system of belief that cannot fail to impress any reader with its sheer sophistication and complexity. Gradually, the author recounts the ways in which she came to know the timeless wisdom of Vodou. Absolutely essential reading for anyone interested in Haiti, or in religion and society more broadly."&#x2014;Martin Munro, author and editor of <em>Haiti Rising: Haitian History, Culture and the Earthquake of 2010</em></p></p><p><p>Mimerose Beaubron was born in Ouanaminthe, in northwest Haiti. A social and cultural anthropologist, she is also the co-founder and principal singer of the world music band, Boukmans Ekperyans. In 2002 she, along with the group, was nominated as a Peace and Goodwill ambassador by the United Nations.</p><p>Madison Smartt Bell is an American writer, known for his trilogy of novels about Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian Revolution, published 1995-2004. Finalist for the National Book Award and recipient of a PEN/Faulkner award, Bell was raised in Nashville and lived in New York and London before settling in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>"So Haiti, known for its natural and sociopolitical calamities, offers us a book about the immaterial, trans-rational spirituality of its Vodou, about the world beyond time and space. Most works about Vodou until now were, according to Madison Smartt Bell&#x2019;s superlative preface, about its 'external' elements. Thus, Beaubrun&#x2019;s personalized account of her spiritual itinerary is even more valuable . . . Such observations illustrate the fascination of this book, which enlightens us about Haitian spirituality and provides invaluable insights into Haitian culture.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert H. McCormick, Jr., <em>World Literature Today</em></p><p>"For those looking for a first-person guide&amp;mash;and importantly, a Haitian guide&#x2014;into the ways of Vodou, Mimerose Beaubrun's <em>Nan D�mi </em>is a unique, indispensable, and mysterious primer."&#x2014;Amy Wilentz, author of <em>The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier</em> and <em>Farewell, Fred Voodoo: A Letter From Haiti</em></p><p>"<em>Nan Domi</em> stays localized in Haiti, yet its universality, like that of Buddhism or Hinduism or any of the enduring religious worldviews, becomes apparent from Beaubrun&#x2019;s instructive guidance into this transferable territory. She directly confronts the same questions that arise in every worldview, every philosophy, every religion, and every science . . . Beaubrun takes us along the Vodou path to comprehending the nature of the universe, the nature of the ordinary and the divine, and also into the mired terrain of darkness and light, evil and suffering, and human frailty and strength, the twin threats of being and nothingness . . . Her story courageously unfolds her personal extension and deepening of awareness, not as a substitute for ordinary Western ways but as expansion of comprehension and competency . . . These are the lessons of this important book.&#x201d;&#x2014;LeGrace Benson, Associate Editor, <em>Journal of Haitian Studies</em></p><p>"Reading Mimerose Beaubrun's <em>Nan D�mi: An Initiate&#x2019;s Journey into Haitian Vodou</em> is like crossing the threshold into a dream-state of boundless mysteries. Beaubrun&#x2019;s training as an anthropologist is evident in this captivating book. Each page is replete with the intricate details which only a seasoned researcher can provide. What begins as an expedition to uncover the inner workings of a Lakou/community leads to acquiring the esoteric knowledge which only an initiate may gain."&#x2014;Katia D. Ulysse, author of <em>Drifting</em></p><p>"What makes <em>Nan D�mi</em> a standout from other texts on Haitian Vodou is Beaubrun&#x2019;s willingness to share her personal accounts of Vodou, and to resist the urge to justify Vodou&#x2019;s mysticism to a Western audience ... <em>Nan D�mi</em> is not a Vodou apologist text. It neither deliberately recoups Vodou from an avalanche of negative portrayals and stereotypes, nor does it provide a base understanding of Vodou philosophy through a systematic and linear articulation of major themes and concepts in Haitian Vodou in a way that might be more digestible for Western readers. Instead, <em>Nan D�mi</em>, posits Vodou&#x2019;s universality ... perhaps those with the most to gain from reading Nan Domi, are fellow scholars and academics of Haiti/Haitian Vodou who, similarly to Beaubrun believe they have a sufficient understanding of the theoretical concepts and workings of Vodou."&#x2014;<em>Haiti: Then and Now</em></p><p>"Mimerose Beaubrun&#x2019;s <em>Nan D�mi</em> opens the barriers between this world and Ginen anba dlo ('Africa beneath the waters'). What distinguishes Beaubrun&#x2019;s text from the many anthropological studies of Vodou previously published is that it eschews the public ritual aspects of the religion, to focus entirely on its private, inner, mystical elements as experienced by an initiated vodouist. Beaubrun allows her readers to accompany her on her path, with all its trials, terrors, dead-ends, frustrations, and revelations from the kalfou (crossroads) of this world, to the realm of Nan D�mi (a state of lucid dreaming) and the mystic heart of Vodou, where in the state of possession ego is abandoned and the initiate incarnates as a divine spirit.&#x201d;&#x2014;Simon Lee, <em>The Caribbean Review of Books</em></p></p><h2>Jump, Frog, Jump!</h2><p><p>"This is the turtle that slid into the pond and ate the snake that dropped from a branch and swallowed the fish that swam after the frog -- JUMP, FROG, JUMP!"

Barry and Honey Sherman appeared to lead charmed lives. But the world was shocked in late 2017 when their bodies were found in a bizarre tableau in their elegant Toronto home. First described as murder-suicide&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;belts looped around their necks, they were found seated beside their basement swimming pool&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;police later ruled it a staged, targeted double murder. Nothing about the case made sense to friends of the founder of one of the world&#x2019;s largest generic pharmaceutical firms and his wife, a powerhouse in Canada&#x2019;s charity world. Together, their wealth has been estimated at well over $4.7 billion.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was another side to the story. A strategic genius who built a large generic drug company &#x2014;&nbsp;Apotex Inc. &#x2014;&nbsp;Barry Sherman was a self-described workaholic, renowned risk-taker, and disruptor during his fifty-year career. Regarded as a generous friend by many, Sherman was also feared by others. He was criticized for stifling academic freedom and using the courts to win at all costs. Upset with building issues at his mansion, he sued and recouped millions from tradespeople. At the time of his death, Sherman had just won a decades-old legal case involving four cousins who wanted 20 percent of his fortune.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Toronto Star</i> investigative journalist Kevin Donovan chronicles the unsettling story from the beginning, interviewing family members, friends, and colleagues, and sheds new light on the Shermans&#x2019; lives and the disturbing double murder.

Beside his father&#x2019;s grave, a diligent but doubting son begins the mourner&#x2019;s kaddish and realizes he needs to know more about the prayer issuing from his lips. So begins Leon Wieseltier&#x2019;s National Jewish Book Award&#x2013;winning autobiography,&nbsp;<i>Kaddish</i>, the spiritual journal of a man commanded by Jewish law to recite a prayer three times daily for a year and driven, by ardor of inquiry, to explore its origins. Here is one man&#x2019;s urgent exploration of Jewish liturgy and law, from the 10th-century legend of a wayward ghost to the speculations of medieval scholars on the grief of God to the perplexities of a modern rabbi in the Kovno ghetto. Here too is a mourner&#x2019;s unmannered response to the questions of fate, freedom, and faith stirred in death&#x2019;s wake. Lyric, learned, and deeply moving, Wieseltier&#x2019;s <i>Kaddish</i> is a narrative suffused with love: a son&#x2019;s embracing the tradition bequeathed to him by his father, a scholar&#x2019;s savoring they beauty he was taught to uncover, and a writer&#x2019;s revealing it, proudly, unadorned, to the reader.<br><br>Winner of the 1998 National Jewish Book Award<br><br>"An astonishing fusion of learning and psychic intensity; its poignance and lucidity should be an authentic benefit to readers, Jewish and gentile." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Leon Wieseltier's <i>Kaddish</i> is a completely new kind of book. It is not quite philosophy, autobiography, history, or Midrash, but it blends all of these genres into a narrative of Wieseltier's grief during the year following his father's death. Wieseltier, the literary editor of <i>The New Republic,</i> is a mostly unobservant Jew whose grief compelled him to observe his religion's rituals of mourning, daily attending synagogue to recite the Kaddish (the traditional Jewish prayers of mourning). He also delved deeply into a vast range of texts describing the history and spiritual significance of these prayers. And he wrote incessantly, describing with force and clarity the process of bringing his mind and heart to bear on the grief that consumed him. Perhaps the best way of describing this moving, illuminating, hopeful, awe-filled book is to quote a stray line from the first page of the book's first chapter: "Out of tears, thoughts." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Read this extraordinary book and you will be both intellectually enriched and deeply moved. <br>You will find in it Leon Wieseltier's passion for learning and remarkable style. His ex-ploration of the Jewish laws of mourning, so thoughtful, so necessary, is the best I have ever read. His Kaddish is not only for his father; it is for all fathers for whom no kaddish has been said"<br>--Elie Wiesel<p>"This strange, enchanting, powerful, sometimes frustrating but always compelling masterpiece<br>works through the great themes of life and death intertwined with a complex fugue played out in three parts: Wieseltier's own encounter, as the year of mourning unfolded, with the inner life of the faith, the narrative of his family's sorrow, but, above all, how the sages and saints of Judaism through the ages reflected, in detail, about death and mourning. The result is a profound work not about Judaism but of Judaism: The inner life of the faith mediated through the sensibility of a wise, deeply learned, and reliable guide. I cannot point to another piece of writing in the English language that accomplishes within--and for--Judaism what Wieseltier has achieved."<br> --Jacob Neusner, <i>National Review</i></p><p>"Wieseltier's Kaddish is an astonishing fusion of learning and psychic intensity;Its poignance and lucidity should be an authentic benefit to readers, Jewish and gentile, who seek access to rabbinical tradition...I am certain I will read this book again"<br> --Harold Bloom, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Groundbreaking in American letters...This is a narrative suffused with love: a man's love for the tradition bequeathed him by his father and shared with his mother and sister, a man's savoring of the beauty he was taught to uncover and his revealing it, proudly unadorned, to us" <br> --Nessa Rapoport, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p>"I have never read a book like this. No one has.It is something new in the world, and at the same time something very old.

It seems hardly enough to say that Leon Wieseltier's Kaddish is beautiful, wise, amazing"<br>--Cynthia Ozick</p><p>"A brilliant book...Wieseltier has an aphoristic intelligence, and in a sense he is taking his place in a line of philosophers which runs from Pascal to Nietzsche and on to E.

An independent, bipartisan panel led by nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis, the commission was charged with finding and reporting the relevant facts, investigating how the nuclear war began, and determining whether our government was adequately prepared for combating a nuclear adversary and safeguarding U.S. citizens. Did President Trump and his advisers understand North Korean views about nuclear weapons? Did they appreciate the dangers of provoking the country&#x2019;s ruler with social media posts and military exercises? Did the tragic milestones of that fateful month&#x2014;North Korea's accidental shoot-down of Air Busan flight 411, the retaliatory strike by South Korea, and the tweet that triggered vastly more carnage&#x2014;inevitably lead to war? Or did America&#x2019;s leaders have the opportunity to avert the greatest calamity in the history of our nation?<br><br> Answering these questions will not bring back the lives lost in March 2020.

Isn&#x2019;t taking a relaxing stroll preferable to pounding out early morning miles on the treadmill? The French live this way, yet stay thin and healthy. Now, with <i>The French Don&#x2019;t Diet Plan</i>, you can, too! <br><br> In his groundbreaking book, <i>The Fat Fallacy</i>, Dr. Will Clower was the first to present a theory of how the French maintain low obesity and heart disease rates despite their seemingly &#x201c;unhealthy&#x201d; lifestyle. Dr. Clower learned that the French don&#x2019;t worry about dieting but rather are more concerned with how they eat. That means paying attention to the taste, pacing, and enjoyment of meals, instead of counting calories, cutting fat and carbs, or taking guilt trips to the gym. <br><br>Now, in <i>The French Don&#x2019;t Diet Plan</i>, Dr. Clower shows how easy it is to incorporate his remarkably effective techniques and the French lifestyle into a busy American day.<br><br> Dr. Clower has found that natural foods have overwhelmingly been pushed out of the American diet by what he calls &#x201c;faux foods&#x201d;: processed, additive-filled convenience products, often marketed as healthy with buzzwords like low fat and low carb. In addition, mealtimes should be a slow, sensual break for the body and mind&#x2014;not a face-stuffing frenzy while standing up in the kitchen or sitting behind the wheel. As a result of such habits, Dr. Clower says, we are not eating what our bodies need, and we&#x2019;re eating in a way that is not conducive to proper digestion. Science shows this precise combination of factors causes weight gain.<br><br> The French approach is about taking the time to enjoy real food without guilt or deprivation.

Dr. Clower lives in Pittsburgh.PART ONE <br><br>What the French Eat <br><br>On the Sa�ne River in Lyon, France, a lively farmers' market sprawls along much of the left bank on most mornings of the week. The <br>rst time I came across it, I was astonished at the possibilities beyond our conventional American supermarkets. In this single stretch, vendors sell <br>fty varieties of mushrooms and more than twenty kinds of olives. The market offered dozens of just-baked breads, hundreds of fragrant cheeses, fresh poultry and game, along with countless herbs, greens, nuts, and legumes. Needless to say, there was not a box of macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles in sight, so I ended up buying fresh green beans, some baby red potatoes, and sliced pork for dinner. <br><br>Once I embraced fresh food as normal, I came to realize perhaps the biggest difference between the French diet and our own: They eat real foods, we eat food products. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that the steady yearly increases in processed food product consumption reached $461 billion by 1993 and is still increasing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that the demand for these products is on the rise globally as well. <br><br>The problem? Almost all packaged products are laced with an Acme junior chemistry set of preservatives, dyes, thickeners, stabilizers, sweeteners, and acidulants, among other things. The ingredient lists for even the simplest foods, like Healthy Choice ice cream or Wonder Bread, neither of which should have more than <br>ve ingredients, consists of rows of unpronounceable microprint. I call these faux foods-and they're directly responsible for sabotaging our weight-loss efforts. <br><br>Yes, faux foods are cheaper, because food companies can stamp them out with a shelf life approaching that of plastic. Yes, they're attractive, because these same industries spend $33 billion per year to enroll your favorite basketball star and pop singer to endorse them. Yes, they're tasty, because the chemical sweeteners are synthesized to make it 150 times sweeter than sugar. But despite the advertising claims of added vitamins and minerals, nothing makes those products healthy, and they certainly aren't real foods. <br><br>Nevertheless, we eat them. Instead of eggs (cholesterol!) we eat egg substitute. Instead of butter (fat!) we eat margarine. Instead of bread (carbs!) we eat sorbitol-sweetened oxymoronic low-carb pasta. Instead of normal fruits and vegetables for nutrition, we chase junk food with supplement pills. Instead of natural oils (more fat!) our foods have gone through a chemical hydrogenation process. <br><br>In this section, I'll show you how a simple return to delicious, ordinary food is the solution for permanent weight loss. The French, not surprisingly, don't suffer our dreadful problems with weight and health-but they don't deprive themselves either. In fact, they're known for the most famously sumptuous diet on the planet and have three times less obesity, three times fewer heart attacks, and they live longer than us-men and women. Think about this: If they can get those results, so can you. <br><br>I hear what you're saying already. "I'm not a gourmet French chef. I don't have an outdoor market of wonderful fresh healthy foods in my front yard (and no Sa�ne River either)!" Or maybe you're not sure how you'd ever go without the prepackaged stuff you're used to buying. But I promise that it's easier than you ever imagined it could be to transition from faux foods to real foods, even by shopping in your own local grocery store. Yes, there are a lot of products you'll have to pass up-but this doesn't mean you'll be depriving yourself of any favorite meals (including dessert) or the avors you love. To help you make the transition, we'll walk through every aisle together and show you how simple the switch really is. <br><br>But <br>rst, and this is the toughest part, you must overcome any thoughts that hold you back. After all, embracing high-calorie foods strikes our diet-centric thinking as just wrong. This is often the <br>rst step at my PATH curriculum for healthy weight loss. People invariably ask, "Did you say give up low-fat and fat-free products? Stop counting calories? Forget low-carb diets? Can I really control my weight and still eat delicious foods?" <br><br>They're all asking different versions of the same question: "Don't I have to suffer through a hell of deprivation before I'm redeemed with heavenly thin thighs?" <br><br>The answer, of course, is no! <br><br>Part One takes you on the <br>rst three steps toward perhaps the most important part of a lifestyle of better health and smaller pants, the simple difference between what and what not to eat. Don't eat faux-food chemicals. They must be replaced with real foods. <br><br>Just as any meaningful change starts at home, Step 1 takes you on an all-out pantry purge. In the process of cleaning out the kitchen, you'll learn the faux-food ingredients that harm your heart and pack on pounds. <br><br>Once the fake foods are gone, we're going shopping together in Step 2. We'll stroll the supermarket, aisle by aisle, to <br>nd the good amid the bad and the chemically modi<br>ed ugly. <br><br>Because much of the packaged food we're used to is packed with high-fructose corn syrup, an intense sweetener, Step 3 shows how your switch to real foods literally changes what kind of food your body asks for and curbs your sweet tooth for good. Just as your body's need for high food volume will drop over time, your craving for over-sugared foods will evaporate as well. You'll recognize, by taste, just how much sugar <br>lls all kinds of faux foods, and they won't even taste good to you anymore. <br><br>In the end, your taste buds will return to normal-and so will your weight. You'll slim down, feel better, and have more energy through the day, effortlessly. And all this starts simply by getting to know real foods again. <br><br>Step 1 <br><br>Forget Faux Foods <br><br>A few weeks before I was scheduled to leave for France, my wife, Dottie, and I attended a neuroscience convention in Washington, D.C. One night, our new French boss-to-be was taking us to dinner to introduce us to his Lyon research team. All dressed up and ready for a lovely meal, we met them on the sidewalk, piled into a cab, and headed over to the restaurant. <br><br>As soon as we got in the car, Dottie and I both were immediately distracted by Judith, the team's neuroanatomist. This young French-Portuguese woman was a svelte, awless, Sophia Loren-type beauty. She spoke with ease and elegance, clearly aware of every nuance of her manner and movements. It was obvious that she was a woman who really took care of herself. <br><br>As soon as we reached the restaurant, I became curious to see what such a careful French beauty would eat. I made mental guesses-a sparse green salad with a dot of low-fat dressing, perhaps? A plain chicken breast, hold the potatoes? <br><br>I could see her struggling to <br>nd something on the menu and understood why only after we got to France, because normally she would order choices like foie gras, a rich duck breast with veggies, followed by a little dessert (a tart or cr�me br�l�e) and some cheese. <br><br>At one point, as we chatted and waited for our meals, Judith slowly leaned over the middle of the table to scrutinize the little round packets of nondairy creamer. <br><br>"What ees zat?" she asked me, pointedly, as if I were responsible. <br><br>"Ah," I responded. Easy question. "That's nondairy creamer." <br><br>She frowned. "Yes, but what ees zat?" she said, a bit more emphatically this time. She held one tiny container of the liquid up to the light, clearly disturbed. I started trying to regurgitate my organic chemistry background for a cogent answer when my new boss saved me from my stammer of obscure nomenclature. "It's arti<br>cial cream-read the ingredients," he told her. "Americans put it in their coffee." <br><br>"No," she breathed. "Een zer coffee?? Zats deesgusting!" Then she warily poked her <br>nger through the remainder of the plastic packets in the bowl, as though she might be bitten by some new lurking threat. <br><br>Seizing the moment, I informed her that arti<br>cial foods were quite normal here. Hadn't she ever heard of Sweet'n Low? Sugar-free Jell-O? After her near-death experience with the nondairy dairy product, we had her going with outrageous shock and dismay. She'd just never seen the fake foods that I-like all of us-had come to accept as perfectly normal. <br><br>Of course, at the time, I thought she was the crazy one. Only a few months later, the tables were turned and my family and I were the ones in culture shock. This time, it was the very lack of arti<br>cial foods and quickie prepackaged products around us that was so strange. In fact, we found ourselves forced to buy full-calorie, full-avor "real" foods simply because there was nothing else to choose from. Our meals always tasted wonderful, but I was sure we'd return from our two years abroad each at least twenty pounds heavier. It just didn't happen. Just a few months into our trip, it became clear that we were breaking every dietary rule in the book and losing weight anyway! <br><br>If there are secrets to the French love affair with the meal, or unspoken advice about what's keeping them thin and healthy, the <br>rst is their insistence on high-quality natural foods that come from the earth, not a chemical plant. This is so simple, so intuitively correct. <br><br>How to Recognize a Faux Food <br><br>Avoiding faux foods doesn't sound too hard, until you sift through the parade of products lining our store shelves. How do you know what's healthy and what's not? Take bread, for example. The French eat baguettes every day. But does that make plastic-wrapped spongy "white bread" that lasts for two weeks okay to eat? No! And that begs the question again, how do you know the difference between real bread and fake bread, between real food and faux food? <br><br>To sort this out, let's do a thought experiment. Say I took a photograph of a fresh baguette. Our modern technology allows you to see an image that looks exactly like bread. If someone asked you what it was, you could certainly identify it. But would you eat the picture? Of course not. You can see it's not food; it's a photograph. <br><br>What if I made a three-dimensional replica from a plastic polymer and painted it so well that it looked exactly like an authentic baguette? Our modern technology can make it look so real that you wouldn't even be able to tell it was fake until you put your hands on it. Would you eat that bread? Would you cut it into pieces, put it in your mouth, and swallow it? Of course not, because you can tell by touch that it's not food. It's a synthetic model. <br><br>What if, instead, food chemists made a bread model that simulated the texture of real bread? Our modern technology can replace the harder plastics with synthetic, partially hydrogenated oils. <br><br>What if they spritzed the model with odorants so it actually made your mouth water with the homey aroma of freshly baked bread straight from the oven? Our modern technology can produce edible chemicals that easily conjure the smell and taste of wonderful breads. <br><br>So the bread now looks like it's not fake, smells like it's not fake, tastes like it's not fake, and even feels like it's not fake. Are you going to eat this bread? Let me tell you, people eat synthetic products designed to appear as though they're not fake every single day! <br><br>Some popular diets will tell you it's okay to eat bread, others say to avoid it like the plague. But when it comes to our health, the problem is not with the carbohydrates-it's whether the bread we're eating is actually food or if its nutritional value has been replaced with arti<br>cial substitutes. <br><br>At one PATH curriculum seminar here in Pennsylvania, a man from the audience spoke to me about his father, who had worked as a food chemist for Heinz many years. He said his dad would come home with little bottles and have his kids try his concoctions. He remembered one bottle of gray gloop in particular. He was told to close his eyes and try it from a teaspoon. <br><br>"Ketchup," dismissed the boy. "That's just ketchup." <br><br>"Aha!" the father beamed. "But there's not one single tomato in there!" <br><br>His father had managed to simulate the taste and feel of tomato ketchup in a chemistry lab. A terri<br>c accomplishment of science, no doubt, but is it food? Of course not. <br><br>This is the most stunning, mind-bending fact of our modern technological world. We are allowed, coached, and even encouraged to eat things that are not food. Given this tendency, here are some starter rules to remember. <br><br>Check the ingredients-they must be natural. And the best foods are ones that don't require labels for you to know what they are! <br><br>How to Read Labels <br><br>The European Union has tried a couple of times to introduce FDA-style labels with our standard nutritional calculus of the food listed on the back. But they can't get it done because there's just no market for it. No one wants or needs it because they're not agonizing over the grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrates in their foods. <br><br>The French don't go to the store to buy grams of this or that. They go to buy food. <br><br>That said, here in America, you really should read the labels unless you're absolutely sure of the food source, because of the reasons we've mentioned-that so many normal-looking foods are actually fake. But when you do peruse that periodic table on the back of the box, don't sweat the amount of macromolecules (your healthy eating habits will limit your consumption of them for you!-see Part Two). Rather, look to see whether the ingredients are real; they should have grown from the earth, have had a mama and a daddy, or can be found in a standard biology text. <br><br>For example, bread made with our, salt, water, and yeast is good. That made with thirty-seven unpronounceable ingredients is not-and it makes no difference whatsoever how many carbs, fats, or proteins are in that product. Tons of lab bench chemicals are fat free, and tons more are carb free. But you shouldn't be eating any of them! <br><br>I hope you see the point. We've been coached to read labels for the wrong things. By being overly focused on the macromolecules, we've allowed ourselves to eat hydrogenated oils that are harming our hearts and high-fructose corn syrup that helps make us fat. When you read the labels for real foods, you avoid all that because there are no synthetic dyes in an apple or chemical sweeteners in a tomato. <br><br>Why Avoid Faux Food? <br><br>Never before in human history (until now) have we had to ask the question, What is food? Our biology took care of that for us, through our senses. But now, synthetics can fool our physiology into thinking something's okay to consume, when it's nothing but a cheap imitation, a faux food that undermines your weight and health.</p><h2>WARLOCK BY JIM STARLIN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION</h2><p>At '70s Marvel, no one mastered the startling scope and high-concept complexity of cosmic adventure like Jim Starlin!

During World War II, he was arrested as a member of a partisan group and deported to Auschwitz. After the camp&#x2019;s liberation, he returned to Italy and worked as a chemist, writing only on the side. His first book <i>Survival at Auschwitz</i> was a personal account of his year at the camps. The follow-up memoir <i>The Reawakening</i> cemented Levi as a leading authority on the Holocaust.

Since that time he has answered thousands of questions about birds, both at his store and while walking down the aisles of the supermarket. The questions have ranged from inquiries about individual species ("Are flamingos really real?") to what and when to feed birds ("Should I bring in my feeders for the summer?") to the down-and-dirty specifics of backyard birding ("Why are the birds dropping poop in my pool?"). Answering the questions has been easy; keeping a straight face has been hard.<br><br><i>Why Don't Woodpeckers Get Headaches?</i> is the solution for the beginning birder who already has a book that explains the slight variation between Common Ground-Doves and Ruddy Ground-Doves but who is really much more interested in why birds sing at 4:30 A.M. instead of 7:00 A.M., or whether it's okay to feed bread to birds, or how birds rediscover your feeders so quickly when you've just filled them after a long vacation. Or, for that matter, whether flamingos are really real.</p><p><b>Mike O&#x2019;Connor</b> is the owner of Bird Watcher&#x2019;s General Store on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. His column, "Ask the Bird Folks," appears in <i>the Cape Codder</i>&nbsp;newspaper&nbsp;and his writing has been included in <i>Good Birders Don&#x2019;t Wear White</i> and <i>The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2004</i>. The author of <i>Why Don&#x2019;t Woodpeckers Get Headaches?</i> and <i>Why Do Bluebirds Hate Me?</i>, he lives in Orleans, Massachusetts, where, try as he may, he cannot entice even a single bluebird to come to his yard.<i>Cape Codder </i>columnist O'Connor ("Ask the Bird Folks") illuminates his intricate, arcane area of expertise through jovial insider explanations that will enlighten as well as entertain ornithiphiles, average backyard birdwatchers and even nonbirders. O'Connor's humorous birding columns are organized into sections on ways to attract specific species, food, unusual birds, habitats, equipment and more. Among many wry but practical answers to tongue-in-cheek and sincere questions, O'Connor explains why birdseed is healthier for birds than white bread (empty calories), but plain (not sugared) doughnuts are also better than bread. He debunks the "old wives' tale" of ostriches hiding their heads in the sand&#x2014;on the open savanna they just drop their heads to the ground hoping to appear like a bush to a predator in the distance. As for the woodpecker, it has "evolved a rather tough head. Its larger brain case prevents concussions, and the muscle and bone structure at the base of the bill serves as a shock absorber. The avian equivalent in tone and expertise to NPR's <i>Car Talk</i> Magliozzi brothers, O'Connor should net a wider audience with this amusing collection.<i> (Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It has a detailed explanation on what happened to Japan, but the discoveries made are so far-reaching that a large portion of economics literature will have to be modified to accommodate another half to the macroeconomic spectrum of possibilities that conventional theorists have overlooked.</p> <p>The author developed the idea of yin and yang business cycles where the conventional world of profit maximization is the yang and the world of balance sheet recession, where companies are minimizing debt, is the yin. Once so divided, many varied theories developed in macro economics since the 1930s can be nicely categorized into a single comprehensive theory- <i>The Holy Grail of Macro Economics</i></p></p><p><p>THE <b>HOLY GRAIL</b> OF MACROECONOMICS: LESSONS FROM JAPAN'S GREAT RECESSION</p> <p>"...any analyst of the current United States situation must consider koo's argument."<br><b>&#x2015;Lawrence H. Summers,</b> <i>Director, National Economic Council</i></p> <p>"... the Japanese policymakers who (said) the U.S. was in danger of falling into a prolonged period of economic weakness were right. To understand why ... you need to read a brilliant book by Richard Koo..."<br><b>&#x2015;Martin Wolf</b> <i>Financial Times</i></p> <p>"There will probably never be a last word on the Japanese financial catastrophe of the 1990s but Richard Koo's book may be the most significant analysis ever published. Agree or disagree, any analyst of the current United States situation must consider Koo's arguments."<br><b><b>&#x2015;</b>Lawrence H. Summers</b> <i>Director, National Economic Council</i> <i>Former President, Harvard University and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury</i></p> <p>"Richard Koo does it again. By presenting a unique theory regarding the Great Depression and Japan's recession of the last 15 years, Koo offers a new understanding of current problems in the U.S. and other economies. With many pearls of analytical wisdom, <i>The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics: Lessons from Japan's Great Recession</i> is a must-read for economists, policymakers and individual investors alike."<br><b>&#x2015;</b><b>Nobuyuki ldei</b> <i>Founder &amp; CEO, Quantum Leaps Corporation</i> <i>Former Chairman &amp; CEO, Sony Corporation</i></p> <p>"Richard Koo's pioneering work on balance-sheet recession has been invaluable in understanding the difficulty faced by Japan's economy and monetary authorities during the past 15 years. In this book, he has shown that the U.S. Great Depression was also driven by the same balance sheet concerns of the private sector, indicating that this kind of recession can happen to any post-bubble economy. I sincerely hope that the lessons contained in this book are put to good use in fighting similar recessions elsewhere, including the U.S. subprime crisis."<br><b><b>&#x2015;</b>Yasushi Mieno</b> <i>Former Governor, Bank of Japan</i></p> <p>"<i>The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics</i> presents a brilliant and original framework for understanding&#x2015;and overcoming&#x2015;a post-bubble economic crisis such as the one the world faces today. By discrediting the conventional view that monetary policy is effective in combating a post-bubble recession, Richard Koo has made an invaluable contribution to economic theory and at just the right time."<br><b>&#x2015;</b><b>Richard Duncan</b> <i>Author,</i> The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures <i>Partner, Blackhorse Asset Management</i></p>How did the great Depression of the 1930s get to be so bad for so long? That question has baffled economists for decades. Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed Chairman, even called understanding the great Depression the as yet-unattained "holy Grail of Macroeconomics." Japan's Great recession of 1990-2005 finally gave us some vital clues as to how a post-bubble economy can plunge into prolonged recession while leaving conventional policy responses largely ineffective. <p>Building on the author's earlier work Balance Sheet Recession: Japan's Struggle with Uncharted Economics and its Global Implications (John Wiley, Singapore, 2003), The Holy Grail of Macroenomics: Lessons from Japan's Great Recession argues that there are actually two phases to an economy, the ordinary (or yang) phase, in which the private sector is maximizing profits, and the post-bubble (or yin) phase, in which private sector is minimizing debt, or repairing damaged balance sheets. Although conventional economics is useful in analyzing economies in the yang phase, it is less useful in explaining phenomena such as the "liquidity trap" that is typical of an economy in the yin phase. The distinction between the yin and yang phases also explains why some policies work well in some situations but not in others. Indeed, it offers the crucial foundation to macroeconomics that has been missing since the days of Keynes.</p> <p>This groundbreaking book not only explains what happened to the U.S. during the Great Depression and to Japan during the Great recession, it also offers important policy recommendations for fighting post-bubble economic downturns in any country, including the current subprime crisis in the U.S.</p></p><h2>School-Community Relations</h2><p><p>Accessible and practical,<i> School-Community Relations, Fourth Edition</i> uses real-life examples to illustrate the ways in which administrators and school leaders can effectively engage and enlist partnerships with teachers, staff, students, parents, and community members.

I could see where a reader about halfway through might find the title all too descriptive of the story itself; but it was too beautiful, and too beautifully apt, to part with, and Mr. Silverberg let me keep it. It&#x2019;s from Marvell, &#x201c;To his Coy Mistress&#x201d;&#x2014;<br> <br>Our vegetable love should grow<br> <br>Vaster than empires, and more slow. . . .<br> <br>Like &#x201c;Nine Lives,&#x201d; this is not a psychomyth but a regular science fiction story, developed not for action/adventure, but psychologically. Unless physical action reflects psychic action, unless the deeds express the person, I get very bored with adventure stories; often it seems that the more action there is, the less happens. Obviously my interest is in what goes on inside. Inner space and all that. We all have forests in our minds. Forests unexplored, unending. Each of us gets lost in the forest, every night, alone.<br> <br>Hidden in the foliage here is a tiny act of homage. The protagonist of &#x201c;He Who Shapes&#x201d; by Roger Zelazny, one of the finest science fiction stories I know, is called Charles Render. I christened a syndrome after him.<br> <br>IT WAS ONLY DURING THE earliest decades of the League that the Earth sent ships out on the enormously long voyages, beyond the pale, over the stars and far away. They were seeking for worlds which had not been seeded or settled by the Founders on Hain, truly alien worlds. All the Known Worlds went back to the Hainish Origin, and the Terrans, having been not only founded but salvaged by the Hainish, resented this. They wanted to get away from the family. They wanted to find somebody new. The Hainish, like tiresomely understanding parents, supported their explorations, and contributed ships and volunteers, as did several other worlds of the League.<br> <br>All these volunteers to the Extreme Survey crews shared one peculiarity: they were of unsound mind.<br> <br>What sane person, after all, would go out to collect information that would not be received for five or ten centuries? Cosmic mass interference had not yet been eliminated from the operation of the ansible, and so instantaneous communication was reliable only within a range of 120 lightyears. The explorers would be quite isolated. And of course they had no idea what they might come back to, if they came back. No normal human being who had experienced time-slippage of even a few decades between League worlds would volunteer for a round trip of centuries. The Surveyors were escapists, misfits. They were nuts.<br> <br>Ten of them climbed aboard the ferry at Smeming Port, and made varyingly inept attempts to get to know one another during the three days the ferry took getting to their ship, Gum. Gum is a Cetian nickname, on the order of Baby or Pet. There were two Cetians on the team, two Hainishmen, one Beldene, and five Terrans; the Cetian-built ship was chartered by the Government of Earth. Her motley crew came aboard wriggling through the coupling tube one by one like apprehensive spermatozoa trying to fertilize the universe. The ferry left, and the navigator put Gum underway. She flittered for some hours on the edge of space a few hundred million miles from Smeming Port, and then abruptly vanished.<br> <br>When, after 10 hours 29 minutes, or 256 years, Gum reappeared in normal space, she was supposed to be in the vicinity of Star KG-E-96651. Sure enough, there was the gold pinhead of the star. Somewhere within a four-hundred-million-kilometer sphere there was also a greenish planet, World 4470, as charted by a Cetian mapmaker. The ship now had to find the planet. This was not quite so easy as it might sound, given a four-hundred-million-kilometer haystack. And Gum couldn&#x2019;t bat about in planetary space at near lightspeed; if she did, she and Star KG-E-96651 and World 4470 might all end up going bang. She had to creep, using rocket propulsion, at a few hundred thousand miles an hour. The Mathematician/Navigator, Asnanifoil, knew pretty well where the planet ought to be, and thought they might raise it within ten E-days. Meanwhile the members of the Survey team got to know one another still better.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand him,&#x201d; said Porlock, the Hard Scientist (chemistry, plus physics, astronomy, geology, etc.), and little blobs of spittle appeared on his mustache. &#x201c;The man is insane. I can&#x2019;t imagine why he was passed as fit to join a Survey team, unless this is a deliberate experiment in noncompatibility, planned by the Authority, with us as guinea pigs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We generally use hamsters and Hainish gholes,&#x201d; said Mannon, the Soft Scientist (psychology, plus psychiatry, anthropology, ecology, etc.), politely; he was one of the Hainishmen. &#x201c;Instead of guinea pigs. Well, you know, Mr. Osden is really a very rare case. In fact, he&#x2019;s the first fully cured case of Render&#x2019;s Syndrome&#x2014;a variety of infantile autism which was thought to be incurable. The great Terran analyst Hammergeld reasoned that the cause of the autistic condition in this case is a supernormal empathic capacity, and developed an appropriate treatment. Mr. Osden is the first patient to undergo that treatment, in fact he lived with Dr. Hammergeld until he was eighteen. The therapy was completely successful.<br> <br>&#x201c;Successful?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, yes. He certainly is not autistic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s intolerable!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you see,&#x201d; said Mannon, gazing mildly at the saliva-flecks on Porlock&#x2019;s mustache, &#x201c;the normal defensive-aggressive reaction between strangers meeting&#x2014;let&#x2019;s say you and Mr. Osden just for example&#x2014;is something you&#x2019;re scarcely aware of; habit, manners, inattention get you past it; you&#x2019;ve learned to ignore it, to the point where you might even deny it exists. However, Mr. Osden, being an empath, feels it. Feels his feelings, and yours, and is hard put to say which is which. Let&#x2019;s say that there&#x2019;s a normal element of hostility towards any stranger in your emotional reaction to him when you meet him, plus a spontaneous dislike of his looks, or clothes, or handshake&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t matter what. He feels that dislike. As his autistic defense has been unlearned, he resorts to an aggressive-defense mechanism, a response in kind to the aggression which you have unwittingly projected onto him.&#x201d; Mannon went on for quite a long time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing gives a man the right to be such a bastard,&#x201d; Porlock said.<br> <br>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t tune us out?&#x201d; asked Harfex, the Biologist, another Hainishman.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like hearing,&#x201d; said Olleroo, Assistant Hard Scientist, stooping over to paint her toenails with fluorescent lacquer. &#x201c;No eyelids on your ears. No Off switch on empathy. He hears our feelings whether he wants to or not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does he know what we&#x2019;re thinking?&#x201d; asked Eskwana, the Engineer, looking round at the others in real dread.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Porlock snapped. &#x201c;Empathy&#x2019;s not telepathy! Nobody&#x2019;s got telepathy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet,&#x201d; said Mannon, with his little smile. &#x201c;Just before I left Hain there was a most interesting report in from one of the recently rediscovered worlds, a hilfer named Rocannon reporting what appears to be a teachable telepathic technique existent among a mutated hominid race; I only saw a synopsis in the HILF Bulletin, but&#x2014;&#x201d; He went on. The others had learned that they could talk while Mannon went on talking; he did not seem to mind, nor even to miss much of what they said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why does he hate us?&#x201d; Eskwana said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody hates you, Ander honey,&#x201d; said Olleroo, daubing Eskwana&#x2019;s left thumbnail with fluorescent pink. The engineer flushed and smiled vaguely.<br> <br>&#x201c;He acts as if he hated us,&#x201d; said Haito, the Coordinator. She was a delicate-looking woman of pure Asian descent, with a surprising voice, husky, deep, and soft, like a young bullfrog. &#x201c;Why, if he suffers from our hostility, does he increase it by constant attacks and insults? I can&#x2019;t say I think much of Dr. Hammergeld&#x2019;s cure, really, Mannon; autism might be preferable. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>She stopped. Osden had come into the main cabin.<br> <br>He looked flayed. His skin was unnaturally white and thin, showing the channels of his blood like a faded road map in red and blue. His Adam&#x2019;s apple, the muscles that circled his mouth, the bones and ligaments of his wrists and hands, all stood out distinctly as if displayed for an anatomy lesson. His hair was pale rust, like long-dried blood. He had eyebrows and lashes, but they were visible only in certain lights; what one saw was the bones of the eye sockets, the veining of the lids, and the colorless eyes. They were not red eyes, for he was not really an albino, but they were not blue or grey; colors had cancelled out in Osden&#x2019;s eyes, leaving a cold water-like clarity, infinitely penetrable. He never looked directly at one. His face lacked expression, like an anatomical drawing, or a skinned face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; he said in a high, harsh tenor, &#x201c;that even autistic withdrawal might be preferable to the smog of cheap secondhand emotions with which you people surround me. What are you sweating hate for now, Porlock? Can&#x2019;t stand the sight of me? Go practice some auto-eroticism the way you were doing last night, it improves your vibes. Who the devil moved my tapes, here? Don&#x2019;t touch my things, any of you. I won&#x2019;t have it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Osden,&#x201d; said Asnanifoil in his large slow voice, &#x201c;why are you such a bastard?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ander Eskwana cowered and put his hands in front of his face. Contention frightened him. Olleroo looked up with a vacant yet eager expression, the eternal spectator.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why shouldn&#x2019;t I be?&#x201d; said Osden. He was not looking at Asnanifoil, and was keeping physically as far away from all of them as he could in the crowded cabin. &#x201c;None of you constitute, in yourselves, any reason for my changing my behavior.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harfex, a reserved and patient man, said, &#x201c;The reason is that we shall be spending several years together. Life will be better for all of us if&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you understand that I don&#x2019;t give a damn for all of you?&#x201d; Osden said, took up his microtapes, and went out. Eskwana had suddenly gone to sleep. Asnanifoil was drawing slipstreams in the air with his finger and muttering the Ritual Primes. &#x201c;You cannot explain his presence on the team except as a plot on the part of the Terran Authority. I saw this almost at once. This mission is meant to fail,&#x201d; Harfex whispered to the Coordinator, glancing over his shoulder. Porlock was fumbling with his fly-button; there were tears in his eyes. I did tell you they were all crazy, but you thought I was exaggerating.<br> <br>All the same, they were not unjustified. Extreme Surveyors expected to find their fellow team members intelligent, well-trained, unstable, and personally sympathetic. They had to work together in close quarters and nasty places, and could expect one another&#x2019;s paranoias, depressions, manias, phobias, and compulsions to be mild enough to admit of good personal relationships, at least most of the time. Osden might be intelligent, but his training was sketchy and his personality was disastrous. He had been sent only on account of his singular gift, the power of empathy: properly speaking, of wide-range bioempathic receptivity. His talent wasn&#x2019;t species-specific; he could pick up emotion or sentience from anything that felt. He could share lust with a white rat, pain with a squashed cockroach, and phototropy with a moth. On an alien world, the Authority had decided, it would be useful to know if anything nearby is sentient, and if so, what its feelings towards you are. Osden&#x2019;s title was a new one: he was the team&#x2019;s Sensor.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is emotion, Osden?&#x201d; Haito Tomiko asked him one day in the main cabin, trying to make some rapport with him for once. &#x201c;What is it, exactly, that you pick up with your empathic sensitivity?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Muck,&#x201d; the man answered in his high, exasperated voice. &#x201c;The psychic excreta of the animal kingdom. I wade through your faeces.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was trying,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;to learn some facts.&#x201d; She thought her tone was admirably calm.<br> <br>&#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t after facts. You were trying to get at me. With some fear, some curiosity, and a great deal of distaste. The way you might poke a dead dog, to see the maggots crawl. Will you understand once and for all that I don&#x2019;t want to be got at, that I want to be left alone?&#x201d; His skin was mottled with red and violet, his voice had risen. &#x201c;Go roll in your own dung, you yellow bitch!&#x201d; he shouted at her silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; she said, still quietly, but she left him at once and went to her cabin. Of course he had been right about her motives; her question had been largely a pretext, a mere effort to interest him. But what harm in that? Did not that effort imply respect for the other? At the moment of asking the question she had felt at most a slight distrust of him; she had mostly felt sorry for him, the poor arrogant venomous bastard, Mr. No-Skin as Olleroo called him. What did he expect, the way he acted? Love?<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess he can&#x2019;t stand anybody feeling sorry for him,&#x201d; said Olleroo, lying on the lower bunk, gilding her nipples.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then he can&#x2019;t form any human relationship. All his Dr. Hammergeld did was turn an autism inside out. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Poor frot,&#x201d; said Olleroo. &#x201c;Tomiko, you don&#x2019;t mind if Harfex comes in for a while tonight, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you go to his cabin? I&#x2019;m sick of always having to sit in Main with that damned peeled turnip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You do hate him, don&#x2019;t you? I guess he feels that. But I slept with Harfex last night too, and Asnanifoil might get jealous, since they share the cabin. It would be nicer here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Service them both,&#x201d; Tomiko said with the coarseness of offended modesty. Her Terran subculture, the East Asian, was a puritanical one; she had been brought up chaste.<br> <br>&#x201c;I only like one a night,&#x201d; Olleroo replied with innocent serenity. Beldene, the Garden Planet, had never discovered chastity, or the wheel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Try Osden, then,&#x201d; Tomiko said. Her personal instability was seldom so plain as now: a profound self-distrust manifesting itself as destructivism. She had volunteered for this job because there was, in all probability, no use in doing it.<br> <br>The little Beldene looked up, paintbrush in hand, eyes wide. &#x201c;Tomiko, that was a dirty thing to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would be vile! I&#x2019;m not attracted to Osden!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it mattered to you,&#x201d; Tomiko said indifferently, though she did know. She got some papers together and left the cabin, remarking, &#x201c;I hope you and Harfex or whoever it is finish by last bell; I&#x2019;m tired.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olleroo was crying, tears dripping on her little gilded nipples. She wept easily. Tomiko had not wept since she was ten years old.<br> <br>It was not a happy ship; but it took a turn for the better when Asnanifoil and his computers raised World 4470. There it lay, a dark-green jewel, like truth at the bottom of a gravity well. As they watched the jade disc grow, a sense of mutuality grew among them. Osden&#x2019;s selfishness, his accurate cruelty, served now to draw the others together. &#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Mannon said, &#x201c;he was sent as a beating-gron. What Terrans call a scapegoat. Perhaps his influence will be good after all.&#x201d; And no one, so careful were they to be kind to one another, disagreed.<br> <br>They came into orbit. There were no lights on nightside, on the continents none of the lines and clots made by animals who build.<br> <br>&#x201c;No men,&#x201d; Harfex murmured.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; snapped Osden, who had a viewscreen to himself, and his head inside a polythene bag. He claimed that the plastic cut down on the empathic noise he received from the others. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re two lightcenturies past the limit of t...</p><h2>Disaster Spiritual Care, 2nd Edition: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional and National Tragedy</h2><p><i>The first comprehensive resource for pastoral care in the face of disaster&#x2015;a vital resource for clergy, seminarians, pastoral counselors and caregivers of all faith traditions. Updated and expanded!</i><i></i>This essential resource for clergy and caregivers integrates the classic foundations of pastoral care with the unique challenges of disaster response on community, regional and national levels.<br><br>Offering the latest theological perspectives and tools&#x2015;along with basic theory and skills from the best disaster response texts, research and concepts&#x2015;the contributors to this resource are innovators in their fields and represent Christianity, Judaism, Islam and more.<br><br><b>The Structure of This Book</b><b></b>The second edition of this book is divided into three sections. The &nbsp;first is focused on National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster&nbsp;(NVOAD) and their seminal disaster spiritual care documents; the second section is chronological; the third focuses on a variety of issues that are not time related. Chapters in the second and third sections are written by a cross section of leaders in this developing eld who come from a wide range of religions and cultures.<br>The first section focuses on the two key NVOAD documents created after the first edition of this book. These documents have become both the starting point and the key guiding reference source for all disaster spiritual care responses. They have become the core of what is expected from both individuals and organizations that provide disaster spiritual care.<br>The second section focuses on disasters as they unfold. The size of a disaster serves as a variable as to the scope of issues that will confront you. We have devoted more than one chapter to some time periods in order to address the needs of you and your faith community for local, regional, and national disasters. We also recognize the multiyear impact of disasters and have developed this book with the intent that it be a resource you can reference over a long period of time or at a single time of urgent need.<br><br>The third section of the book focuses on issues you will face throughout the course of a disaster that will not arise on a set timeline. These topics range from compassion fatigue to how best to pro-vide spiritual care at different stages of human development, recover-ing bodies in the eld and working in a morgue environment, and working with and providing spiritual care to first responders.</p><p>New to this edition are chapters on:<br><ul><li>N-VOAD Points of Consensus and Guidelines<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b>A Developing Conversation</li><li>Ethics in Disaster Spiritual Care</li><li>Assessment</li><li>Developing a Theological Framework for Providing Disaster Spiritual Care</li><li>And More</li></ul><b>Rev.

Furthermore, he was not only a mystic, but a mystic in action: one who combined in himself the contemplative and active dimensions of the God-experience in such a way that he became a Christ-figure for many people.&#x201d;&#x2014;From Chapter Nine<br> <br> Appointed by the Vatican as the &#x201c;External Collaborator to the Relator&#x201d; for the cause of canonization of Capuchin Father Solanus Casey, the first man born in the United States to be declared &#x201c;Venerable&#x201d; by the Catholic church, Michael Crosby gives us an inspiring and insightful story of one person&#x2019;s unswerving faith in God&#x2019;s abiding presence throughout the universe. <br><br> &#x201c;For Solanus,&#x201d; Crosby writes, &#x201c;knowing God demanded a threefold response: appreciation, love, and service. Solanus wrote that everyone&#x2019;s &#x2018;purpose as a rational creature is to recognize and to know his Creator, so as to be able, intelligently to love him, confidently to hope in him, and gratefully to serve him.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> Besides the gift of healing which brought happiness to many, Solanus Casey also used his gift of prophecy to encourage and challenge and to bring back hope to others. But the humble Capuchin&#x2019;s greatest gift was charity&#x2014;charity that not only characterized his happy relationship with God but that overflowed in the warm, caring, fraternal and even humorous way he related to his neighbor.</p><p>MICHAEL CROSBY, O.F.M.

She lives in Dallas, Texas.Chapter One<br><br> High atop a snow-covered hill, the Wyatt mansion perched like a regal crown, its Gothic stone spires pointing skyward, its stained-glass windows glowing like jewels.<br><br> A mile away, limousines and luxury cars paraded in a slow stream toward a uniformed security guard posted at the gated entrance to the estate. As each vehicle reached him, the security guard checked the occupants&#x2019; names off the guest list; then he issued a politely worded edict to the driver: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, because of the snowfall, Mr. Wyatt does not want any vehicles parked inside the gates this evening.&#x201d;<br><br> If a chauffeur was at the wheel, the guard stepped aside, allowing the chauffeur to turn into the drive, proceed through the gates, and deliver his passengers to the house before returning to the main road to park and wait.<br><br> If the vehicle&#x2019;s owner was at the wheel, the guard motioned him toward a line of shiny black Range Rovers parked up the hill at a cross street, wisps of exhaust curling from their tailpipes. &#x201c;Please pull forward and leave your car with an attendant,&#x201d; the guard instructed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be shuttled up to the house.&#x201d;<br><br> However, as each new arrival soon discovered, that process was neither as simple nor as convenient as it sounded. Although there were plenty of helpful attendants and available Range Rovers waiting within sight, large snowbanks and parked cars had encroached on the winding residential lane so that it was almost impassably narrow in places, and the steady procession of slow-moving vehicles had churned four inches of unplowed snow from earlier that day into thick slush.<br><br> The whole ordeal was unnerving and annoying to every- one. . . . Everyone except Detectives Childress and MacNeil, who were in an unmarked Chevrolet that was backed into a driveway one hundred and fifty yards uphill from the entrance to the Wyatt estate. The two detectives were part of a handpicked team, formed earlier that day, assigned to keep Mitchell Wyatt under twenty-four-hour surveillance.<br><br> At eight pm, they had tailed him here, to Cecil Wyatt&#x2019;s estate, where he swerved around the security guard who was trying to wave him down, then turned into the private drive and disappeared from sight. Once Wyatt vanished, there was nothing for Childress and MacNeil to do but park and make a record of whom he was associating with. To facilitate that, Childress was observing the scene through a pair of night-vision binoculars, reporting license-plate numbers and miscellaneous information to MacNeil, who wrote it down in a notebook.<br><br> &#x201c;We have a new contender approaching the starting line,&#x201d; Childress murmured as another pair of headlights reached the security guard at the gate. He read the vehicle&#x2019;s license plate aloud for MacNeil; then he described the vehicle and driver. &#x201c;White Mercedes AMG, this year&#x2019;s model, or possibly last year&#x2019;s. Driver is a Caucasian male in his early sixties, passenger is a Caucasian female, early thirties, and she&#x2019;s snuggled up against her smiling sugar daddy.&#x201d;<br><br> When MacNeil didn&#x2019;t reply, Childress glanced at him and realized MacNeil&#x2019;s attention was focused on a pair of headlights slowly descending the hill from the right. &#x201c;Must be someone who lives up here,&#x201d; Childress remarked. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s not only rich, he&#x2019;s curious,&#x201d; he added as the black Lincoln Town Car came to a full stop and cut off its headlights directly in front of the driveway where they were parked.<br><br> The back door opened, and a man in his late thirties wearing a dark overcoat got out. Childress rolled down his window, intending to make an excuse for their presence, but as the man paused and put his cell phone to his ear, Childress recognized him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Gray Elliott. What&#x2019;s he doing out here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He lives nearby. Maybe he&#x2019;s attending the party.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Or maybe he wants to pitch in and do some surveillance with us,&#x201d; Childress joked, but there was admiration in his voice. After only one year in office as Cook County&#x2019;s state&#x2019;s attorney, Gray Elliott was a hero to the cops&#x2014;a brilliant attorney who wasn&#x2019;t afraid to take on tough, risky cases. The fact that he was also a wealthy socialite who&#x2019;d dedicated himself to public service rather than the pursuit of greater wealth added another facet to his heroic image.<br><br> MacNeil liked him for all of those reasons but MacNeil had always liked Gray&#x2014;even when he had been a carefree, reckless teenager whom MacNeil had busted for several minor youthful offenses.<br><br> Elliott finished his phone call, walked over to the car, leaned down, and looked inside. &#x201c;You must be Childress,&#x201d; he said by way of greeting; then he shifted his attention to MacNeil. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a word with you, Mac.&#x201d;<br><br> MacNeil got out and joined him at the back of the car. The wind had died down, and the engine was running, pumping warm exhaust at their feet. &#x201c;I asked that you be assigned to this case,&#x201d; Gray told him, &#x201c;because you headed the investigation into William Wyatt&#x2019;s disappearance, and you&#x2019;re familiar with all the players.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not all of them,&#x201d; Mac interrupted, unable to keep his curiosity in check. &#x201c;I never heard of Mitchell Wyatt until today. Who the hell is he, and why are we watching him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s William Wyatt&#x2019;s half brother, and I believe he&#x2019;s responsible for William&#x2019;s disappearance.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;His half brother?&#x201d; MacNeil repeated, his forehead furrowing into a doubtful frown. &#x201c;When William disappeared, I interviewed all his family members and all his friends. No one ever mentioned a half brother. In fact, when I interviewed Cecil Wyatt, the old man repeatedly told me how important it was that we find his only grandson, and bring William home to his wife and kid.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You were deliberately misled by an arrogant, devious old man who wasn&#x2019;t ready to admit he had a grandson he&#x2019;d never acknowledged. I&#x2019;ve known the Wyatts my whole life, and I never knew William had a half brother. For that matter, neither did William until this past June.<br><br> &#x201c;According to the story I was just told, William&#x2019;s father, Edward, had an affair with his secretary when William was a couple years old and his mother was dying of cancer. The secretary got pregnant, and William&#x2019;s mother died a few months later, but when the secretary pressed Edward to marry her as he&#x2019;d promised, he stalled, then denied the baby was his. She retaliated by threatening to take the whole sordid tale to the Tribune.&#x201d;<br><br> Elliott&#x2019;s cell phone rang, and he paused to glance at the caller&#x2019;s name; then he ignored the call and continued. &#x201c;At the time, Cecil had big political plans for Edward, which a scandal would have destroyed, but allowing &#x2018;a common little tart&#x2019; to marry into the family was unthinkable. Cecil tried to buy her off, but she wouldn&#x2019;t budge about her child&#x2019;s right to be legitimate, to be named Wyatt, and to be raised as a Wyatt. She hired a lawyer, and eventually a deal was struck: Edward would marry her shortly before the baby was due, and then divorce her immediately after the birth. She relinquished all rights to the baby, granting full custody to Cecil. Cecil, in turn, was obliged to see that the baby was raised &#x2018;with all the benefits associated with Wyatt money and social connections,&#x2019; including the finest education, travel abroad, and so forth. She received a substantial sum of money on the condition that she never divulge a word about anything that had happened and never again have contact with any of the parties involved, including the baby.&#x201d;<br><br> MacNeil turned the collar up on his jacket. The bottom half of his body was reasonably warm, but his ears were freezing. &#x201c;Obviously, Cecil later changed his mind about the grandson,&#x201d; he said, rubbing his hands together before he stuck them in his pockets.<br><br> &#x201c;No, he adhered to the letter of the agreement but not the spirit. He&#x2019;d agreed Mitchell would grow up &#x2018;with all the benefits associated with Wyatt money and social connections,&#x2019; but Cecil never specifically agreed that the &#x2018;social connections&#x2019; would be with the Wyatts themselves. A week after he was born, Cecil sent Mitchell to a family in Italy, along with a falsified birth certificate. When he was four or five, Cecil yanked him out of that family&#x2019;s home and had him sent to an exclusive boarding school in France. Later, Mitchell was sent to prep school in Switzerland, and then on to Oxford.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did the kid even know who he was, or who was paying for his fancy education?&#x201d; MacNeil asked.<br><br> &#x201c;The family he lived with in Italy told him what they&#x2019;d been told, which was that he&#x2019;d been abandoned as a newborn on a California doorstep and that his name was merely a combination of two names picked out of a phone book by a group of generous American benefactors who regularly put up the money to support and educate boys just like him. These supposed benefactors wished for nothing in return except the right to remain anonymous.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jeez.&#x201d; MacNeil shook his head.<br><br> &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s pity I hear, save it for someone who deserves it,&#x201d; Elliott said sarcastically. &#x201c;From all accounts, young Mitchell enjoyed his life and made the most of his opportunities. He was a natural athlete who excelled at sports, he went to the finest schools, and he mixed easily with kids from Europe&#x2019;s leading families. After he graduated from college, he put his education, his good looks, and his acquired social contacts to excellent use, managing to make himself a load of money. He&#x2019;s thirty-four now, and he runs companies based mostly in Europe. He has apartments in Rome, London, Paris, and New York.&#x201d; Elliott paused to look at his watch, frowning as he tried to see its face in the dark. &#x201c;Can you see the time on your watch?&#x201d;<br><br> MacNeil pulled up his sleeve and glanced at the large glowing green numerals on his Timex. &#x201c;Eight forty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have to go. I need to put in an appearance at Cecil&#x2019;s party.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How did Wyatt end up right here, right now, after all this time?&#x201d; MacNeil said quickly, trying to make optimal use of the remaining time.<br><br> &#x201c;Seven months ago, in early June, William came across the documents in an old safe, and he was outraged at the treatment his poor half brother had received from his father and grandfather. He hired detectives, and when they located Mitchell Wyatt in London, William took his wife and his son and flew to London to introduce them in person and explain what had happened.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That was a nice thing to do.&#x201d;<br><br> Elliott tipped his head back and looked at the sky. &#x201c;Yes, it was,&#x201d; he said in the carefully controlled voice of a man trying not to betray any emotion. &#x201c;William was a thoroughly nice guy&#x2014;the only male in his family for generations who wasn&#x2019;t an egotistical sociopath.&#x201d; Abruptly, he looked back at MacNeil and finished. &#x201c;When William came back from London filled with glowing accounts of Mitchell&#x2019;s amazing successes, Edward didn&#x2019;t want anything to do with his long-lost son, but old Cecil was evidently impressed enough to ask for a meeting. The meeting took place in August, when Mitchell was supposedly here on business. And then, after William disappeared in November, Cecil asked Mitchell to come back to Chicago so they could get to know each other better. Ironically, the old man is now quite taken with his prodigal grandson&#x2014;so much so that he&#x2019;s asked him to be present tonight, for his eightieth birthday party. I have to get going,&#x201d; he said, already starting toward his car.<br><br> MacNeil walked beside him. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t told me anything that explains why we&#x2019;re keeping Mitchell Wyatt under surveillance.&#x201d;<br><br> Elliott stopped abruptly, his expression tight, his voice cold and clipped. &#x201c;Oh, did I leave that out?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Here are just two of the reasons: In September, one month after that first reunion between Cecil and Mitchell, Edward&#x2014;William and Mitchell&#x2019;s father&#x2014;&#x2018;fell&#x2019; off his balcony and plunged thirty stories to his death. In November, William vanished. Coincidentally, according to U.S. passport and immigration records, Mitchell Wyatt entered the U.S. shortly before each event occurred and departed almost immediately afterward.&#x201d;<br><br> When MacNeil&#x2019;s eyes narrowed, Elliott said, &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re getting part of the picture. Here&#x2019;s more of it: Mitchell has been in Chicago for two weeks. He&#x2019;s staying at William&#x2019;s house, consoling William&#x2019;s beautiful wife, and befriending William&#x2019;s fourteen-year-old son.&#x201d; Unable to keep the loathing from his voice, Elliott said, &#x201c;Mitchell Wyatt is systematically exterminating members of his own family and restructuring the family to suit himself.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s after the family fortune,&#x201d; MacNeil concluded.<br><br> &#x201c;I think the Wyatt genes have produced another sociopath. The ultimate sociopath&#x2014;a cold-blooded murderer.&#x201d;<br><br> When he walked away, MacNeil got back into the Chevy with Childress, and they watched Elliott&#x2019;s town car stop at the intersection and wait while a group of party guests were transferred into Range Rovers. A gray-haired woman slipped in the slush, and her husband grabbed for her. A middle-aged couple shivered in the cold while a nervous elderly couple struggled to step up onto the Range Rover&#x2019;s elevated running boards with the help of parking attendants.<br><br> &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Childress said, when the vehicles were finally on their way, &#x201c;when we drove past the security gates tonight, I got a look at the driveway leading to the house, and I swear it looked perfectly clear&#x2014;at least as far as I could see.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It was,&#x201d; MacNeil agreed.<br><br> &#x201c;Then why in the hell is the security guard making everyone leave their vehicles out here on the main road?&#x201d;<br><br> MacNeil shrugged. &#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d;</p><h2>Making Shoji</h2><p>The construction of shoji--Japanese sliding doors--requires intricate skills and attention to detail.

But true mercy only arrived at night, a breeze chilled by the vacant desert, moistened by the humming sea, a reluctant guest silently passing through the empty streets, vague about how far it was allowed to roam in this realm of the absolute star. And it was rising now, this star, as faithful as ever, chasing away the blessed breeze. It was almost morning. <br><br>The window in her bedroom was wide open, the glue tree outside it silent, its green shy in the early light. She hadn't fallen asleep until the sky was gray with dawn. And even then I was so rattled I couldn't leave her side, wondering if, like one of those hand puppets that play dead, she would bounce up again, light another cigarette and continue begging me, as she had been doing only minutes before, not to tell, not to tell. <br><br>Baba never found out about Mama's illness; she only fell ill when he was away on business. It was as if, when the world was empty of him, she and I remained as stupid reminders, empty pages that had to be filled with the memory of how they had come to be married. <br><br>I sat watching her beautiful face, her chest rise and fall with breath, unable to leave her side, hearing the things she had just told me swim and repeat in my head. <br><br>Eventually I left her and went to bed. <br><br>When she woke up she came to me. I felt her weight sink beside me, then her fingers in my hair. The sound of her fingernails on my scalp reminded me of once when I was unlucky. I had thrown a date in my mouth before splitting it open, only discovering it was infested with ants when their small shell bodies crackled beneath my teeth. I lay there silent, pretending to be asleep, listening to her breath disturbed by tears. <br><br>During breakfast I tried to say as little as possible. My silence made her nervous. She talked about what we might have for lunch. She asked if I would like some jam or honey. I said no, but she went to the fridge and got some anyway. Then, as was usual on the mornings after she had been ill, she took me on a drive to pull me out of my silence, to return me to myself again. <br><br>Waiting for the car to warm up, she turned on the radio, skipped through the dial and didn't stop until she heard the beautiful voice of Abd al-Basit Abd al-Sammad. I was glad because, as everyone knows, one must refrain from speaking and listen humbly to the Koran when it is read. <br><br>Just before we turned into Gergarish Street, the street that follows the sea, Bahloul the beggar appeared out of nowhere. Mama hit the brakes and said <i>ya satir</i>. He wandered over to her side, walking slowly, clasping his dirty hands tightly to his stomach, his lips quivering. "Hello, Bahloul," Mama said, rummaging in her purse. "I see you, I see you," he said, and although these were the words Bahloul most often uttered, this time I thought what an idiot Bahloul is and wished he would just vanish. I watched him in the side mirror standing in the middle of the street, clutching the money Mama had given him to his chest like a man who has just caught a butterfly. <br><br>She took me downtown to the sesame man in the market by Martyrs' Square, the square that looked on to the sea, the square where a sculpture of Septimius Severus, the Roman emperor born all those years ago in Lepcis, proudly stood. She bought me as many sesame sticks as I wanted, each wrapped in white wax paper twisted at either end. I refused to let her put them in her bag. On such mornings I was always stubborn. "But I have some more shopping to do," she said. "You're bound to drop them like this." "No," I said, curling my eyebrows, "I'll wait for you outside," and walked off angrily, not caring if I lost her or became lost from her in the big city. "Listen," she called after me, attracting people's attention. "Wait for me by Septimius Severus." <br><br>There was a large caf� on one side that spilled out on to the passageway. Men, some faces I recognized from before, sat playing dominoes and cards. Their eyes were on Mama. I wondered if her dress shouldn't be looser. <br><br>As I walked away from her I felt my power over her recede; I began to feel sorry and sad how on such mornings she was always generous and embarrassed and shy, as if she had walked out naked. I wanted to run to her, to hold her hand, latch on to her dress as she shopped and dealt with the world, a world full of men and the greed of men. I forced myself not to look back and focused instead on the shops set within arched bays on either side of the covered passageway. Black silk scarves billowed gently above one, columns of stacked red caps stood as tall as men outside another. The ceiling was made with dark strips of fabric. The white blades of light that pierced through the occasional gaps illuminated the swimming dust and shone still and beautiful on the arches and floor, but darted like sparkles on the heads and down the bodies of the passersby, making the shadows seem much darker than they were. <br><br>Outside, the square was flooded with sunlight. The ground was almost white with brightness, making the dark shoes and figures crossing it look like things floating above the world. I wished I had left the sesame sticks with her. Small needles were now pricking my arms. I told myself off for being stubborn and for letting her buy me so many. I looked at them in my arms and felt no appetite for them. <br><br>I leaned against the cool marble pedestal of Septimius Severus. The Roman emperor stood above me, his silver-studded belt curving below his belly, pointing his arm toward the sea, "Urging Libya to look toward Rome," was how Ustath Rashid described the pose. Ustath Rashid taught art history at el-Fateh University and was my best friend Kareem's father. I remembered our Guide standing in one of his military uniforms like this, waving his arm as the tanks passed in front of him on Revolution Day. <br><br>I turned toward the sea, the shining turquoise sea beyond the square. It seemed like a giant blue monster rising at the edge of the world. "Grrr," I growled, then wondered if anyone had heard me. I kicked my heel against the pedestal several times. I stared at the ground, into the heat and brightness that made me want to sleep with my eyes open. But then, not looking for but falling directly on my target, I spotted Baba. <br><br>He was standing on the edge of the pavement in a street opposite the square, looking both ways for traffic, arching forward as if he was about to fall. Before he stepped on to the road he motioned with his hand then snapped his fingers twice. It was a gesture that I knew. Sometimes he would wave to me like that, as if to say, "Come on, come on," then snap his fingers, "Hey, wake up." Behind him appeared Nasser, Baba's office clerk, carrying a small shiny black typewriter beneath his arm, struggling to keep up. Baba was already crossing the street, walking toward me. For a moment I thought he might be bringing Nasser to Septimius Severus, to teach him all the things he had taught me about the Roman emperor, Lepcis Magna and Rome. For Baba regarded Nasser as a younger brother; he often said so himself. <br><br>"Baba?" I whispered. <br><br>Two dark lenses curved like the humpbacks of turtles over his eyes. The sky, the sun and the sea were painted by God in colors we could all point at and say the sea is turquoise, the sun banana, the sky blue. Sunglasses are terrible, I thought, because they change all of this and keep those who wear them at a distance. At that moment I remembered how, only a couple of days ago, he had kissed us good-bye. "May God bring you back safely," Mama told him, "and make your trip profitable." I had kissed his hand like he taught me to. He had leaned down and whispered in my ear, "Take care of your mother, you are the man of the house now," and grinned at me in the way people do when they think they have paid you a compliment. But look now, look; walking where I could touch him, here where we should be together. My heart quickened. He was coming closer. Maybe he means me, I thought. It was impossible to see his eyes. <br><br>I watched him walk in that familiar way&#x2013;his head pointing up slightly, his polished leather shoes flicking ahead with every step&#x2013;hoping he would call my name, wave his hand, snap his fingers. I swear if he had I would have leaped into his arms. When he was right there, close enough that if I extended my arm I could touch him, I held my breath and my ears filled with silence. I watched his solemn expression&#x2013;an expression I admired and feared&#x2013;caught the scent-edge of his cologne, felt the air swell round him as he walked past. He was immediately followed by Nasser, carrying the black shiny typewriter under one arm. I wished I was him, following Baba like a shadow. They entered one of the buildings overlooking the square. It was a white building with green shutters. Green was the color of the revolution, but you rarely saw shutters painted in it. <br><br>"Didn't I tell you to wait by the sculpture?" I heard Mama say from behind me. I looked back and saw that I had strayed far from Septimius Severus. <br><br>I felt sick, anxious that I had somehow done the wrong thing. Baba wasn't on a business trip, but here, in Tripoli, where we should be together. I could have reached out and caught him from where he was heading; why had I not acted? <br><br>I sat in the car while she loaded the shopping, still holding on to the sesame sticks. I looked up at the building Baba and Nasser had entered. A window on the top floor shuddered, then swung open. Baba appeared through it. He gazed at the square, no longer wearing the sunglasses, leaning with his hands on the sill like a leader waiting for the clapping and chanting to stop. He hung a small red towel on the clothesline and disappeared inside. <br><br>On the way home I was more silent than before, and this time there was no effort in it. As soon as we left Martyrs' Square Mama began craning her neck toward the rearview mirror. Stopping at the next traffic light, she whispered a prayer to herself. A car stopped so close beside us I could have touched the driver's cheek. Four men dressed in dark safari suits sat looking at us. At first I didn't recognize them, then I remembered. I remembered so suddenly I felt my heart jump. They were the same Revolutionary Committee men who had come a week before and taken Ustath Rashid. <br><br>Mama looked ahead, her back a few centimeters away from the backrest, her fists tight around the steering wheel. She released one hand, brought it to my knee and sternly whispered, "Face forward." <br><br>When the traffic light turned green, the car beside us didn't move. Everyone knows you mustn't overtake a Revolutionary Committee car, and if you have to, then you must do it discreetly, without showing any pleasure in it. A few cars, unaware of who was parked beside us, began to sound their horns. Mama drove off slowly, looking more at the rearview mirror than the road ahead. Then she said, "They are following us; don't look back." I stared at my bare knees and said the same prayer over and over. I felt the sweat gather between my palms and the wax-paper wrapping of the sesame sticks. It wasn't until we were almost home that Mama said, "OK, they are gone," then mumbled to herself, "Nothing better to do than give us an escort, the rotten rats." <br><br>My heart eased and my back grew taller. The prayer left my lips. <br><br>The innocent, Sheikh Mustafa, the imam of our local mosque, had told me, have no cause to fear; only the guilty live in fear. <br><br>I didn't help her carry the shopping into the house as was usual. I went straight to my room and dropped the sesame sticks on the bed, shaking the blood back into my arms. I grabbed my picture book on Lepcis Magna. Ten days before I had visited the ancient city for the first and, as it turned out, last time. Images of the deserted city of ruins by the sea still lingered vividly in my mind. I longed to return to it. <br><br>I didn't come out until I had to: after she had prepared lunch and set the table and called my name. <br><br>When she tore the bread, she handed me a piece; and I, noticing she hadn't had any salad, passed her the salad bowl. Midway through the meal she got up and turned on the radio. She left it on a man talking about farming the desert. I got up, said, "Bless your hands," and went to my room. "I will take a nap," she said after me. My silence made her say things she didn't need to say, she always took a nap in the afternoons, everyone did, everyone except me. I never could nap. <br><br>I waited in my room until she had finished washing the dishes and putting away the food, until I was certain she had gone to sleep, then I came out. <br><br>I was walking around the house looking for something to do when the telephone rang. I ran to it before it could wake her up. It was Baba. On hearing his voice my heart quickened. I thought he must be calling so soon after I had seen him to explain why he hadn't greeted me. <br><br>"Where are you?" <br><br>"Abroad. Let me speak to your mother." <br><br>"Where abroad?" <br><br>"Abroad," he repeated, as if it was obvious where that was. "I'll be home tomorrow." <br><br>"I miss you." <br><br>"Me too. Call your mother." <br><br>"She's asleep. Shall I wake her up?" <br><br>"Just let her know I'll be home tomorrow, about lunch-time." <br><br>I didn't want the conversation to end so I said, "We were followed today by that same white car that took Ustath Rashid. We were side by side at the traffic light and I saw their faces. I was so close I could have touched the driver's cheek and I wasn't frightened. Not at all. Not even a little, I wasn't." <br><br>"I'll see you tomorrow," he said and hung up. <br><br>I stood for a while beside the telephone and listened to the thick silence that seemed to descend on our house during those hours in the afternoon, a silence edged by the humming of the fridge in the kitchen and the ticking of the clock in the hallway. <br><br>I went to watch Mama sleep. I sat beside her, checking first that her chest was rising and falling with breath. I remembered the words she had told me the night before, "We are two halves of the same soul, two open pages of the same book," words that felt like a gift I didn't want.</p><h2>The Supreme Court</h2><p><b>The sixteenth Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist&#x2019;s classic book offers a lively and accessible history of the Supreme Court. </b><br><br>Chief Justice Rehnquist&#x2019;s engaging writing illuminates both the high and low points in the Court's history, from Chief Justice Marshall&#x2019;s dominance of the Court during the early nineteenth century through the landmark decisions of the Warren Court. Citing cases such as the Dred Scott decision and Roosevelt's Court-packing plan, Rehnquist makes clear that the Court does not operate in a vacuum, that the justices are unavoidably influenced by their surroundings, and that their decisions have real and lasting impacts on our society. The public often hears little about the Supreme Court until decisions are handed down. Here, Rehnquist reveals its inner workings--the process by which cases are chosen, the nature of the conferences where decisions are made, and the type of debates that take place. With grace and wit, this incisive history gives a dynamic and informative account of the most powerful court in the nation and how it has shaped the direction America has taken.</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist sets a simple goal for himself: "This book is designed to convey to the interested, informed layman, as well as lawyers who do not specialize in constitutional law, a better understanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American government." He succeeds fabulously. <i>The Supreme Court</i>, an updated version of a book originally published in 1987, is a succinct and readable account of the Court's past and present. Rehnquist avoids getting bogged down in the minutia of particular cases, even as he deftly covers the details of several extremely important ones, such as <i>Marbury v. Madison</i> and <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i>. <p> The most interesting parts of the book explain how the current Court goes about its business. In these fascinating chapters, Rehnquist consistently includes nifty touches, such as how his law clerks decide who gets to work on which cases and the strict seating protocol that is followed when the nine justices--and nobody else--sit in conference to discuss their votes. If there's a knock on the door, it's the most junior justice who must answer. They don't really discuss cases at all during these meetings, but rather state their views. "I do not believe that conference discussion changes many votes," writes the Chief Justice. Oral arguments, on the other hand, are different: "In a significant minority of the cases in which I have heard oral argument, I have left the bench feeling differently about a case than I did when I came to the bench." </p><p> Rehnquist briefly lays out his own theory of jurisprudence in a short concluding chapter: "Go beyond the language of the Constitution, and the meaning that may be fairly ascribed to the language, and into the consciences of individual judges, is to embark on a journey that is treacherous indeed." Yet <i>The Supreme Court</i> largely skips comment on existing controversies, such as abortion rights, race-based policies, or the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. The book is exactly what Rehnquist promises: An accessible and enlightening introduction to a vital institution. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>tion of Chief Justice William H.

We have a common ancestor, scientists tell us, so it&#x2019;s natural that we act alike. But not all of these parallels are so appealing: the chimpanzee, for example, can be as vicious and manipulative as any human.</p><p>Yet there&#x2019;s more to our shared primate heritage than just our violent streak. In <b>Our Inner Ape</b>, Frans de Waal, one of the world&#x2019;s great primatologists and a renowned expert on social behavior in apes, presents the provocative idea that our noblest qualities generosity, kindness, altruism are as much a part of our nature as are our baser instincts. After all, we share them with another primate: the lesser-known bonobo. As genetically similar to man as the chimpanzee, the bonobo has a temperament and a lifestyle vastly different from those of its genetic cousin. Where chimps are aggressive, territorial, and hierarchical, bonobos are gentle, loving, and erotic (sex for bonobos is as much about pleasure and social bonding as it is about reproduction).</p><p>While the parallels between chimp brutality and human brutality are easy to see, de Waal suggests that the conciliatory bonobo is just as legitimate a model to study when we explore our primate heritage. He even connects humanity&#x2019;s desire for fairness and its morality with primate behavior, offering a view of society that contrasts markedly with the caricature people have of Darwinian evolution. It&#x2019;s plain that our finest qualities run deeper in our DNA than experts have previously thought.</p><p>Frans de Waal has spent the last two decades studying our closest primate relations, and his observations of each species in <b>Our Inner Ape</b> encompass the spectrum of human behavior. This is an audacious book, an engrossing discourse that proposes thought-provoking and sometimes shocking connections among chimps, bonobos, and those most paradoxical of apes, human beings.</p></p><p>Power, sex, violence and kindness: these four broad-spectrum categories encompass much of human behavior, so it's only fitting that they're also the primary subject material for Frans de Waal's (<i>The Ape and The Sushi Master</i>) book <i>Our Inner Ape</i>. The few (but deeply detailed) chapters are a mesmerizing read that spans biology, child psychology, postmodern theorists and fundamental morality, using tales of stern chimps, and sexy bonobos to examine humans' place between them. In the process, he examines why we need to know our place in the world, how our body language communicates feelings, and where the roots of empathy lie in mammalian life. <p> De Waal's respect for both his readers and his research subjects come shining through in the simple clarity he uses when describing both the endless sex of bonobo apes and the heartrending violence occasionally present in chimp hierarchal structure. By illustrating his points with a mixture of straight-from-research experiences and jokes at the expense of modern politicians, he keeps his ideas compelling for anyone with a basic understanding of evolutionary science without drifting towards the academic drone that could be expected of by a researcher of his experience. </p><p> You won't find specific conclusions concerning human nature, but instead a gentle, almost rambling look at two primate species with vastly different social networks and how, perhaps, humanity can learn from each to our benefit. A few of de Waal's lovely duotone photos (<i>My Family Album: 30 Years of Primate Photography</i> grace the end of the book, featuring close-up shots of the folks he's been writing about--chimps like Yeroen, Nikkie and Mama, and bonobo Kuif and adopted daughter Roosje are downright thrilling to see after reading such interesting stories about their lives. <i>Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Frans de Waal</b>&nbsp;is a Dutch-born biologist who lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia.

For a buck ninety-five they served up eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast, plus all the coffee a body could drink. Russ Palmer was hungrier than a bear in springtime, but food wasn't the only thing on his mind.<p>He wanted company&#x2014;of the female variety. "Mornin', Russ," Mary Andrews, the lone waitress, called out when he walked into the restaurant. Her greeting was followed by a chorus from several other ranchers.</p><p>Russ removed his black Stetson and hooked it on the peg by the door. Although it was only a few days into September, the air was decidedly cool and he'd worn his blanket-lined denim jacket.</p><p>Sliding into the booth with a couple of friends, Russ picked up the tail end of what Bill Shepherd was saying. "Pretty as a picture."</p><p>Russ's interest was instantly piqued. "Who?"</p><p>"The new schoolteacher, Taylor Manning," Harry Donovan answered eagerly. At twenty-three Harry still had the peach-faced immaturity of youth and fine, blond hair he couldn't seem to control.</p><p>A schoolteacher. Russ's curiosity level fell several notches. "Taylor's a funny name for a woman," he muttered, reaching for the menu, which was tucked between the sugar container and the salt and pepper shakers.</p><p>"The missus and I met her yesterday," Bill went on to say. "She rented old man Halloran's place on the edge of town."</p><p>Russ nodded as he scanned the menu. He ordered the "special" every Saturday morning, but he liked to see what was offered in case something else struck his fancy.</p><p>"She moved here from Seattle," Harry informed Russ enthusiastically.</p><p>"Then she's a city girl," Russ said, and a hint of sarcasm slipped into his voice. The kid had it bad. Personally Russ didn't hold out much hope of the new teacher sticking it out past Christmas. Seattle was known for its mild climate. At best Taylor Manning could deal with four or five days of drizzle, but he'd bet his ranch and five hundred head of cattle that she had no idea what a Montana winter could be like. "Whether she's a city slicker or not, I couldn't rightly say," Harry said with no lack of fervor, "but I can tell you one thing. She's real pretty. I swear she's got the bluest eyes I've ever seen and dark, silky hair that falls to about here." He gestured with his hand to a point well below his shoulder blades. "A man could see himself running his fingers through hair that soft," he said dreamily. Pink tinged Harry's cheeks as he stopped abruptly and cast a self-conscious look at his two friends.</p><p>Russ laughed outright. "Hell, Harry, she hasn't even been in town a week and already you're sweet on her."</p><p>"I can't help myself." Harry grabbed his mug so fast he nearly spilled his coffee. "Wait until you meet her yourself, then you'll know what I mean."</p><p>"I'm not going to be mooning over any school-marm," Russ told the two men. He hadn't gotten to the age of thirty-four safely unmarried only to be taken in by the charms of a citified schoolteacher. Especially one Harry Donovan would fantasize about.</p><p>Bill and Harry exchanged glances, then Harry snickered loudly, apparently amused by Russ's attitude. "You just wait till you see her yourself," he said again.</p><p>"What do you mean I can't use myAmerican Express card here?" Taylor Manning demanded of the clerk at the small store. "I could use this card in Kodiak, Alaska!" </p><p>"I'm really sorry," the older woman said, "but as far as I know, no one in town takes American Express."</p><p>Shaking her head, Taylor pulled her Visa card from her wallet and set it on the counter. "I'll use this one instead." She pushed her chocolate-brown hair over her shoulder and looked around. This situation was becoming embarrassing. Taylor had used her meager savings to rent the house. She'd gone shopping for some kitchen things she was going to need, thinking she could use her credit card and pay for them when it was more convenient.</p><p>She was grateful there were only two other people in the store. A cowboy and his daughter. No, Taylor decided on second thought. The teenage girl was too old to be his daughter, but too young to be his girlfriend.</p><p>"I'm very sorry, but we don't take Visa, either."</p><p>"You don't take Visa," Taylor echoed in shocked disbelief. "Everyone takes Visa."</p><p>"No one in Cougar Point," the woman said apologetically.</p><p>Taylor smiled blandly. "Then what do you take?" </p><p>"Cash would work."</p><p>Taylor rummaged through her purse, drawing out a checkbook. She studied the meager balance and sighed inwardly. "I don't suppose you take out-of-state checks, do you? Don't answer that," she said quickly. "Anyone who doesn't honor American Express or Visa isn't going to take a check from a Seattle bank." She stared down at the few items longingly and made her decision. "I'll simply put everything back and wait until the checks come through from my new account." She'd also have to wait until she'd deposited her first pay two weeks from now, but she didn't feel announcing that was necessary.</p><p>"I'm really sorry, miss."</p><p>Taylor nodded. "No problem," she murmured, and even managed a respectable smile. She turned, nearly colliding with the cowboy she'd noticed earlier.</p><p>"Oh, sorry," she said, slipping past him.</p><p>"Just a minute. Did I hear you mention Seattle?" His voice was deep and masculine. Without giving her a chance to respond, he added, "You wouldn't happen to be Taylor Manning, would you?"</p><p>"Yes. How'd you know?" Not that she should be surprised. Folks had been introducing themselves all week, telling her how pleased they were that she'd accepted the teaching assignment in their town.</p><p>Setting his black Stetson farther back on his head, the rancher explained. "The kid mentioned something about you this morning over breakfast."</p><p>"The kid?"</p><p>"Harry Donovan."</p><p>Taylor didn't recall meeting any youngster by that name, but there'd been so many names and so many faces that she'd long since lost track.</p><p>The cowboy smiled, and their eyes held for a moment. His reaction hinted at curiosity, but for her part, Taylor had no feelings one way or the other. Oh, he was good-looking enough. His head was covered with a crisp black Stetson; all the men in town seemed to wear them. His dark hair curled along the nape of his sun-bronzed neck as if he'd delayed getting a haircut a couple of weeks too long. He was tall, easily six-three, and he wore tight-fitting blue jeans and a plaid shirt beneath a thick denim jacket.</p><p>"Mabel," the rancher said, looking past Taylor.</p><p>"This is the new schoolteacher."</p><p>"Well, for goodness'sake, miss, why didn't you come right out and say so?" Without a second's delay the clerk reached beneath the counter and brought out a tablet and started listing the items Taylor had wanted to purchase.</p><p>"Does this mean you'll accept my American Express? My Visa? My check?"</p><p>"No, I feel bad about that, but most of the commercial people in these parts don't do credit card business with those big banks. I'll just write down these items here and send you a bill at the end of the month the way I do with most folks."</p><p>"But...you don't know me." The woman hadn't so much as requested identification.</p><p>Mabel waved her hand, dismissing Taylor's concern. "I feel terrible about this."</p><p>Taylor turned her gaze to the cowboy once more. "Thank you."</p><p>He touched the brim of his hat in a quick salute and started down the aisle toward the younger girl.</p><p>While Mabel was writing up the sale, Taylor watched the exchange at the rear of the store. The teenager was standing beside a cosmetic display, gesturing wildly.</p><p>"If you could just sign here," Mabel instructed, turning the tablet around for Taylor. "I can't tell you how pleased we are that you've come to Cougar Point. There won't be much of a social life for you, but we have our moments."</p><p>"Yes, I know," Taylor murmured. She hadn't accepted this teaching assignment because of the potential nightlife. She'd specifically chosen the backwoods of Montana in an effort to give herself the necessary time to heal after her disastrous affair with Mark Brooks. She'd moved to Cougar Point so she could immerse herself in her chosen profession&#x2014;and deal with the bitterness of losing Mark. Next year she'd leave Cougar Point again, rejuvenated and whole. Her family, especially her father, had assumed she'd taken this job on impulse, and although her actions were often spontaneous, for once her father was wrong. The decision to spend a year in Montana had been well thought out, the pros and cons carefully weighed. She was taking this time to mend a badly broken heart, hoping twelve months in the country would do what six months in the city hadn't.</p><p>"I want a second opinion," the teenager cried as she rushed toward the front of the store. "Excuse me," she said brightly, holding out her hand. "I'm Mandy Palmer and this is my brother, Russ, who happens to be obstinate and stubborn and completely unreasonable and&#x2014;"</p><p>"Mandy," Russ threatened in a voice few would challenge, "I said no."</p><p>"That's just too bad," the girl returned. Tears glistened in her green eyes. She was petite and very pretty, and wore her thick blond hair in a long French braid. It swayed when she jerked her head toward her brother.</p><p>"Mandy," Russ threatened again.</p><p>The girl ignored him with a defiant tilt of her chin and looked at Taylor. "When a girl's fourteen years old and going into her first year of high school, she's old enough to wear a little makeup, isn't she?"</p><p>"Uh..." Taylor hesitated. Mandy was staring at her with imploring eyes while her brother glared heatedly, silently demanding that Taylor mind her own business. "What does your mother say?"</p><p>"Our parents are dead," Russ said gruffly. "I'm Mandy's legal guardian and I say she's too young to be painting her face with all that garbage. She's only fourteen!"</p><p>"Were you wearing makeup when you were my age?" Mandy asked Taylor, the appeal in her eyes desperate.</p><p>"A little," Taylor admitted reluctantly. She clutched her purchases tightly, not wanting to get caught in the middle of this family fight.</p><p>"Mascara?"</p><p>"Yes," Taylor confessed.</p><p>"Blush?"</p><p>Taylor nodded...</p></p><h2>Elric: Stormbringer!

Does it matter if we have free will? Does it matter if Calvinism is true? And does what you think about it matter? No and yes. No, it doesn&#39;t matter because God is who he is and does what he does regardless of what we think of him, just as the solar system keeps spinning around the sun even if we&#39;re convinced it spins around the earth. Our opinions about God will not change God, but they can change us. And so yes, it does matter because the conversations about free will and Calvinism confront us with perhaps the only question that really matters: who is God? This is a book about that question-a book about the Bible, black holes, love, sovereignty, hell, Romans 9, Jonathan Edwards, John Piper, C. S. Lewis, Karl Barth, and a little girl in a red coat. You&#39;ve heard arguments, but here&#39;s a story-Austin Fischer&#39;s story, and his journey in and out of Calvinism on a trip to the center of the universe.</p><p>Austin Fischer is Teaching Pastor at Vista Community Church. He and his wife, Allison, live in Temple, Texas. He speaks and writes and you can follow him on Twitter @austintfischer or online at purpletheology.com.'''Young, Restless, No Longer Reformed' fills a gap in contemporary literature about Calvinism. Here is a young, dynamic, evangelical pastor, well-educated theologically, who discovered the fatal flaws in Calvinism and reluctantly shook it off. This is his story, including his well-articulated reasons for that transformation. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, especially to people interested in the 'new Calvinism' and why a biblically committed young Christian might bid it adieu.''<br>--Roger E. Olson, George W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University<br><br>''By sharing his own journey in and out of Calvinism, Fischer provides readers with an honest, interesting, insightful, and very compelling critique of the self-absorbed 'black-hole God' of Calvinism. With a disarmingly laid-back style, Fischer crafts a series of clear and astute arguments that demonstrate the unbiblical and irrational nature of each of the central claims of Calvinism. Just as importantly, however, Fischer helps readers discover the humble, other-oriented, self-sacrificial God revealed in Jesus Christ . . .''<br>--Greg Boyd, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>''This book tells Austin Fischer's story, and I hope you read it, and I hope you get a bunch of friends to read it together. Talk about it and ask [the] question, . . . ''Is the Calvinist God the God we discover when we look into the face of Jesus, the incarnation of God?'' Austin tells his answers to [this question] at the age many need to begin answering [that] question.''<br>--Scot McKnight, Northern Seminary<br>''<br>With this book, Austin Fischer brings fresh insights to a very old conversation with a perspective that is at times piercing, at times deeply personal, and always thoughtful and rooted in scripture. He invites readers to wrestle along with him with some tough questions--questions that, no matter where your theological journey takes you, are worth asking with this kind of humility and care.''<br>--Rachel Held-Evans, Author of Evolving in Monkey Town --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>Big Snow</h2><p><p>While "helping" his mother with holiday housecleaning, a boy keeps a watchful eye on the progress of a winter storm.

There he served until the wars end as Hitler&#x2019;s bodyguard, courier, orderly and finally as Chief of Communications. <br><br>On the Berghoff terrace he watched Eva Braun organize parties; observed Heinrich Himmler and Albert Speer; and monitored telephone conversations from Berlin to the East Prussian Headquarters on 20 July 1944 after the attempt on Hitler's life. Towards the end Misch was drawn into the Fuhrerbunker with the last of the faithful. As defeat approached, he remained in charge of the bunker switchboard as his duty required, even after Hitler committed suicide.<br><br>Misch knew Hitler as the private man and his position was one of unconditional loyalty. His memoirs offer an intimate view of life in close attendance to Hitler and of the endless hours deep inside the bunker; and provide new insights into military events such as Hitler&#x2019;s initial feelings that the 6th Army should pull out of Stalingrad.

To add to his excitement, he receives a new horn, his first Christmas present ever. His joy is short-lived, however, when, in the middle of a snowy night, he overhears that the mare is sick: "We need Doc Baker out here tonight or we'll lose 'em both!" When the farmhand sent to get Doc plunges into a snowdrift during the raging storm, Otis, as always, comes to the rescue, setting out "with snow up to his chin." He gets lost in the woods only to discover that he is perched on the precipice of a hill. Bravely heading down a steep, slippery branch, he reaches the doctor's house, alerts him with his horn, and brings him back to save the day. The grayish-blue hues that predominate in Long's lovely, large-framed illustrations create a sense of cold stillness. Executed in gouache and pencil, they depict the red tractor in sharp contrast to countryside and woods blanketed in deep snow. There are few surprises here, and the tree branch jutting from the hill seems forced. Traveling down the branch leads Otis a bit too conveniently almost to Doc Baker's door.

Dr. Berger lives in Los Angeles, California. You can find him online at www.abphd.com.<b>Chapter 6:<br>Hidden Reward 1: Staying in Close Contact with Our Experience</b> <br> <br>We hated feeling bad. We avoided pain or discomfort. We wanted life to be easy. We&#x2019;d go to great lengths to maneuver away from any situation that might cause us anxiety or tension. Our first instinct was always to run. We were pain-phobic. We&#x2019;d do whatever was necessary to escape feeling uncomfortable. This fed our addiction like oxygen feeds a fire. <br> <br>Working Steps 8, 9, and 10 shows us that we are not as fragile as we thought. We don&#x2019;t need to run away. We are discovering that we have an innate ability to experience discomfort and grow from it. Pain is nothing more than a signal that something is wrong. If we have a broken leg and we try to walk on it, it&#x2019;s going to hurt. Our leg is saying, �Don&#x2019;t walk on me! I&#x2019;m broken. I need rest and help.&#x201d; <br>Our pain has been trying to communicate with us for a long time, but we haven&#x2019;t been listening. We didn&#x2019;t want to hear what it was saying. We blocked out the message by anesthetizing ourselves, by not listening, by playing games. We paid a huge price for our avoidance. We remained trapped in our emotionally immature behavior. We remained imprisoned in a false-self. No one could trust us, and we couldn&#x2019;t even trust ourselves. Without a willingness to experience our painful feelings, we can never grow and mature into the person we&#x2019;d like to be. We can never reach our potential. We can never grow into the person we were supposed to be. We can never become our true-self. <br> <br>To grow, we must stay in close contact with our experience, whatever it is. This is one of the things we are learning when we work Steps 8, 9, and 10. <br>Our experience holds important information for our growth and development. We need to stay in close contact with how we behaved in our relationships to make a thorough list of those we have harmed. We must face the wrongs we have done without running away from the truth. Step 8 stops us from running, and had us hold still and feel our feelings. <br> <br>If we were rigorously honest with ourselves while making the list of people we had harmed, we probably felt one or more of the following feelings: anxiety, shame, discomfort, or guilt. This is exactly what we were supposed to feel. We were learning that we don&#x2019;t have to feel comfortable to be OK. Sometimes being uncomfortable means we are OK too. In fact, another hidden reward is that we feel more comfortable the more willing we are to feel uncomfortable. Yes, another paradox! <br> <br>This process of learning form our pain also happens in Step 9. We have to stay in close contact with our experience as we humble ourselves before those we have hurt. We need to feel the pain and discomfort that comes from having violated our own moral and ethical standards. We need to stay in close contact with our experience to understand how we betrayed ourselves and others. This self-understanding is at the heart of self-forgiveness and emotional recovery. <br>Step 10 asks us to continue staying close to our experience and learning from it. We are asked to frequently engage in self-examination whenever we are upset or angry. We need to use the experience of our daily interactions and behavior in a regular practice designed to show us where we need to give ourselves credit for handling a situation well, where we still need improvement, and where we need to admit we were wrong. We need to stay close to our experience to make these spot checks and daily reviews of who we are and who we aren&#x2019;t. <br> <br>We have recovered the ability to stay in close contact with our experience and learn from it. This has restored our ability to flow with the cycle of experience. We just aren&#x2019;t getting in the way of ourselves as much as we used to, and when we do, we can become aware of how we are blocking ourselves and work through it. <br> <br>Matt attended my retreat on emotional recovery. He had over 20 years in NA and seemed to be working a solid program. Part of the retreat was spent completing the Emotional Sobriety Inventory Form provided in the appendix of my previous book, <i>12 Smart Things to do When the Booze and Drugs are Gone.</i> The first column of this form required Matt to describe a situation that upset him. Here&#x2019;s what he talked about: <br> <br>Two months ago, he and his wife, Sheila, where planning on leaving for a really cool vacation. They were going on a 30-day cruise in Europe. They were even upgraded to a first class suite that came with its own butler. Matt was excited to be treated like royalty. He and Sheila had been looking forward to this cruise for over a year. <br> <br>What attracted Matt and his wife to this particular cruise was that they would be dropped off with their road bikes and a guide in one of the ports in Spain, ride for a couple of days, and meet up with the ship in another port. Matt loved to ride, and so did his wife. He imagined how great it would be to ride through little Spanish villages, stop for lunch, and experience the beautiful country from the seat of his bike. Well, they never went on the trip. Sheila fell down a flight of stairs and broke her leg three weeks before they planned to leave. Good thing they bought vacation insurance. <br> <br>Matt was upset. He unconsciously blamed Sheila for ruining the trip. He would scold her and tell her that she should have been more careful. He&#x2019;d tell her that she ruined his summer. He made it all about him. <br> <br>Matt was terribly disappointed, but he didn&#x2019;t know how to soothe himself and lick his own wounds. Instead, he verbally lashed out at Sheila. I could see that there was a part of Matt that wasn&#x2019;t feeling good about his behavior, but he wouldn&#x2019;t admit that he was wrong. <br> <br>He justified how he was treating her because she was,after all, a bit careless. She needed to be more careful, and it was his job to straighten her out. As he discussed what happened, he made a passing comment to the group that he wasn&#x2019;t being very compassionate towards her. I interrupted him and said, �You&#x2019;re worse than that, Matt. Not only are you not being compassionate, you are also being sadistic and beating her up because you are disappointed!&#x201d; Wow, that stopped Matt in his tracks. He knew it was true. Immediately, he started feeling remorseful for his selfish and cruel behavior. He realized that she felt disappointed too, but there was no room for her feelings�it was all about Matt. <br>Here&#x2019;s a snapshot of the dialogue that happened next: <br> <br>Dr. Berger: It&#x2019;s time for you to work Step 10 with her Matt. <br>Matt: Your right, but won&#x2019;t she hate me? <br>Dr. Berger: You don&#x2019;t have to worry about that, she already thinks you&#x2019;re a jerk. <br>Matt: Thanks. (sarcastic) <br>Dr. Berger: The only thing that she doesn&#x2019;t know is that there is a part of you that knows you&#x2019;re a jerk and wants to be better than that. I&#x2019;m certain she&#x2019;d love to get to know that part of you as well. <br>Matt: (Smiling) Yes, I guess she does know that I&#x2019;m a jerk. I guess I need to make amends, don&#x2019;t I? <br>Dr. Berger: You guess? <br>Matt: OK, I need to make amends. Wow, I can really feel a resistance to the idea. There&#x2019;s a part of me that doesn&#x2019;t want to admit I&#x2019;m wrong. <br> <br>Matt stayed in close contact with his experience as we explored his resistance. He learned a lot about himself and how his selfishness hurts his relationship. He came to see how his false-self made it very hard for him to admit when he was wrong. Matt made a commitment to the group to work Step 10 when he got home. The week after the retreat was over, I got a call from Matt. He told me that he had made amends to his wife and it worked out better than he could have imagined. <br> <br>One of the many hidden rewards in working Steps 8, 9, and 10 is to stay in close contact with our experience so we can learn from it. Let&#x2019;s now unpack the second hidden reward from making amends. <br> <br> <br> <b>Chapter 7<br>Hidden Reward 2: Authenticity</b> <br> <br>Steps 8, 9, and 10 show us how much we have to gain by being authentic. These three Steps provide us with an opportunity to experience our potential self�our authentic self. We see that we are much more than the self we became to manage our anxiety and control life. This fabricated-self limited our possibilities because it prohibited us from staying in close contact with our experience. It forced us to play roles. It created a caricature of a person. We became masters at manipulation and deception. We were inhuman and cruel. <br> <br>Our false-self determined that some ways of being were OK and others not. We disowned parts of ourselves to live according to its perfectionist demands and specifications. There was no room for us to be our authentic self under the reign of this tyrant. We were exiled from our own life. Isn&#x2019;t that absurd? No wonder we had so many problems. It&#x2019;s no wonder we were lost and empty. When we denied our authentic self to meet unreal expectations, we disconnected ourselves from the best in ourselves in favor of the worst in ourselves. <br>Steps 8, 9, and 10 reunite us with our true-self. They help us put the best of us in charge. They require that we used our understanding of ourselves and our character defects to right our wrongs. By taking responsibility for the harm we have caused and sincerely making amends, we start to experience serenity and peace of mind. <br> <br>Stepping up and owning who we really are while taking responsibility for our actions continues the reconstruction of a more positive self-concept. Fritz Perls, the founder of Gestalt Therapy, stated that, �Authenticity, maturity, responsibility for one&#x2019;s actions and life, response-ability, and living in the now, having the creativeness of the now available, is all one thing.&#x201d; Authenticity is central to our growth and development. It is essential to our recovery. It is imperative to our maturity. <br> <br>We must have a persistent effort to reveal ourselves as we are in this moment, witho...</p><h2>What to Say Next</h2><p><b><b>"<i>What to Say Next </i>reminds readers that hope can be found in unexpected places."&nbsp;<b>&#x2013;Bustle<br></b></b><br>From the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Tell Me Three Things</i> comes a story about two struggling teenagers who find an unexpected connection just when they need it most.

I always sit alone, and when I say always, I don&#x2019;t mean that in the exaggerated vernacular favored by my classmates. In the 622 days I&#x2019;ve attended this high school, not a single person has ever sat beside me at lunch, which is what justifies my calling her sitting there--so close that her elbow almost grazes mine--an &#x201c;event.&#x201d; My first instinct is to reach for my notebook and look up her entry. Under K for Kit, not under L for Lowell, because though I&#x2019;m good with facts and scholarly pursuits, I&#x2019;m terrible with names. Partly this is because names are random words completely devoid of context, and partly this is because I believe names rarely fit the people they belong to, which, if you think about it, makes perfect sense. Parents name their child at a time when they have the absolute least amount of information they will ever have about the person they are naming. The whole practice is illogical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take Kit, for example, which is not actually her name, her name is Katherine, but I have never heard anyone call her Katherine, even in elementary school. Kit doesn&#x2019;t in any way look like a Kit, which is a name for someone who is boxy and stiff and easily understandable with step-by-step instructions. Instead the name of the girl sitting next to me should have a Z in it, because she&#x2019;s confusing and zigzagged and pops up in surprising places--like at my lunch table--and maybe the number eight, because she&#x2019;s hourglass-shaped, and the letter S too, because it&#x2019;s my favorite. I like Kit because she&#x2019;s never been mean to me, which is not something I can say about the vast majority of my classmates. It&#x2019;s a shame her parents got her name all wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m a David, which also doesn&#x2019;t work, because there are lots of Davids in the world--at last check 3,786,417 of them in the United States alone--and so by virtue of my first name, one would assume I&#x2019;d be like lots of other people. Or, at the very least, relatively neurotypical, which is a scientific, less offensive way of saying normal. That hasn&#x2019;t been the case. At school, no one calls me anything, except the occasional homo or moron, neither of which is in any way accurate--my IQ is 168 and I&#x2019;m attracted to girls, not boys. Also, homo is a pejorative term for a gay person, and even if my classmates are mistaken about my sexual orientation, they should know better than to use that word. At home my mom calls me son--which I have no problem with because it&#x2019;s true--my dad calls me David, which feels like an itchy sweater with a too-tight neck, and my sister calls me Little D, which for some inexplicable reason fits just right, even though I&#x2019;m not even a little bit little. I&#x2019;m six foot two and 165 pounds. My sister is five foot three and 105 pounds. I should call her Little L, for Little Lauren, but I don&#x2019;t. I call her Miney, which is what I&#x2019;ve been calling her since I was a baby, because she&#x2019;s always felt like the only thing in a confusing world that belongs to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miney is away at college, and I miss her. She&#x2019;s my best friend--technically speaking, my only friend--but I feel like even if I had friends, she&#x2019;d still be my best one. So far she&#x2019;s the only person I&#x2019;ve ever known who has helped make being me a little less hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By now you&#x2019;ve probably realized I&#x2019;m different. It usually doesn&#x2019;t take people very long to figure that out. One doctor thought I might have a &#x201c;borderline case of Asperger&#x2019;s,&#x201d; which is stupid, because you can&#x2019;t have a borderline case of Asperger&#x2019;s. Actually, you can&#x2019;t really have Asperger&#x2019;s at all anymore, because it was written out of the DSM-5 (the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) in 2013, and instead people with that group of characteristics are considered to have high-functioning autism (or HFA), which is also misleading. The autism spectrum is multidimensional, not linear. The doctor was obviously an idiot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Out of curiosity, I&#x2019;ve done my own reading in this area (I bought a used DSM-4 on eBay; the 5 was too pricey), and though I lack the necessary medical training required to make a full diagnostic assessment, I don&#x2019;t believe the label applies to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, I can get myself into trouble in social situations; I like order and routine; when I&#x2019;m interested in something, I can be hyperfocused to the exclusion of other activities; and, fine, I am clumsy. But when I have to, I can make eye contact. I don&#x2019;t flinch if you touch me. I tend to recognize most idioms, though I keep a running list in my notebook just in case. I like to think I&#x2019;m empathetic, but I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure it really matters if I have Asperger&#x2019;s, anyway, especially because it no longer exists. It&#x2019;s just another label. Take the word jock. If enough psychiatrists wanted to, they could add that to the DSM and diagnose all the guys on the Mapleview football team. Characteristics would include at least two of the following: (1) athleticism, especially while wearing spandex, (2) unnatural ease with the concept of strapping a hard cup around your penis, (3) being an asshole. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether you call me an Aspie or a weirdo or even a moron. The fact remains that I very much wish I were more like everyone else. Not the jocks, necessarily. I don&#x2019;t want to be the kind of guy who gives kids like me a hard time. But if I got the chance to make some sort of cosmic upgrade--switch David 1.0 to a 2.0 version who understood what to say in day-to-day conversation--I&#x2019;d do it in an instant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe when parents name their children they do it from the perspective of wishful thinking. Like when you go to a restaurant and ask for a rare steak, and even though there is no universally agreed definition of the word rare, you hope you get exactly what you want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My mom and dad ordered a David. They got me instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my notebook:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>KIT LOWELL: Height: 5' 4". Weight: Approximately 125 lbs. Wavy brown hair, pulled into a ponytail on test days, rainy days, and most Mondays. Skin is brownish, because her dad--a dentist--is white and her mom is Indian (Southeast Asian, not Native American). Class ranking: 14. Activities: school newspaper, Spanish Club, Pep Club.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notable Encounters</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Third grade: Stopped Justin Cho from giving me a wedgie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth grade: Made me a valentine. (Note: KL made all the boys valentines, not just me. But still. It was nice. Except for the glitter. Because glitter is uncontainable and has sticky properties, and I generally don&#x2019;t like uncontainable and sticky things.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Eighth grade: After math class, she asked what I got on my math test. I said: 100. She said: Wow, you must have studied hard. I said: No, quadratic equations are easy. She said: Um, okay. (Later, when I reenacted the conversation for Miney, she told me that I should have said that I had studied, even if that meant lying. I&#x2019;m not a very good liar.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Tenth grade: Kit smiled at me when only our two names were announced as National Merit semifinalists on the loudspeaker. I was going to say &#x201c;Congratulations,&#x201d; but Justin Cho said &#x201c;Damn, girl!&#x201d; first and gave Kit a hug. And then she wasn&#x2019;t looking at me anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Important Characteristics</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. On cold days, she stretches her sleeves to cover her whole hands instead of wearing gloves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Her hair isn&#x2019;t curly, but it isn&#x2019;t straight either. It hangs in repetitive, alternating commas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. She&#x2019;s the prettiest girl in school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. She sits crisscross-applesauce on almost all chairs, even narrow ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. She has a faint scar next to her left eyebrow that looks almost like a Z. I once asked Miney if she thought I&#x2019;d ever be able to touch that scar, because I&#x2019;m curious what it feels like, and Miney said, &#x201c;Sorry, Little D. But as the Magic 8 Ball says: My Sources Say No.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. She drives a red Toyota Corolla, license plate XHD893.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Friends</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost everyone, but mostly hangs out with Annie, Violet, and sometimes Dylan (the Girl Dylan, not the Boy Dylan). Common characteristics of friend group, with the exception of Kit, include flat-ironed hair, minor acne, and larger than average breasts. For five school days last year, Kit walked the halls holding hands with Gabriel, only occasionally stopping to make out, but now they don&#x2019;t do that anymore. I don&#x2019;t like Gabriel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional Notes: Nice. Miney puts her on the Trust List. I second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course I don&#x2019;t open the notebook in front of her. Even I know better than that. But I do touch its spine, because having it nearby makes me feel less anxious. The notebook was Miney&#x2019;s idea. Back in middle school, after the Locker Room Incident, which is irrelevant to this discussion, Miney decided I was too trusting. Apparently, unlike me, when most people talk they aren&#x2019;t necessarily telling the truth. See for example the Test Lie suggested above. Why lie about whether I studied for a test? Ridiculous. Quadratic equations are easy. That&#x2019;s just a fact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So your dad is dead,&#x201d; I say, because it&#x2019;s the first thing that pops into my head when she sits down. This is new information that I have not yet added to her notebook entry, only because I just found out. I&#x2019;m usually the last to know things about my classmates, if I ever learn about them at all. But Annie and Violet were talking about Kit at Violet&#x2019;s locker this morning, which happens to be above mine. According to Annie, &#x201c;Kit&#x2019;s been, like, a total mess since the whole thing with her dad, and I know it&#x2019;s been hard and whatever, but she&#x2019;s kind of being, I don&#x2019;t know, mean.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t usually listen to the other kids at school--most of what they have to say is boring and feels like bad background music, something clanky and harsh, heavy metal, maybe--but for some reason this seeped through. Then they started talking about the funeral, how it was weird that they cried more than Kit, that it&#x2019;s not healthy for her to keep things bottled up inside, which is a ridiculous thing to say because feelings don&#x2019;t have mass, and also they are not doctors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would have liked to go to Kit&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s funeral, if only because he was also on my Nice List, and I assume when someone on your Nice List dies, you should go to their funeral. Kit&#x2019;s dad, Dr. Lowell is--was--my dentist, and he never complained about my noise-canceling headphones getting in the way of his drill. He always gave me a red lollipop after a cleaning, which seems counterintuitive and yet was always appreciated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I look at Kit. She doesn&#x2019;t look messy--in fact, she seems better groomed than usual and is wearing a man&#x2019;s white button-down shirt that looks recently ironed. Her cheeks are pink, and her eyes are a little wet, and I turn away because she is breathtakingly beautiful and therefore very hard to look at.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish someone had told me, because I would have gone to his funeral. He used to give me lollipops,&#x201d; I say. Kit stares straight ahead, doesn&#x2019;t respond. I take this to mean I should keep talking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in heaven. I&#x2019;m with Richard Dawkins on that one. I think it&#x2019;s something people tell themselves to make the finality of death less scary. At the very least, it seems highly unlikely to me in the angels-and-white-cloud iteration you hear about. Do you believe in heaven?&#x201d; I ask. Kit takes a bite of her sandwich, still doesn&#x2019;t turn her head. &#x201c;I doubt it, because you are a highly intelligent person.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No offense or anything, but would you mind if we didn&#x2019;t talk?&#x201d; she asks. I&#x2019;m pretty sure this is not a question she wants me to answer, but I do anyway. Miney has put the expression no offense on the Be Wary List. Apparently bad things usually follow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer it, actually. But I&#x2019;d like to say just one last thing: Your dad shouldn&#x2019;t have died. That&#x2019;s really unfair.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kit nods, and the commas of her hair shake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; she says. And then we eat the rest of our sandwiches--mine peanut butter and jelly since it&#x2019;s Monday--in silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But good silence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kit</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t really know why I decide not to sit with Annie and Violet at lunch. I can feel their eyes on me when I pass right by our usual table, which is at the front of the caf, the perfect table because you can see everyone from there. I always sit with them. Always. We are best friends--a three-person squad since middle school--and so I realize I&#x2019;m making some sort of grand statement by not even waving hello. I just knew as soon as I came in and saw them huddled together talking and laughing and just being so normal, like nothing had changed at all--and yes, I realize that nothing has changed for them, that their families are no more or less screwed up than they were before my life imploded--that I couldn&#x2019;t do it. Couldn&#x2019;t sit down, take out my turkey sandwich, and act like I was the same old reliable Kit. The one who would make a self-deprecating joke about my shirt, which I&#x2019;m wearing in some weird tribute to my dad, a silly attempt to feel closer to him even though it makes me feel like even more of an outcast and more confused about the whole thing than I was before I put it on. Just the kind of reminder I don&#x2019;t need. Like I could actually forget, for even a single minute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel stupid. Could that be what grief does to you? It&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m walking around school with an astronaut&#x2019;s helmet on my head. A dome of dullness as impenetrable as glass. No one here understands what I&#x2019;m going through. How could they? I don&#x2019;t even understand it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed safer somehow to sit over here, in the back, away from my friends, who have clearly already moved on to other important things, like whether Violet&#x2019;s thighs look fat in her new high-waisted jeans, and away from all the other people who have stopped me in the hall over the past couple of weeks with that faux-concerned look on their faces and said: &#x201c;Kit, I&#x2019;m like so, so, so sorry about your daaaad.&#x201d; Everyone seems to draw out the word dad like they are scared to get beyond that one sentence, to experience the conversational free fall of what to say next that inevitably follows. My mom claims that it&#x2019;s not our job to make other people feel comfortable--this is about us, not them, she told me just before the funeral--but her way, which is to weep and to throw her arms around sympathetic strangers, is not mine. I have not yet figured out my way.</p></p><h2>Calligraphy: A Book of Contemporary Inspiration</h2><p><p><strong>An invaluable sourcebook for both enthusiastic beginners and experienced calligraphers who wish to let their imaginations run free</strong></p><p>The creative design potential of calligraphy is almost limitless: it can be a very personal pathway to explore an enormous array of sophisticated visual concepts. In this striking and original book, renowned calligrapher Denise Lach transforms images from nature into a rich source of inspiration for calligraphic compositions.</p><p>This is not a technical how-to guide, but an incitement to reinterpret our surroundings in infinitely varied lettering. Lach invites us to look closely at details and textures, expanding our powers of observation and finding ideas in the world around us. Using a range of writing tools and techniques, she takes a playful approach to written script, encouraging readers to look beyond legibility and use letterforms as building blocks to create beautiful calligraphic images.</p> 259 illustrations, 100 in color</p><p><strong>Denise Lach</strong> has been involved with calligraphy and conceptual writing since early 1985. She teaches lettering design and screenprinting at the Basel School of Design, and leads calligraphy courses and workshops in Switzerland and abroad.

Only the seven plays in this volume have survived intact. From the complex drama of Antigone, the heroine willing to sacrifice life and love for a principle, to the mythic doom embodied by Oedipus, the uncommonly good man brought down by the gods, Sophocles possessed a tragic vision that, in Matthew Arnold&#x2019;s phrase, &#x201c;saw life steadily and saw it whole.&#x201d;<br><br>This one-volume paperback edition of Sophocles&#x2019; complete works is a revised and modernized version of the famous Jebb translation, which has been called &#x201c;the most carefully wrought prose version of Sophocles in English.&#x201d;*<br>*Moses Hadas</p><p>Sophocles, the Greek tragic dramatist, was born at Colonus near Athens about 496 B.C. Although hopelessness and misfortune plague the characters in his great plays, Sophocles&#39;s own life was a long, prosperous one. He was from a good family, well educated, handsome, wealthy, healthy, and highly respected by his fellow Athenians. His first dramatic production, in 468, won the prize over Aeschylus&#39;s. He wrote two dozen more plays before 450, by which date he had made important changes in the form of tragedy by adding a third speaking actor to the traditional two, by reducing the importance of the chorus, and by improving the stage scenery. Sophocles wrote over 120 plays; seven complete plays survive (plus half a light satyr play, some fragments, and ninety titles). Aristotle, in his Poetics, praised Sophocles above other tragedians and regarded his masterpiece, OEDIPUS THE KING, as a model for Greek tragedy. Sophocles&#39;s plays won more victories than the plays of either his older contemporary Aeschylus or the younger Euripides. The circumstances of his life, as well as his plays, suggest that Sophocles was conservative, and opposed to innovation in religion and politics. At eighty-three he was still active in the Athenian government. He died in 406 B.C. in Athens at the age of ninety.AJAX<br><br>The character of Ajax, as fixed in the Iliad and therefore familiar to the audience, was of an extraordinarily powerful man, next to Achilles the best of the Greek warriors at Troy, but also of a man extraordinarily headstrong and self-centered. After Achilles&#x2019; death, according to legend, the divine armor made for him by Hephaestus was to be given to the worthiest of his survivors, and Ajax naturally expected the prize. Instead the chieftains voted to award it to Odysseus. Ajax&#x2019; consequent hatred of Odysseus is mentioned in the Odyssey: when the two meet in Hades, Ajax refuses to speak to Odysseus but turns his back on him.<br><br>The opening of the play informs us that in chagrin at his disappointment Ajax was on the point of murdering the Greek generals; to save them Athena darkened Ajax&#x2019; senses so that he mistook the army&#x2019;s livestock for the generals and slaughtered them instead. When Ajax recovers and realizes, not that his intention was wrong, but that its miscarriage would make him ridiculous, he determines on suicide. He ignores the pleas of Tecmessa and the chorus, bids his child farewell, and departs. <br><br>Soon he returns, ostensibly reconciled to life; he says he will go and bury his unlucky sword by the seaside and then have peace forevermore. After Ajax has gone and the chorus has sung its premature joy, a messenger from Teucer brings Calchas&#x2019; warning that Ajax must be kept indoors that day. The chorus and Tecmessa leave to find him. The scene changes to seaside sedge (the only change of scene in the extant plays of Sophocles) and there Ajax makes a farewell speech, with a curse for the Atreidae, buries his sword point up, and falls upon it. The searchers enter and the body of Ajax is found, fittingly by Tecmessa. Teucer comes to bury the body but is forbidden to do so, first by Menelaus, whom he outfaces, and then by Agamemnon, who presents a reasonable argument for denying burial. Odysseus, despite Ajax&#x2019; animosity toward him, persuades Agamemnon to allow the burial.<br><br>Modern readers sometimes find the dispute about the burial anticlimactic and irrelevant; but the last third of the Ajax is not a Hamlet without Hamlet. It is not an episode in Ajax&#x2019; life which is the theme but the totality of his career. To assess his career justly the arguments for and against burial are relevant, and the final decision puts the seal on Ajax&#x2019; claim to heroization.<br>PERSONS<br><br>Athena<br>Odysseus<br>Ajax<br>Chorus of Salaminian Sailors<br>Eurysaces, Attendants, Heralds (mute characters)<br>Tecmessa<br>Teucer<br>Menelaus<br>Agamemnon<br><br>SCENE: Before the tent of Ajax at Troy.<br><br>(Odysseus is seen scanning footprints, athena aloft.)<br><br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Always I have seen you, son of Laertes, seeking to snatch some occasion against your enemies; and now at the tent of Ajax by the ships, where he is posted at the very edge of the camp, I see you pausing long on his trail and scanning his fresh tracks, to find whether he is within or abroad. Your course keen-scenting as a Laconian hound&#x2019;s leads you well to your goal. Even now the man is gone within, sweat streaming from his face and from hands that have slain with the sword. There is no further need for you to peer within these doors. But what is your aim in this eager quest? Speak, so that you may learn from her who can give you light.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Voice of Athena, dearest to me of the Immortals, how clearly, though you are unseen, do I hear your call and seize it in my soul, as when a Tyrrhenian clarion speaks from mouth of bronze! You have rightly discerned that I am hunting to and fro on the trail of a foeman, Ajax of the mighty shield. It is he and no other that I have been tracking so long.<br>This night he has done to us a thing unthinkable&#x2014;if he is indeed the doer. We know nothing certain but drift in doubt, and I took upon me the burden of this search. We have lately found the cattle, our spoil, dead, slaughtered by human hand, and dead beside them the guardians of the flock.<br>All men lay this crime to him. A scout who had descried him bounding alone over the plain with reeking sword brought me tidings and declared the matter. Then straightway I rushed upon his track; sometimes I recognize the footprints as his, but sometimes I am bewildered and cannot read whose they are. Your help is timely; yours is the hand that always guides my course, as in the past so for the days to come.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;I know it, Odysseus, and came early on the path, a watcher friendly to your chase.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Dear mistress, is my toil to some purpose?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Know that yonder man is the doer of these deeds.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Why was his insensate hand so fierce?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;In bitter wrath touching the arms of Achilles.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Why then this furious onslaught upon the flocks?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;It was in your blood, as he thought, that he was dyeing his hand.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;What? Was this design aimed against the Greeks?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;He would have accomplished it too if I had been careless.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;How had he laid these bold plans? What could inspire such hardihood?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;He went forth against you in the night, by stealth and alone.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp; And did he come near us? Did he reach his goal?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;He was already at the doors of the two chiefs.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;What cause stayed his eager hand from murder?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;I, even I, withheld him, for I cast upon his eyes the tyrannous fancies of his baneful joy. I turned his fury aside on the flocks of sheep and the confused droves guarded by herdsmen, the spoil which you had not yet divided. He fell upon the horned throng dealing death and hewing them to the earth around him. Now he thought that the two Atreidae were the prisoners whom he slew with his hand, now it was this chief and now that, at each new onset. And while the man raved in the throes of frenzy I still urged him and hurled him into the toils of doom. Presently, when he rested from this work, he bound together the living oxen and the sheep and brought them home, as though his captives were men and not good cattle. And now he is tormenting them, bound together, in the house.<br>But I will show you this madness openly, so that when you have seen it you may proclaim it to all the Greeks. Be steadfast and of good courage, nor look for evil from the man, for I will turn the vision of his eyes away and keep them from seeing your face.<br>Ho, you who are binding the back-bent arms of your captives with cords, you I call; come here! Ajax, what ho! come forth from the house!<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp; What are you doing, Athena? Never call him out.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Hold your peace! Do not earn the name of coward!<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Forbear, I pray you; be content that he stay inside.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;What is the danger? Was he not a man before?<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Yes, an enemy to your servant, and still is.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;And to mock at enemies&#x2014;is that not the sweetest mockery?<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Enough for me that he remain within his doors.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;You are afraid of seeing a madman in full view?<br>ODYSSEUS&nbsp;No fear could make me shun him if he were sane.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;But even now he shall not see you, though you are near.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;How so, if he still sees with the same eyes?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;I will darken them though they are open.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;Well, all is possible when a god contrives.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Stand silent, then, and stay where you are.<br>ODYSSEUS.&nbsp;I must stay. I wish that I were far from here!<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;What ho, Ajax, once again I call you! Is this your scanty regard for your ally?<br><br>AJAX&nbsp;(enters, holding a bloodstained scourge). Hail, Athena! Hail, Zeus-born maid! How well you have stood by me! Yes, I will crown your shrine with trophies of pure gold for this prize!<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Fairly spoken. But tell me this&#x2014;have you dyed your sword well in the Greek camp?<br>AJAX.&nbsp;That is my boast; I do not disclaim it.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;And perhaps turned your armed hand on the Atreidae?<br>AJAX.&nbsp;So that they will never again dishonor Ajax.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;The men are dead, as I take your meaning?<br>AJAX.&nbsp;Dead. Now let them rob me of my arms!<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Good. And then the son of Laertes&#x2014;in what plight have you left him? Has he escaped you?<br>AJAX.&nbsp;What, you ask me about that accursed fox?<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Yes, about Odysseus, your adversary.<br>AJAX.&nbsp;No guest so welcome, lady. He is sitting in the house&#x2014;in bonds. I do not mean him to die just yet.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;What would you do first? What larger advantage would you win?<br>AJAX.&nbsp;First he shall be bound to a pillar beneath my roof&#x2014;<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;The unlucky man; what will you do to him?<br>AJAX.&nbsp;&#x2014;and have his back crimsoned with the scourge before he dies.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Do not torture the wretch so cruelly.<br>AJAX.&nbsp;In all else, Athena, have your will, I say; but his doom shall be no other than this.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Since it pleases you to do this, then, do not hold your hand, do not abate one jot of your intention.<br>AJAX.&nbsp;I go to my work. Always stand at my side, I charge you, as you have stood today! (Exit.)<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Do you see, Odysseus, how great is the strength of the gods? Whom could you have found more prudent than this man or more valiant for the service of the time?<br>ODYSSEUS&nbsp;I know none. I pity him in his misery for all that he is my foe, because he is bound fast to a dread doom. I think of my own lot no less than his. For I see that we are but phantoms, all we who live, or fleeting shadows.<br>ATHENA.&nbsp;Marking such things, therefore, see that your own lips never speak a haughty word against the gods, and assume no proud posture if you prevail above another in prowess or by store of ample wealth. For a day can humble all human things and a day can lift them up, but the wise of heart are loved of the gods, and the evil are abhorred.<br><br>CHORUS&nbsp;(enters). Son of Telamon, you whose wave-girt Salamis is firmly throned upon the sea, when your fortunes are fair I rejoice, but when the stroke of Zeus comes upon you, or the angry rumor of the Danai with noise of evil tongues, then I tremble and am in great fear, like a winged dove with troubled eye.<br>And so, telling of the night now spent, loud murmurs beset us for our shame; telling how you visited the meadow wild with steeds and destroyed the cattle of the Greeks, their spoil, prizes of the spear which had not yet been shared, slaying them with flashing sword.<br>Such are the whispered slanders that Odysseus breathes into all ears, and he wins large belief. For now the tale that he tells of you is specious; and each hearer rejoices more than he who told, despitefully exulting in your woes.<br>Yes, point your arrow at a noble spirit and you shall not miss; but should a man speak such things against me he would win no faith. &#x2019;Tis on the powerful that envy creeps. Yet the small without the great can ill be trusted to guard the walls; lowly leagued with great will prosper best, great served by less.<br>But foolish men cannot be led to learn these truths. Even such are the men who rail against you, and we are helpless to repel these charges without you, O King. Verily, when they have escaped your eye they chatter like flocking birds; but terrified by the mighty vulture, suddenly, if you should perchance appear, they will cower still and dumb.<br>Was it the Tauric Artemis, child of Zeus, that drove you&#x2014;O dread rumor, parent of my shame!&#x2014;against the herds of all our host, in revenge, I suppose, for a victory that had paid no tribute, whether it was that she had been disappointed of glorious spoil, or because a stag had been slain without a thank-offering? Or can it have been the mail-clad Lord of War that was wroth for dishonor to his aiding spear and took vengeance by nightly wiles?<br>Never of your own heart, son of Telamon, would you have gone so far astray as to fall upon the flocks. Verily, when the gods send madness it must come; but may Zeus and Phoebus avert the evil rumor of the Greeks!<br>And if the great chiefs charge you falsely in the rumors which they spread, or sons of the wicked line of Sisyphus, forbear, O my king, forbear to win me an evil name by still keeping your face thus hidden in the tent by the sea.<br>Nay, up from your seat, wheresoever you are brooding in this pause of many days from battle, making the flame of mischief blaze up to heaven! But the insolence of your foes goes abroad without fear in the breezy glens, while all men mock with taunts most grievous; and my sorrow passes not away.<br><br>TECMESSA&nbsp;(enters). Mariners of Ajax, of the race that springs from the Erechtheidae, sons of the soil&#x2014;mourning is the portion of us who care for the house of Telamon far away. Ajax, our dread lord of rugged might, now lies stricken with a storm that darkens the soul.<br>CHORUS.&nbsp;What is the heavy change from yesterday&#x2019;s fortune which this night has produced? Daughter of the Phrygian Teleutas, speak; for to you, his spear-won bride, bold Ajax has borne a constant love. You may therefore hint the answer with knowledge.<br>TECMESSA.&nbsp;Oh, how shall I tell a tale too dire for words? Terrible as death is the fate which you must hear. Seized with madness in the night, our glorious Ajax has been utterly undone. For evidence you may see within his dwelling the butchered victims weltering in their blood, sacrifices of no hand but his.<br>CHORUS.&nbsp;What tidings of the fiery warrior have you told, not to be borne nor yet escaped, tidings which the mighty Danai noise abroad, which their strong rumor spreads! Woe is me, I dread the doom to come. Shamed before all eyes, the man will die, if his frenzied hand has slain with dark sword the herds and the horse-guiding herdsmen.<br>TECMESSA.&nbsp;Alas! It was from those pastures that he came to me with his captive flock! Of part he cut the throats on the floor within; some he rent asunder, hewing their sides. Then he caught up two white-footed rams. Of one he sheared off the head and the tongue-tip and flung them away; the other he bound upright to a pillar, and seized a heavy thong of harness, and flogged with shrill, doubled lash, while he uttered revilings which a god, and no mortal had taught.<br>chorus.&nbsp;The time has come for each of us to veil his head and betake him to stealthy speed of foot, or to sit on the bench at the quick oar and give her way to the seafaring ship.</p><h2>Here Comes Teacher Cat</h2><p><b>It&#x2019;s back to school for the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Cat when he steps in as a substitute teacher.&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Cat is <i>not</i> pleased to be tapped as substitute teacher.

Clive James rescues, or occasionally destroys, the careers of many of the greatest thinkers, humanists, musicians, artists, and philosophers of the twentieth century.

British critic James (<i>Visions Before Midnight</i>) structures each entry as a brief life sketch followed by quotations that spark an appreciation, a condemnation or a tangent (a piece on filmmaker Terry Gilliam veers into a discussion of torturers' pleasure in their work). Sometimes, as in his salute to Tony Curtis's acting or his savage assault on bebop legend John Coltrane's penchant for "subjecting some helpless standard to ritual murder," James's purpose is just bravura opinionating. But most articles are linked by a defense of liberal humanism against totalitarianisms of the left and right&#x2014;and ideologues who champion them. He lionizes prewar Vienna's martyred Jewish cafe intellectuals; castigates French apologists for communism&#x2014;especially Sartre, who "could sound as if he was talking about everything while saying nothing"; and chides Borges for not noticing Argentina's descent into fascism. This theme can grow intrusive; even in an entry on children's author Beatrix Potter, he feels called upon to denounce Soviet children's books. But James's brilliantly aphoristic prose, full of aesthetic insights but careful not to let aesthetics obscure morality, makes for a delightful browse suffused with a potent message.

Dallas Younger, a star athlete in high school, now drifts from tavern to poker game, losing money, and, inevitably, another set of false teeth. His ex-wife, Anne, is stuck in a losing battle with her mother over the care of her sick father. And their son, Randall, is deliberately neglecting his school work--because in a place like Mohawk it doesn't pay to be too smart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <b>Mohawk</b>, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Richard Russo, explores these lives with profound compassion and flint-hard wit. Out of derailed ambitions and old loves, secret hatreds and communal myths, he has created a richly plotted, densely populated, and wonderfully written novel that captures every nuance of America's backyard.</p></p><p>The town of Mohawk may be provincial but it&#39;s far from sleepy. Its inhabitants seem perpetually awake, and not only on Saturday at two in the morning, &#34;when the bars are closing and people are forced to consider the prospect of returning home with so many of the night&#39;s dreams unfulfilled.&#34; Richard Russo focuses on several characters who are leading lives of extreme--and extremely funny--longing. Dallas Younger, for instance, hit his peak playing high-school football, and it&#39;s been downhill from there. He has no idea what women, particularly his ex-wife, are thinking, which makes him really glad there are none in on the local poker game. And he&#39;s still at a loss to figure out why he has no relationship with his son (probably something to do with the fact that he never sees him). Even the calendar at the local grill is for 1966, since the owner figures &#34;the months are the same&#34; and being a few days out of whack doesn&#39;t matter. This same man has a private betting system. Choosing among the top jockeys isn&#39;t that hard--he tries to assess their current levels of pride, concentration, and desire. Richard Russo shows us that these same qualities exist in his hard-luck characters.Originally published in 1986 in the Vintage Contemporaries paperback series--and reissued now in hardcover alongside his masterful new novel, "Empire Falls--Richard Russo's "Mohawk remains today as it was described then: A first novel with all the assurance of a mature writer at the peak of form and ambition, "Mohawk is set in upstate New York and chronicles over a dozen lives in a leather town, long after the tanneries have started closing down. Ranging over three generations--and clustered mainly in two clans, the Grouses and the Gaffneys--these remarkably various lives share only the common human dilemmas and the awesome physical and emotional presence of Mohawk itself. <br>For this is a town like Winesburg, Ohio or "Our Town, in our time, that encompasses a plethora of characters, events and mysteries. At once honestly tragic and sharply, genuinely funny, Mohawk captures life, then affirms it. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Eloise Dresses Up</h2><p>There's nothing Eloise<br> loves to do more than dress up!<br> And with so many choices, she will<br> need more than Weenie and Nanny's<br> help to pick the perfect outfit. <br> Use and reuse the stickers to help<br> Eloise dress up in her favorite<br> costumes and have a fabulous<br> adventure.</p><p>Kay Thompson (1909&#x2013;1998) was a singer, dancer, vocal arranger, and coach of many MGM musicals in the 1940s. The Eloise character grew out of the voice of a precocious six-year-old that Miss Thompson put on to amuse her friends. Collaborating with Hilary Knight on what was an immediate bestseller, Kay Thompson became a literary sensation when <i>Eloise</i> was published in 1955. The book has sold more than two million copies to date.

It elucidates how social insensitivities and imposed silences prevent members of different groups from interacting epistemically in fruitful ways--from listening to each other, learning from each other, and mutually enriching each other's perspectives. Medina's epistemology of resistance offers a contextualist theory of our complicity with epistemic injustices and a social connection model of shared responsibility for improving epistemic conditions of participation in social practices. Through the articulation of a new interactionism and polyphonic contextualism, the book develops a sustained argument about the role of the imagination in mediating social perceptions and interactions. It concludes that only through the cultivation of practices of resistance can we develop a social imagination that can help us become sensitive to the suffering of excluded and stigmatized subjects. Drawing on Feminist Standpoint Theory and Critical Race Theory, this book makes contributions to social epistemology and to recent discussions of testimonial and hermeneutical injustice, epistemic responsibility, counter-performativity, and solidarity in the fight against racism and sexism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jos Medina</strong> is Walter Dill Scott Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University. He works primarily in Gender &amp; Race Theory, Philosophy of Language, and Social Epistemology. His writings on language and identity have focused on gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity. Medina's books include <em>Speaking from Elsewhere</em> (SUNY Press, 2006) and <em>Language</em> (Continuum, 2005).<br><br>"Jos Medina has written an original book which masterfully combines continental <br>and American traditions and which addresses important topics in contemporary social <br>and political philosophy, showing why we should pay more attention to the epistemic <br>dimension of our everyday interactions."--Roberto Frega, <em>European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy</em><p></p><br>"This book breaks new ground in linking epistemology with social and political concerns, still a relatively new area of interface in philosophy. Most of the serious epistemology that has done this linking to date is in feminist epistemology, which Medina draws on as a resource. He then goes on to develop a highly general, inclusive, and broad account that addresses oppression in its most general terms. Going beyond critique he develops a positive reconstruction that usefully addresses both the social and the individual changes that need to be made in knowing practices, and provides a new and very helpful vocabulary for describing and understanding the patterns of epistemic injustice. This is one of the most important works of epistemology and radical social theory in a long time."--Linda Alcoff, Professor of Philosophy, Hunter College and CUNY Graduate Center<p></p><br>"The social epistemology developed in recent decades represents a welcome advance on the dead-end of Cartesian individualism. But the social has too often been conceived of without centering social <em>oppression</em>, and all the noetic complexities that come with it. In this richly detailed and wide-ranging text, Jos Medina locates the epistemological project squarely where it belongs: in societies of privilege, subordination, and radical group differentiation. Drawing on feminism, critical race theory, and queer theory, he shows with unprecedented thoroughness that we need to develop the cognitive virtues necessary to overcome active ignorance, epistemic injustice, and structural group insensitivity--in sum, the problems not of a conveniently sanitized epistemic 'Twin-Earth' but the disordered world in which we all actually live."--Charles Mills, John Evans Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy.

This welcoming spirit has found appeal around the world, but at the heart of the field is an identity crisis. Nearly every effort to articulate an American Studies methodology has been rejected for fear of losing intellectual flexibility and freedom. But what if these fears are misplaced? Providing a fresh look at American Studies in practice, this book contends that a shared set of &#x201c;rules&#x201d; can offer a springboard to creativity. <i>American Studies: A User&#x2019;s Guide </i>offers readers a critical introduction to the history and methods of the field as well as useful strategies for interpretation, curation, analysis, and theory.</p><p>"This book fills a long-felt need for a single work that can be used as a touchstone and launching pad for students of American studies at all levels.

It examines the methods of current forensic DNA typing, focusing on short tandem repeats (STRs). It encompasses current forensic DNA analysis methods, as well as biology, technology and genetic interpretation. <br>This book reviews the methods of forensic DNA testing used in the first two decades since early 1980&#x2019;s, and it offers perspectives on future trends in this field, including new genetic markers and new technologies. Furthermore, it explains the process of DNA testing from collection of samples through DNA extraction, DNA quantitation, DNA amplification, and statistical interpretation. The book also discusses DNA databases, which play an important role in law enforcement investigations. In addition, there is a discussion about ethical concerns in retaining DNA profiles and the issues involved when people use a database to search for close relatives. <br>Students of forensic DNA analysis, forensic scientists, and members of the law enforcement and legal professions who want to know more about STR typing will find this book invaluable.<ul><li>Includes a glossary with over 400 terms for quick reference of unfamiliar terms as well as an acronym guide to decipher the DNA dialect</li><li>Continues in the style of Forensic DNA Typing, 2e, with high-profile cases addressed in D.N.A.Boxes-- "Data, Notes &amp; Applications" sections throughout</li><li>Ancillaries include: instructor manual Web site, with tailored set of 1000+ PowerPoint slides (including figures), links to online training websites and a test bank with key</li></ul></p><p><p><b>Fundamentals of Forensic DNA Typing </b>&#x2013; <b>John M.

That is, both animals can and do derive valuable nutrition from the voluntary consumption of meat. In this regard, many mammals, including people, pigs, bears, raccoons, and myriad others have seemingly similar carnivorous tendencies. When meat is available, such animals will take advantage of the situation and eat it. There is a significant difference between cats and all of these other mammals, however. Dogs, people, pigs, bears, and raccoons, etc., are all omnivores that eat meat when it is available. Cats, big and small, are <i>obligatory</i> carnivores. The omnivore does not eat meat as a mandatory requirement for life; vegetable food sources can make up a very large part of their diet, and may even be properly balanced to provide all needed nutrients for health. For the cat, however, meat, and the nutrients found only in meat, are essential for survival.The Cat Is Not a Small DogCritical differences between dogs and cats, the most popular of all household pet animals, are clearly illustrated in the genetic, anatomic, and metabolic differences between the two. Scientists who have studied the dietary habits of carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores tell us that these "rungs" on the food-chain were established and reinforced during the evolutionary histories of each type of animal (see www.catinfo.org/zorans_article.pdf). The work of these experts suggests that the members of the superfamily <i>Feloidea,</i> including today's cat, evolved rapidly in distant prehistoric times, but then stopped abruptly in that progression. Carnivorous animals belonging to other families of animals, including the <i>Canoidea,</i> to which the dog belongs, seem to have progressed beyond this point to meet changing evolutionary needs.Good evidence for the cat's relatively ancient nature can be found in the lower number of chromosomes in its genetic makeup, compared with a much larger number for the group that includes modern dogs. The cat's cells carry thirty-eight chromosomes, while the dog's cells carry seventy-eight. This does not mean that the cat lacks physical and genetic sophistication equal to the dog. It means that it made a perfect and permanent fit within its spot in the environment early on and experienced little additional pressure to change its genes.Dogs and cats also have remarkably different, but highly specialized, anatomy. Dogs have forty-two permanent teeth, whereas cats have only thirty. Dogs have more molars than do cats, with a specialized shape for crushing, associated with their intake of plant material. In contrast, the shape of feline teeth is specialized for grasping and tearing flesh. By its structure, the cat's jaw has far more restricted side-to-side and front-to-back mobility than does the dog's, limiting its ability to grind a varied vegetation-containing diet as the dog can do. The cat's eyes and ears are positioned forward on the head to provide exquisite acuity of vision and hearing when tracking prey, particularly at night. Retractable claws, seen on cats but not dogs, are another specialized feature of an animal that must chase, catch, and bring down all of its food in the form of wild prey.The gastrointestinal tracts of the two species are also quite different. Those differences emphasize the differences in the natural diets of each. Science tells us that modifications in the basic structure of this important organ system from species to species are closely connected to diet. The cat's stomach, caecum (appendix), and colon, segments of the gastrointestinal tract most associated with digestion of vegetable matter, are smaller than those segments in the dog. The length of the feline intestine in proportionto its body length is short compared with that of the dog, indicating that the cat's evolutionary diet was highly digestible (protein and fat), whereas the dog consumes far more vegetable matter. The inner lining of the cat's stomach has significantly greater surface area than does the same part of the dog's stomach. Anatomists believe that increases in the relative size of this stomach area are an adaptation to the digestion of higher-meat, more calorie-dense diets. The caecum in the cat is very primitive, whereas it is much better developed in the dog. Once again, this portion of the gastrointestinal tract assists in the processing of fibrous, nonmeat dietary constituents.Equally telling of the cat's strictly carnivorous origins are its nutrient requirements, especially its requirements for protein. Research done on the 1970s and '80s showed conclusively that protein requirements in kittens and cats far exceed those of puppies or dogs. The cat, unlike omnivores such as the dog, "burns" protein to make energy for its everyday use, under all circumstances. Most other animals burn large amounts of protein for energy only when protein is plentiful in the diet.In contrast, the cat has an ongoing high requirement for protein to turn into energy, even when dietary protein intake is very limited. During starvation or excessive protein-restriction, the cat is forced to disassemble its body's own constituent proteins (enzymes, antibodies, organ tissues, and so on) to produce fuel for energy to keep the cells alive and functioning. Thus, in the most fundamental way, the health and tissue integrity of the cat is dependent upon the continual intake of highly digestible protein, especially protein from meat.Another of the cat's claims to the top-predator spot in the food chain is the absolute requirement for an essential fatty acid, arachidonic acid, found only in meat. Also, cats must consume preformed vitamin A from animal-source foods because they are unable to make this essential vitamin from the beta carotene found in plants. The list of the specializations of the cat's internal machinery that reflect its evolutionary adaptations to a life as an obligatory carnivore goes on and on.Not All Livers Are AlikeBy far, the most fascinating characteristic of the cat compared to omnivores like the dog is the manner in which its liver functions. The cat's very high protein and amino acid requirements arise from the constantly high activity of certain enzymes in the feline liver. These enzymes disassemble the amino acids in protein to make them available for productionof energy in a process called <i>gluconeogenesis.</i> Essentially, the liver is the organ that is responsible for the high and constant burn rate of protein in the cat's body. Omnivores such as the dog have a liver that is also capable of this function, but omnivores turn the rate of this function up or down depending on how much dietary protein is available. In contrast, the cat's liver protein "burn rate" is set high at all times, even when dietary protein is scarce or entirely absent. Death from protein starvation can be very rapid in this species.In the liver, protein amino acids are processed into glucose (sugar) and sent into the bloodstream to supply the body's need for this energy nutrient. In a meat-eating species like the cat, accustomed to little dietary carbohydrate in its evolutionary environment, the liver will manufacture the great majority of the animal's needed glucose, which is the primary energy supply for the animal's brain. Because there is little glucose in a high-meat diet, this is an essential task for an obligatory carnivore. The liver of omnivores, including people and dogs, have multiple enzyme systems for handling dietary carbohydrate; the cat has only one such enzyme system, with limited capacity to deal with high carbohydrate consumption.Such specializations make the cat fit its niche perfectly; indeed, the fittest animal in a niche will be the one with the fewest and simplest systems to meet its survival needs. The cat's ancestors did not need the ability to turn their liver's protein burn rate up and down. Similarly, they did not require significant carbohydrate-handling capabilities. The specialized glucose-from-protein systems that have been genetically retained by the modern cat are always active at a high rate, obligating felines to eat more protein than their omnivorous counterparts. Because of this, unfortunately, the cat will suffer far more harm than will omnivores in situations where protein is insufficient or absent. We will see how important this requirement is when we discuss many of the common diseases of our pet cats.Out of AfricaThe present-day house cat (<i>Felis domesticus</i>) is generally thought to have descended thousands of years ago from a small wild cat (<i>Felis lybica</i>) native to the deserts of North Africa. Such a dry climate heritage would explain many distinct characteristics of this species. Cats are capable of surviving for long periods without water, and will naturally consume very little free water when they are feeding on canned cat food or fresh meat.Cats can produce urine that is highly concentrated compared to that of the dog and other animals that evolved in more water-rich environments. The cat's natural tendency to produce urine with a great deal of metabolic waste in a highly concentrated form can be dangerous if a cat feeds on a diet that is low in water, because this desert animal has a naturally low thirst drive. The cat that is consuming dry cat food seldom drinks enough additional free water to balance the dry state of the food. This results in especially concentrated urine with attendant medical problems, including certain kinds of bladder disease. Dry food also contains ingredients that interfere with the natural acidity of the cat's urine. Highly concentrated, alkaline urine from dry food consumption is associated with serious, even fatal urinary tract problems.The Predator LifestyleThe cat's ancient predator-behaviors are very much a part of its present-day life. Some wild cat species live solitary lives, associating closely with other adults of their species only during mating season. The most familiar of such solitary wild cats is the mountain lion, or cougar (<i>Felis concolor</i>). Other species, such as the African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i>), live relatively sedentary lives in small groups of animals, hunting and caring for the young in a collective manner, with a very defined geography that belongs to each group and which is protected by the group from outsiders that might take resources from that territory. Our pet cats are still very influenced by the primal behavioral instincts of their wild ancestors.The domestic cat is like the lion in its social orientation. Despite the common belief that house cats are aloof and solitary, most naturally prefer to have companionship with a few members of their species. In such groups, which claim set territory with well understood boundaries, there is a clear pecking order, with the leader, or "alpha cat," often a female, living communally with its associates that have decreasing amounts of influence within the group. As long as the range of this group is large enough for the group size, there is general harmony, with only minor dominance "debates" between the alpha and associates.From time to time, however, there may be individuals that do not fit with the group as a whole. For reasons that are not often clear, a young adult may become a pariah, or outcast. Such pariahs are individuals that cannot find friendship with the other cats in the community; rather, they will be chased and sometimes attacked by even other low-levelmembers of the group. In the wild setting, such cats would either leave the colony and seek other outcasts with which to start a new colony, or would live at the edge of the group, finding food and shelter as best they could without interacting with the others. Sometimes a youngster, often a male, will suddenly begin to demonstrate inappropriate and persistent dominance behaviors relative to others with high and low positions within the hierarchy. Dominant behaviors from a nonalpha cat are very disruptive of the welfare of the group and such a cat would also be driven from the colony, unless it can win the battles with older, more established members of the group and take their place in the hierarchy.Feral cat colonies typically have clusters of same-sex cats that associate most closely. Females of reproductive age spend time together, and naturally their young kittens stay close to this female grouping until some time after they are weaned. Young adult males associate with one another in a sort of "bachelor band," but this group does not intermingle much with the females because one or a few older, more dominant males do the breeding that takes place within the colony. Dominant males live more solitary lives, except during the breeding season. Breeding males are highly competitive with one another, and each maintains a subterritory that is his own within the colony. Serious fights occur when a young male or another breeding male invades the well-marked subterritory of an established male. If there is insufficient space within the colony's total territory to allow for each assertive male to have breeding space, someone has to leave. Assertive males that cannot successfully challenge the dominant breeding male will be driven from the group and will seek to establish their own new groups.Understanding these natural group relationships and interactions, and the possibilities for disruption of those dynamics, has great importance for understanding the behavior of pet cats, especially when they are kept in groups indoors.Living with a PredatorThe lesson in taking time to understand the cat's natural physiology and lifestyle is that altering that lifestyle will result in disease and behavioral disability. For all of their advanced intelligence, house cats cannot adjust to highly unnatural living circumstances any better than their much larger wild cousins on the African savannahs or the rain forests of Asia could. <i>The domestic cat is not domestic.</i> It is a small, essentially feral species that has made only modest accommodations to living intimately with humans.I find the attraction some people feel for keeping wild species of felines as pets ironic. The seemingly less-exotic domestic cat is as wild in its mind, heart, and soul as the grand, fierce, big cats could ever be. Today, knowledgeable animal lovers understand that keeping a big cat requires great attention to such a cat's urgent needs for the right food, the right environment, and the right handling. We assume, however, that our house cats are so much different in their requirements for health and well-being. This is a mistaken belief.True, our familiar house cat is not, generally speaking, a dangerous creature capable of killing or injuring us the way big cats are. Its size and deceptive amiability makes it a delightful and easy-to-keep pet. The differences between house cats and the lions, tigers, leopards, and innumerable other wild felines of movies and wildlife documentaries stop there, however. The predator that greets us at the door at the end of a busy workday, that shares our bed on a cold rainy night, and that slumbers in utter contentment on the top of our computer as we work in our office is an ancient, instinctive, hunting machine. I believe that the dreams of our beloved feline pets are filled with the thrill of the chase after prey, the comfort of napping in the incandescent equatorial sun, and the smell of monsoon rains beating relentlessly down on the towering shelt...</p><h2>The Tale of the Devil: The Biography of Devil Anse Hatfield</h2><p>The Tale of the Devil is the story of the legendary Devil Anse Hatfield, beginning with his childhood in frontier Appalachia, describing his Civil War days as a noted Confederate soldier, giving a richly detailed background into just who this man was and from where he came.

She sighed as she relaxed on top of him, her dark eyes closed, a half-�smile on her face.<br><br>There was little Sean enjoyed more than early-�morning sex with Lucy.<br><br>For the first time in months, they were alone&#x2014;�no friends, no family, no stress&#x2014;�sharing a secluded cabin in the middle of the Adirondacks. Just the two of them. Lucy didn&#x2019;t seem to realize how much she&#x2019;d needed this vacation&#x2014;�already, after one night, she was looking more rested than he&#x2019;d seen her in months. Sean hoped their change of plans to help his brother Duke&#x2019;s friend wouldn&#x2019;t put a damper on their week together.<br><br>&#x201c;This is perfect.&#x201d; Lucy kissed his chest. &#x201c;I wish it could last.&#x201d;<br><br>A faint, nagging fear that such unadulterated happiness would come at a cost marred Sean&#x2019;s good mood. He knew Lucy was talking about their time alone, but he couldn&#x2019;t help but think she had been reflecting on their relationship.<br><br>&#x201c;Luce?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d;<br><br>What should he say? That their vacation could last forever? Should he call her out on her skepticism? If he asked her to explain her comment, she&#x2019;d overthink her response, and worse, she&#x2019;d put her shields back up. He&#x2019;d worked hard at getting her to put down her armor; it was these rare moments when she was entirely comfortable that he savored.<br><br>&#x201c;Up for a hike this morning?&#x201d; he asked instead.<br><br>Lucy didn&#x2019;t sound as though she noticed his hesitation. &#x201c;After breakfast. I&#x2019;m starving.&#x201d;<br><br>Sean laughed.<br><br>She leaned up and looked at him, her eyebrows raised. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s funny?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the four months I&#x2019;ve known you, not once have you told me you&#x2019;re hungry, let alone starving.&#x201d;<br><br>He grinned, then reached up and tickled her ribs. Her spontaneous laugh was genuine, such a rare sound that every time he heard it he remembered how much Lucy needed him to remind her of the good in life, and forget the evil from her past.<br><br>&#x201c;This is war!&#x201d; she declared. Before Sean could tighten his abs in resistance, she tickled the sensitive sides of his stomach. He tried grabbing her hands as he laughed, but she enjoyed winning far too much to make it easy for him.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Say Uncle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uncle.&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped, and he flipped her onto her back. &#x201c;Now that you woke me up&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean you weren&#x2019;t awake when we were having sex?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was just a prelude, Princess.&#x201d;<br><br>She tensed, and for a moment Sean thought he&#x2019;d done or said something wrong. He was about to ask her what it was when she said, &#x201c;Do you smell something?&#x201d;<br><br>Her hair, their sweat . . . and something else he recognized only as she spoke. &#x201c;Smoke.&#x201d;<br><br>They jumped up and pulled on the clothes closest to them.<br><br>He grabbed his backpack and they ran out the door, the scent of burning wood palpable as soon as they stepped outside.<br><br>They sprinted down the shadowy trail to the main lodge. Dawn had just broken over the mountain ridge, casting a fresh but pale light all around. A growing plume of dark gray smoke rose from the trees, and as soon as the lodge came into sight Sean saw smoke pouring from an open kitchen window. Several flickers of orange flames glowed through the thick smoke, but the fire hadn&#x2019;t reached the external walls.<br><br>Sean instantly took in the scene: twenty-�two-�year-�old Adam Hendrickson at the water tank struggling with the hose attachment; his older half-�brother Tim bolting across the center clearing, his face a mask of disbelief and rage; the Spruce Lake Inn manager, Annie Lynd, at his heels, her long, dark red braid trailing down her back.<br><br>There was something else&#x2014;�a sound in the background, growing fainter. A motor? Had the saboteur who had caused the Hendricksons&#x2019; extensive property damage over the last several months now moved up to arson?<br><br>Sean scanned the area. Partly obscured by the barn a lone figure dressed in black rode slowly away on an ATV, glancing over his shoulder at the house. When he saw that Sean had spotted him, the rider sped up and disappeared into the trees, hightailing it away from the lodge.<br><br>Sean caught up with Tim and gestured toward the fleeing arsonist. Sean said, &#x201c;I need an ATV.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the barn&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get him! Take care of the fire.&#x201d; Sean sprinted toward the barn.<br><br>Lucy caught up to him as he turned the ignition in the ATV. &#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Always.&#x201d; He took his gun from his backpack and threaded his holster through the loops in his jeans. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll switch my cell to radio, better to communicate short distances. I&#x2019;ll keep in touch.&#x201d;<br><br>Sean sped out of the barn. The arsonist had left a light trail of exhaust, the ground too moist to kick up much dirt. But Sean found the tire tracks in the soft earth and stuck with them, picking up speed, driving the ATV with as much confidence as he drove his Mustang. He lowered the face shield on the helmet and leaned forward. The bastard had picked the wrong way to escape&#x2014;�Sean was boldly proficient on any sort of wheels, from motorcycles to SUVs.<br><br>The Yamaha Raptor he was riding had terrific responsiveness. He reached fifty miles per hour on the straightaway leading into the woods, though he suspected he could push it faster. Any other day, he would enjoy being on this powerful mechanical beast, but today, he had a job to do.<br><br>He was at a slight disadvantage in that he didn&#x2019;t know the area. Whoever was sabotaging the Hendrickson property was most likely a local, born and raised in the Adirondacks. The saboteur also had a big lead&#x2014;�Sean couldn&#x2019;t hear the other quad over his own engine. Without a line of sight, Sean pursued on instincts alone, following the fresh dirt trail the arsonist&#x2019;s ATV left in its wake.<br><br>The trees where Sean had seen the rider disappear came quickly into view, and Sean slowed to maneuver down a trail barely wide enough for the quad. Branches cut into his bare arms and he pulled his elbows in. The cold morning air seeped into his bones, his adrenaline keeping him from shivering.<br><br>The trail wound dangerously through the trees, a foot-�worn path unsuitable for ATVs. Only the newly turned soil told Sean he was heading in the right direction.<br><br>The path came to a sudden end and Sean almost drove straight into the lake. He breaked rapidly and turned ninety degrees, fishtailing. Though the drop was short, the sheer ledge led directly to the water below. Sweating, Sean leaned forward and to the left, using his weight to balance and maintain control.<br><br>For a split second, he thought he&#x2019;d stall out; the quad sputtered and jerked. He eased up on the throttle, rolled back an inch, then gunned it. The engine roared back to life, and Sean let out a relieved sigh.<br><br>He pushed on along the edge of the lake. The initial cold Sean felt wearing only a T-�shirt and jeans had given way to overheating, sweat dampening his shirt. He barely registered the sharp sting of pine needles on his neck when he came too close to a low-�hanging evergreen.<br><br>The trees thinned out and Sean found himself in a clearing about half the size of a football field. It appeared to be a seasonal camping spot, with two wood pits on either side.<br><br>The asshole he was pursuing had spun donuts in the area in an attempt to confuse him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to do better than that, prick,&#x201d; Sean muttered. He ignored the disturbed campground and looked for where the other ATV had exited the clearing. Sean grinned when he found it after less than a minute.<br><br>The rocky trail turned steep quickly, and a sharp turn took him in the opposite direction of the lake. The terrain was becoming more difficult the higher he climbed up the mountain, with large branches that crunched under the quad&#x2019;s wide tires. Sean was forced to slow down to circumvent a rock that, had he hit it, would have flipped the vehicle; at thirty miles an hour he&#x2019;d probably have broken his neck.<br><br>But that meant the arsonist had to slow as well. The chase might end when one of them ran out of gas&#x2014;�Sean hoped it was the other guy.<br><br>A sharp bend in the path nearly sent Sean down the mountainside fifty feet. His back wheels spun off the edge. He was losing ground and almost jumped from the ATV to save his life when the front wheels caught traction and he lurched forward.<br><br>The quad stalled, and he took a moment to breathe. He wouldn&#x2019;t do anyone any good if he ended up dead.<br><br>In the sudden silence, Sean heard the other rider, much closer than he thought. He saw that the path peaked only twenty yards away; the arsonist sounded like he was right on the other side.</p><h2>The Omniverse: Transdimensional Intelligence, Time Travel, the Afterlife, and the Secret Colony on Mars</h2><p>A tour through the new science of the Omniverse, its spiritual and physical dimensions, and its incalculable intelligent civilizations <br> <br>� Reveals the key travel and communication technologies of the Omniverse: time travel, teleportation, and telepathy <br> <br>� Unveils newly disclosed state secrets about these technologies, about the findings of the NASA Mars rover missions, and about a secret colony and life on Mars <br> <br>� Explains through science how souls are holographic fragments of God and how they help create planets, solar systems, galaxies, and universes in the multiverse <br> <br>We are all citizens of the Omniverse, the overarching matrix of energy, spirit, and intelligence that encompasses all that exists: all universes within the multiverse as well as the spiritual dimensions centered on the divine Source that many call God. <br> <br>In this scientific guide to the Omniverse, Alfred Lambremont Webre reveals startling replicable evidence about extraterrestrial and extra-universal life, the intelligent civilizations created by souls in the afterlife, top-secret alien technology, and the existence of a secret base as well as life on Mars. The author explains how our souls are holographic fragments of God/Source and how souls and Source are co-creating planets and galaxies as virtual realities for soul development. He addresses Grey alien control over soul reincarnation and also sheds light on the presence of invisible hyperdimensional controllers known as the Archons, who feed off negative energy. <br> <br>Revealing the key technologies of the Omniverse, the author explains how hyperdimensional civilizations communicate telepathically, teleport interdimensionally, and travel through time. He unveils newly disclosed state secrets about government possession of these technologies, the findings of the NASA Mars rover missions, and the secret Mars colony whose permanent security personnel is age-reversed and shot back through time to their specific space-time origin points--with their memories blocked. <br> <br>Integrating science and spirituality, this map of the dimensions of the Omniverse sounds the call for scientific inquiry into the holographic origins of the soul, the potential of time travel, and our role as divine co-creators with Source.</p><p>Alfred Lambremont Webre is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School and a former Fulbright Scholar.

Basiago, whom I have interviewed many times since the year 2000 on his research into intelligent life on Mars, is a Cambridge-trained environmentalist and attorney at law. He was one of America&#x2019;s early time-space explorers and the first American<b> </b>child to teleport. Mr. Basiago served in DARPA&#x2019;s Project Pegasus from 1968 to 1972, at ages 7 to 11; he was involved in eight different types of time travel that had only recently been achieved by the U.S. defensetechnical community; and he served in a second secret U.S. space project, the CIA&#x2019;s Mars Jump Room program, from 1980 to 1984, during his college years at UCLA. In that capacity, he made about forty trips to Mars via jump room as a U.S. chrononaut. <br> <br>The first formal exophenotypology of intelligent humanoid beings on Mars is based on eyewitness evidence from both Project Pegasus and the CIA jump room program, as well as on photographic evidence from NASA&#x2019;s Mars rovers. <br> <br><b>Five Exophenotypes of Humanoids on Mars</b> <br> <br>Basiago is the first Earth person to summarize publicly the five exophenotypes of bipedal humanoids on Mars. He states, &#x201c;There are five species of bipedal humanoid on Mars. They are: (1) The descendants of Earthlings who went to Mars during the first civilization on Earth that were separated from us by the solar system catastrophe around 11,500 BCE [<i>Homo martis terris</i>]; (2) A species of indigenous Martians [<i>Homo martis martis</i>]; and (3) A stealthy Martian humanoid species that is a branch of the Grey ET&#x2019;s [<i>Homo martis extraterrestrialis</i>]. There are two other primates on Mars, too. They are: (4) A tiny species of hominoid that burrows in the ground [<i>Homo martis deminimis</i>]; and (5) A Bigfoot-like primate [<i>Homo martis sasquatchis</i>]. Mars is their planet. It doesn&#x2019;t belong to us. Mars belongs to the Martians.&#x201d; <br> <br><b>Three Principal Exophenotypes of Humanoids on Mars </b> <br> <br>Basiago writes: <br> <br>There are three principal typologies of humanoid beings on Mars. <i>Homo martis terris</i> are our genetic relatives from the time before the solar system catastrophe of 9,500 BC, when Earth and Mars were in contact. They resemble bald, homely Earthlings. <br> <br><i>Homo martis martis</i> are the indigenous Martian humanoids. They have narrower heads, pointier ears, longer fingers, and smaller bodies than Earthlings. They resemble the creature in the vintage film <i>Nosferatu</i>. We were advised that if hungry enough, they would sometimes kill and eat human visitors from Earth, so we should be wary of them. <br> <br><i>Homo martis extraterrestrialis</i> resemble the Grey ETs of the UFO contact literature. This is the type that Courtney M. Hunt and William B. Stillings and I of the CIA&#x2019;s jump room program encountered after I saw one that was sitting on the roof of the jump room facility called The Corkscrew when we arrived on Mars one time in 1981. As I exited The Corkscrew ahead of my fellow chrononauts, I called out to them, &#x201c;Court, Brett! A Grey. On the roof. Observing us!&#x201d; They are probably the result of a branch of the Greys that was left back on Mars at some time in Martian history. <br> <br><b>Martian Humanoid Exophenotypes </b> <br> <br>U.S. CIA Jump Room Program <br> <br>Basiago reports observing two of the three principal exophenotypes of Martian humanoids while on Mars during trips in service on the CIA Mars Jump Room program. These two are <i>Homo martis martis</i> and <i>Homo martis extraterrestrialis.</i> <br> <br><b>Question</b>: What did you see while on Mars? What is Mars like? Is it inhabited? <br> <br><b>Andrew Basiago</b>: Mars has a desert environment with scant water, sparse vegetation, and about 30 major land species. It has a blue sky and soils that range from light pink to rust red. During my 40 or so jumps, I encountered several animal species, including a predator that had a head like a Tyrannosaurus rex and a supple body,and a plesiosaur that was also a predator, with teeth running all the way down its throat. I met one of the <i>Homo martis martis</i> type of humanoid when he met Courtney M. Hunt and I at the jump room facility called the Corkscrew and took us on a tour of his underground civilization, and I would see both adult and children of this type when I would walk through a dilapidated brick city to deliver a data disk to a telecommunications post that we had established there. Once, I saw one of the <i>Homo martis extraterrestrialis</i> species when I was exiting the Corkscrew with Courtney M. Hunt and William B. Stillings soon after arriving on Mars via jump room. It was lurking atop the jump room facility. <br> <br><b>Evaluating the Witness Evidence for Indigenous Martian Intelligent Life</b> <br> <br>The eyewitness evidence of Andrew D. Basiago about indigenous Martian intelligent life, both on the surface and under the surface of Mars, is highly credible. His verbal and written accounts have been consistent and verified by available witnesses and by documentary evidence, including written versions of his evidence that he has made available to me. <br> <br>Basiago is extremely conscientious in the execution of his duties as an officer of the court and a member of the bar of the State of Washington. The professional penalties for an officer of the court who engages in public deception or fraud regarding an issue of public importance could be grave. <br> <br>Along with Basiago, former U.S. chrononauts William B. Stillings and Bernard Mendez, each a credible whistleblower eyewitness to intelligent life on Mars, have made their testimonies public at considerable personal risk.<b> <br></b></p><h2>The Human Line</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Poetry,&#x201d; writes best-selling author Ellen Bass, &#x201c;is the way I pay attention, appreciate, give praise, struggle, grieve, rage, and pray.

I knew that, and I knew other tribes used the same word, because my wife, Jody, and I had just recently finished six months of Kipsigis (kip-suh-geez) language school and were serving our first term with World Gospel Mission at Tenwek Hospital in the beautiful highlands of the Kericho District in southwestern Kenya. At age thirty, after years of planning, praying, and preparing and after packing up my young family and moving eight thousand miles away from home, I felt excited to have finally begun my life&#x2019;s work as a missionary doctor. I was still very much a rookie, but on this particular Sunday, I happened to be the senior physician on duty at the hospital. The older doctors were gone. Thus, I would be expected to handle&#x2014;on my own&#x2014;any emergencies or medical crises that arose. Since I had done my residency in family practice, I felt capable of dealing with the vast majority of routine cases I&#x2019;d encountered since my arrival at Tenwek just months before. But I confess to feeling a little leery about what surgical emergencies might come in the door during the absence of my more experienced colleagues. That day my worst nightmare came true. Sundays were always different from the normal daily routine. As the doctor on call, I had seen the sickest patients, examined new admissions, and checked the maternity ward for problems. I missed church and got home late for lunch, hoping to catch up on a little correspondence. It was about four o&#x2019;clock on a sunny afternoon when the call came from the hospital saying we&#x2019;d just received a trauma patient who needed immediate surgery&#x2014;something about a panga wound. I sprinted up the hill through the compound to the hospital, arriving at the OR short of breath from the high altitude and totally unprepared for what I saw in front of me. A forty-year-old Kipsigis man, covered in blood, was lying on the operating table. The blow from a machete had caught him across the bridge of his nose and sliced all the way across and through his face, down to the bottom of his jaw. His face had been literally cut in two, with the lower half peeled forward and lying on his chest. The patient was in shock and struggling for breath. Amazed that the man hadn&#x2019;t bled out and died on his way to the hospital, I gave orders to mobilize what we at Tenwek referred to as our "walking blood bank." That is, we put out a call for any missionaries or hospital staff on the compound with matching blood type to quickly donate enough blood to save this patient. Meantime, the nurse had started an IV and fluids were running wide open. I ordered a second IV in the other arm as I worked to secure his airway because the patient was in danger of choking to death from blood and his own secretions. The quickest and easiest thing would have been to intubate him, but that would have required placing an endotracheal tube into his throat&#x2014;right through the middle of his gaping wound. I had no choice but to perform my second emergency tracheostomy ever&#x2014;no small challenge without proper anesthesia or instruments. I breathed a big sigh of relief once I&#x2019;d cut open his neck, placed the tube directly into the trachea, and saw the patient immediately begin breathing more easily. As soon as we got the man stabilized, I literally ran from the OR to the doctors&#x2019; "office," a closet-sized room where we kept the hospital&#x2019;s medical library. I didn&#x2019;t even know what to call this type of wound, but it probably wasn&#x2019;t in any index anyway. I grabbed our only orthopedic atlas and hurriedly thumbed through pictures and diagrams searching for something that looked like my patient&#x2019;s case. It was time to do what we often call on the mission field "a little cookbook surgery." For some reason American medical texts don&#x2019;t contain much about machete wounds of the face. The closest thing I could find was in an orthopedic text showing a diagram for repairing different types of maxilla (upper jaw) fractures. Le Fort-type fractures are facial injuries that occur most often in automobile accidents where people are smashed into the dash so violently that the maxilla is fractured all the way across their cheekbones. Actually, the textbook diagram I found only showed bones separated less than a quarter of an inch, so they didn&#x2019;t look much like my patient, whose entire face was lying open. The similarity was in the fact that these Le Fort fractures also resulted in a separation of facial bones and required literally pulling those bones (and the face) back together. Deciding this was probably as close an example as I was going to find, I started reading the text even as I rushed back to surgery. By the time I walked into the OR, however, I realized I hadn&#x2019;t found the solution, but merely defined the problem. What good is a cookbook if you lack the ingredients? The first step mentioned in the text was to wire the upper and lower teeth together with "arch bars." I had never seen a set of arch bars, let alone applied them. I showed the nurse the picture (she had never seen arch bars either) and sent her to the hospital storage room on the slim chance she could find a set&#x2014;or at least uncover something else, anything, we might use to make do. Then I propped the text open on a stand beside the operating table and began looking back and forth between my patient and the pictures in the book to decide where and how to start putting this man&#x2019;s face back together. I knew if I didn&#x2019;t, he would certainly die.</p><h2>A Natural History of the Mojave Desert</h2><p>The Mojave Desert has a rich natural history.

The dirty bankers and businessmen he befriended--some of whom still shape power across the globe--knew him as Bob Musella, a wealthy, mob-connected big shot living the good life. Together they partied in $1,000-per-night hotel suites, drank bottles of the world's finest champagne, drove Rolls-Royce convertibles, and flew in private jets. But under Mazur's Armani suits and in his Renwick briefcase, recorders whirred silently, capturing the damning evidence of their crimes.<br><i><br>The Infiltrator</i> is the story of how Mazur helped bring down the unscrupulous bankers who manipulated complex international finance systems to serve drug lords, corrupt politicians, tax cheats, and terrorists. It is a shocking chronicle of the rise and fall of one of the biggest and most intricate money-laundering operation of all time-an enterprise that cleaned and moved hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Filled with dangerous lies, near misses, and harrowing escapes,<i> The Infiltrator</i> is as bracing and explosive as the greatest fiction thrillers--only it's all true.</p><p>Robert Mazur was a federal agent for 27 years. During 5 years of his law enforcement career he was a long-term undercover agent operating in deep cover within the underworld as a high-level money launderer for senior members of Colombian drug cartels. He not only dealt directly with cartel leaders, but also functioned as their counduit to corrupt international bankers around the world. He is court-certified in both the U.S. and Canada as an expert in money laundering. Mr. Mazur has been a significant contributor to news and media outlets, including The New York Times, PBS, ABC and NBC."One of the largest money laundering prosecutions in U.S. History."<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Robert Mueller III, director of the FBI and former assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice<br></i></b><br><br>"Robert Mazur not only took the lead undercover role, but fought valiantly against the bureaucratic difficulties. . . .

A very compelling read."&#x2015;<b><i>Joseph Pistone aka Donnie Brasco</i></b></p><h2>The Brief History of the Dead</h2><p><p>From Kevin Brockmeier, one of this generation's most inventive young writers, comes a striking new novel about death, life, and the mysterious place in between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The City is inhabited by those who have departed Earth but are still remembered by the living. They will reside in this afterlife until they are completely forgotten. But the City is shrinking, and the residents clearing out. Some of the holdouts, like Luka Sims, who produces the City&#x2019;s only newspaper, are wondering what exactly is going on. Others, like Coleman Kinzler, believe it is the beginning of the end. Meanwhile, Laura Byrd is trapped in an Antarctic research station, her supplies are running low, her radio finds only static, and the power is failing. With little choice, Laura sets out across the ice to look for help, but time is running out. Kevin Brockmeier alternates these two storylines to create a lyrical and haunting story about love, loss and the power of memory.</p></p><p><p>In addition to his most recent work,<i>&nbsp;A Few Seconds of Radiant Filmstrip,</i>&nbsp;<b>KEVIN BROCKMEIER</b>&nbsp;is the author of the novels&nbsp;<i>The Illumination, The Brief History of the Dead,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Truth About Celia;</i>&nbsp;the story collections&nbsp;<i>Things That Fall from the Sky</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The View from the Seventh Layer;</i>&nbsp;and the children&#x2019;s novels&nbsp;<i>City of Names and Grooves: A Kind of Mystery.</i>&nbsp;His work has been translated into seventeen languages.

First he had died, he said, and then&#x2013;snap!&#x2013;the desert. He told the story to everyone who would listen, bobbing his head to follow the sound of their footsteps. Showers of red grit fell from his beard. He said that the desert was bare and lonesome and that it had hissed at him like a snake. He had walked for days and days, until the dunes broke apart beneath his feet, surging up around him to lash at his face. Then everything went still and began to beat like a heart. The sound was as clear as any he had ever heard. It was only at that moment, he said, with a million arrow points of sand striking his skin, that he truly realized he was dead.<br><br>Jim Singer, who managed the sandwich shop in the monument district, said that he had felt a prickling sensation in his fingers and then stopped breathing. "It was my heart," he insisted, thumping firmly on his chest. "Took me in my own bed." He had closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, he was on a train, the kind that trolleys small children around in circles at amusement parks. The rails were leading him through a thick forest of gold-brown trees, but the trees were actually giraffes, and their long necks were reaching like branches into the sky. A wind rose up and peeled the spots from their backs. The spots floated down around him, swirling and dipping in the wake of the train. It took him a long time to understand that the throbbing noise he heard was not the rattling of the wheels along the tracks.<br><br>The girl who liked to stand beneath the poplar tree in the park said that she had died into an ocean the color of dried cherries. For a while the water had carried her weight, she said, and she had lain on her back turning in meaningless circles, singing the choruses of the pop songs she remembered. But then there was a drum of thunder, and the clouds split open, and the ball bearings began to pelt down around her&#x2013;tens of thousands of them. She had swallowed as many as she could, she said, stroking the cracked trunk of the poplar tree. She didn't know why. She filled like a canvas sack and sank slowly through the layers of the ocean. Shoals of fish brushed past her, their blue and yellow scales the single brightest thing in the water. And all around her she heard that sound, the one that everybody heard, the regular pulsing of a giant heart.<br><br>The stories people told about the crossing were as varied and elaborate as their ten billion lives, so much more particular than those other stories, the ones they told about their deaths. After all, there were only so many ways a person could die: either your heart took you, or your head took you, or it was one of the new diseases. But no one followed the same path over the crossing. Lev Paley said that he had watched his atoms break apart like marbles, roll across the universe, then gather themselves together again out of nothing at all. Hanbing Li said that he woke inside the body of an aphid and lived an entire life in the flesh of a single peach. Graciella Cavazos would say only that she began to snow&#x2013;four words&#x2013;and smile bashfully whenever anyone pressed her for details.<br><br>No two reports were ever the same. And yet always there was the drumlike thumping noise.<br><br>Some people insisted that it never went away, that if you concentrated and did not turn your ear from the sound, you could hear it faintly behind everything in the city&#x2013;the brakes and the horns, the bells on the doors of restaurants, the clicking and slapping of different kinds of shoes on the pavement. Groups of people came together in parks or on rooftops just to listen for it, sitting quietly with their backs turned to one another. <i>Ba-dum. Ba-dum. Ba-dum</i>. It was like trying to keep a bird in sight as it lifted, blurred, and faded to a dot in the sky.<br><br>Luka Sims had found an old mimeograph machine his very first week in the city and decided to use it to produce a newspaper. He stood outside the River Road Coffee Shop every morning, handing out the circulars he had printed. One particular issue of the <i>L. Sims News &amp; Speculation Sheet</i>&#x2013;or the <i>Sims Sheet</i>, as people called it&#x2013;addressed the matter of this sound. Fewer than twenty percent of the people Luka interviewed claimed that they could still hear it after the crossing, but almost everyone agreed that it resembled nothing so much as&#x2013;could be nothing other than&#x2013;the pounding of a heart. The question, then, was, Where did it come from? It could not be their own hearts, for their hearts no longer beat. The old man Mahmoud Qassim believed that it was not the actual sound of his heart, but the remembered sound, which, because he had both heard and failed to notice it for so long, still resounded in his ears. The woman who sold bracelets by the river thought that it was the heartbeat at the center of the world, that bright, boiling place she had fallen through on her way to the city. "As for this reporter," the article concluded, "I hold with the majority. I have always suspected that the thumping sound we hear is the pulse of those who are still alive. The living carry us inside them like pearls. We survive only so long as they remember us." It was an imperfect metaphor&#x2013;Luka knew that&#x2013;since the pearl lasts much longer than the oyster. But rule one in the newspaper business was that you had to meet your deadlines. He had long since given up the quest for perfection.<br><br>There were more people in the city every day, and yet the city never failed to accommodate them. You might be walking down a street you had known for years, and all of a sudden you would come upon another building, another whole block. Carson McCaughrean, who drove one of the sleek black taxis that roamed the streets, had to redraw his maps once a week. Twenty, thirty, fifty times a day, he would pick up a fare who had only recently arrived in the city and have to deliver him somewhere he&#x2013;Carson&#x2013;had never heard of. They came from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. They came from churning metropolises and from small islands in the middle of the ocean. That was what the living did: they died. There was an ancient street musician who began playing in the red brick district as soon as he reached the city, making slow, sad breaths with his accordion. There was a jeweler, a young man, who set up shop at the corner of Maple and Christopher Streets and sold diamonds that he mounted on silver pendants. Jessica Auffert had operated her own jewelry shop on the same corner for more than thirty years, but she did not seem to resent the man, and in fact brought him a mug of fresh black coffee every morning, exchanging gossip as she drank with him in his front room. What surprised her was how young he was&#x2013;how young so many of the dead were these days. Great numbers of them were no more than children, who clattered around on skateboards or went racing past her window on their way to the playground. One, a boy with a strawberry discoloration on his cheek, liked to pretend that the rocking horses he tossed himself around on were real horses, the horses he had brushed and fed on his farm before they were killed in the bombing. Another liked to swoop down the slide over and over again, hammering his feet into the gravel as he thought about his parents and his two older brothers, who were still alive. He had watched them lift free of the same illness that had slowly sucked him under. He did not like to talk about it.<br><br>This was during a war, though it was difficult for any of them to remember which one.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Occasionally one of the dead, someone who had just completed the crossing, would mistake the city for heaven. It was a misunderstanding that never persisted for long. What kind of heaven had the blasting sound of garbage trucks in the morning, and chewing gum on the pavement, and the smell of fish rotting by the river? What kind of hell, for that matter, had bakeries and dogwood trees and perfect blue days that made the hairs on the back of your neck rise on end? No, the city was not heaven, and it was not hell, and it certainly was not the world. It stood to reason, then, that it had to be something else. More and more people came to adopt the theory that it was an extension of life itself&#x2013;a sort of outer room&#x2013;and that they would remain there only so long as they endured in living memory. When the last person who had actually known them died, they would pass over into whatever came next. It was true that most of the city's occupants went away after sixty or seventy years, and while this did not prove the theory, it certainly served to nourish it. There were stories of men and women who had been in the city much longer, for centuries and more, but there were always such stories, in every time and place, and who knew whether to believe them?<br><br>Every neighborhood had its gathering spot, a place where people could come together to trade news of the other world. There was the colonnade in the monument district, and the One and Only Tavern in the warehouse district, and right next to the greenhouse, in the center of the conservatory district, was Andrei Kalatozov's Russian Tea Room. Kalatozov poured the tea he brewed from a brass samovar into small porcelain cups that he served on polished wooden platters. His wife and daughter had died a few weeks before he did, in an accident involving a land mine they had rooted up out of the family garden. He was watching through the kitchen window when it happened. His wife's spade struck a jagged hunk of metal, so cankered with rust from its century underground that he did not realize what it was until it exploded. Two weeks later, when he put the razor to his throat, it was with the hope that he would be reunited with his family in heaven. And, sure enough, there they were&#x2013;his wife and daughter&#x2013;smiling and taking coats at the door of the tea room. Kalatozov watched them as he sliced a lemon into wedges and arranged the wedges on a saucer. He was the happiest man in the room&#x2013;the happiest man in any room. The city may not have been heaven, but it was heaven enough for him. Morning to evening, he listened to his customers as they shared the latest news about the war. The Americans and the Middle East had resumed hostilities, as had China and Spain and Australia and the Netherlands. Brazil was developing another mutagenic virus, one that would resist the latest antitoxins. Or maybe it was Italy. Or maybe Indonesia. There were so many rumors that it was hard to know for sure.<br><br>Now and then someone who had died only a day or two before would happen into one of the centers of communication&#x2013;the tavern or the tea room, the river market or the colonnade&#x2013;and the legions of the dead would mass around him, shouldering and jostling him for information. It was always the same: "Where did you live?" "Do you know anything about Central America?" "Is it true what they're saying about the ice caps?" "I'm trying to find out about my cousin. He lived in Arizona. His name was Lewis Zeigler, spelled L-e-w-i-s..." "What's happening with the situation along the African coast--do you know, do you know?" "Anything you can tell us, please, anything at all."<br><br>Kiran Patel had sold beads to tourists in the Bombay hotel district for most of a century. She said that there were fewer and fewer travelers to her part of the world, but that this hardly mattered, since there was less and less of her part of the world for them to see. The ivory beads she had peddled as a young woman had become scarce, then rare, then finally unobtainable. The only remaining elephants were caged away in the zoos of other countries. In the years just before she died, the "genuine ivory beads" she sold were actually a cream-colored plastic made in batches of ten thousand in Korean factories. This, too, hardly mattered. The tourists who stopped at her kiosk could never detect the difference.<br><br>Jeffrey Fallon, sixteen and from Park Falls, Wisconsin, said that the fighting hadn't spread in from the coasts yet, but that the germs had, and he was living proof. "Or not living, maybe, but still proof," he corrected himself. The bad guys used to be Pakistan, and then they were Argentina and Turkey, and after that he had lost track. "What do you want me to tell you?" he asked, shrugging his shoulders. "Mostly I just miss my girlfriend." Her name was Tracey Tipton, and she did this thing with his earlobes and the notched edge of her front teeth that made his entire body go taut and buzz like a guitar string. He had never given his earlobes a second thought until the day she took them between her lips, but now that he was dead he thought of nothing else. Who would have figured?<br><br>The man who spent hours riding up and down the escalators in the Ginza Street Shopping Mall would not give his name. When people asked him what he remembered about the time before he died, he would only nod vigorously, clap his hands together, and say, "Boom!," making a gesture like falling confetti with his fingertips. <br><br><b>Excerpted from <i>The Brief History of the Dead</i> by Kevin Brockmeier Copyright � 2006 by Kevin Brockmeier.

She felt herself transported to a garden and engaging in a revelatory conversation with a spiritual being. When she recovered, her most fundamental understandings of what the world is and how it works had been completely transformed. She was &#x201c;changed in a flash,&#x201d; suddenly able to interact with those who had died and have prescient dreams predicting news events. She came to believe that some early traumatic and abusive experiences had played a part in preparing her for this experience. <br> &nbsp;<br> Told in matter-of-fact language, the first half of this book is the story of Krohn&#x2019;s journey, and the second is an interpretation and analysis by respected professor of religion Jeffrey J. Kripal. He places Krohn's experience in the context of religious traditions and proposes the groundbreaking idea that we are shaping our own experiences in the future by how we engage with near-death experiences in the present. <i>Changed in a Flash</i> is not about proving a story, but about carving out space for serious discussion of this phenomenon.</p><p>ELIZABETH GREENFIELD KROHN was a wife and mother of two young boys when she was struck by lightning in the parking lot of her Houston synagogue, and her most fundamental understandings of what the world is and how it works were completely transformed.

Such a case is covered in the first part of the book. But it&#x2019;s the second part that explores how to interpret the&nbsp;<i>meaning&nbsp;</i>of NDEs. Are they literally true reports of the afterlife, or hallucinatory dreams of a dying brain, or something much stranger?&nbsp;<i>Changed in a Flash&nbsp;</i>explores each of these interpretations, and it ends with a stunning conclusion.

Is that how you would describe yourself?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I find that nothing makes people back away faster at a social gathering than "accordionist." Except perhaps "screenwriter." And, even "author" always makes people nervous, so I usually say "writer." <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> How long have you been writing?<br> <strong>A:</strong> All my life really, since I was <em>able</em> to write all I wanted to do was write. I think largely I ended up becoming a writer because I could think of nothing else that I was good at--at all. As a kid, I always wanted to be a writer, and I had no backup plan whatsoever as an adult.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Are the Baudelaire children ever going to be happy?<br> <strong>A:</strong> Well, they are happy on a regular basis, just not for very long. Um, are they ever going to be happy permanently? I don't know any permanently happy people, thank goodness.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Okay, then is the series going to end on a happy note?<br> <strong>A:</strong> Well, I always remind readers of the Snicket books that happy is a comparative term, so the end will be happier than some people would think, but less happy than others.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> When can fans expect the final book?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I believe the thirteenth volume will be released in the fall of 2006, although something terrible could happen to the author at any moment and then the books would not be released at all.<br><br> Looking for more from Daniel Handler?

She lives in Central Texas.Introduction<br><br>The subject matter of the twenty stories in <i>The O. Henry Prize Stories</i> is so varied that even naming it feels reductive: a violent home invasion, an illiterate writer of letters from the dead, a retrospective homage to a failed marriage, an inconspicuous man in a very small town who bears witness to the great world&#x2019;s horrors.<br><br>It becomes second nature for passionate readers to identify and consider the elements of fiction: plot, language, characters, setting. Subject matter seems like the most obvious one, yet is perhaps the least important in the long run. While an interesting subject might initially attract readers, it won&#x2019;t keep them there unless the formal elements are in balance.<br><br>For the author, subject matter is more complicated. Each element of a story can seem to have its own notion of its importance, so that the writer often feels in control of nothing. Add to this the fact that a writer can start with one idea of what the story is about and end by realizing that it&#x2019;s about something else entirely. Many authors say that they write to understand their own lives, so that even when a writer thinks she&#x2019;s creating a unique, completely invented character, she isn&#x2019;t surprised to recognize someone she knows lurking in the portrait&#x2014;or even herself.<br><br>Nothing matters in the end except the story itself.<br><br>After you have completed a story in <i>The O. Henry Prize Stories 2018</i>, you might find you have two different answers to the questions &#x201c;What is the subject matter?&#x201d; and &#x201c;What is the heart of the story?&#x201d; And if you turn to &#x201c;Writing The O.

And yet, as in any short story, there&#x2019;s a story underneath the story, and this understory is immediately hinted at by the second clause of the first sentence: &#x201c;She struck her attacker in the head with a shovel, a small one that she normally kept in the trunk of her car for moving things off the highway.&#x201d; Surely every reader wants to say, Who cares how big the shovel is or why she keeps it in her trunk? Get on with the fight. The first clause is so strong that the reader wants to know what happens next, which is one definition of plot.<br><br>But we care about the shovel at least in part because the story is also about the particulars of the antagonists. We learn their names and stories, what each of them cares about, and how they came to be in the house at the same moment. We also learn where their minds are wandering, through passages that step away from the physical struggle. The mind never stops wandering, not even when the body is fighting for survival. Beard catches perfectly each character&#x2019;s strong will to live. By the story&#x2019;s end, the reader is fascinated as much by their mental ramblings as by the specifics of the struggle, and in this way &#x201c;The Tomb of Wrestling&#x201d; resembles what we call real life.<br><br>Marjorie Celona&#x2019;s &#x201c;Counterblast,&#x201d; chosen by 2018 juror Ottessa Moshfegh as her favorite story (p. 348), is funny, wry, sad, and full of energy. The narrator tells about the failure of her marriage and what she was like as the mother of an infant. The action centers on the death of her father-in-law and her interactions with her husband and his sister. The most intimate relationship is between mother and baby. While many mothers can anticipate their baby&#x2019;s desire for food, a change of diaper, or sleep, our narrator is so attached that she feels little else but her yearning to be with her child. Adults make little sense to her; they&#x2019;re annoying and their motivations impossible to discern. She&#x2019;s set apart from her peers because of her desires, her unnamed and inchoate feelings that are the understory beneath the comedy of child care, in-laws, and her recurrent annoyance with her handsome husband, for whom life seems to be very easy. The last line of &#x201c;Counterblast&#x201d; is at first a puzzlement and then a revelation.<br><br>&#x201c;Nayla&#x201d; by Youmna Chlala begins with a place: &#x201c;There was sun and then there was more sun and more sun. You can&#x2019;t imagine loss when it&#x2019;s sunny. . . . I was still in this camp in the desert, worming my way into acceptance while years&#x2014;let&#x2019;s count them . . . something like 365 � 6 + however many days&#x2014;had gone by.&#x201d; The word acceptance has two meanings here: acceptance into another country, which every refugee needs, and acceptance by another person, which every person desires.<br><br>At a party, the narrator meets Nayla, her cousin Marwan&#x2019;s girlfriend, an ambiguous figure because she is a widow, and they become friends.<br><br>That summer, I practically lived in her apartment, a tiny place right above her late husband&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s house. I&#x2019;d come over and we&#x2019;d drink prosecco (pretending we were in Italy) and invent recipes together. We traded food for the bubbly wine with Ahmad, the liquor store manager. We made him fish fattoush; lamb-stuffed eggplant; pistachio, orange, and cardamom cookies; and vegetarian kibbeh with extra pine nuts.<br><br>Lucky Ahmad! Slowly the two young women come to trust each other, to share their losses and to confide what it is to be a survivor. The richness of their friendship in what is essentially a prison is perfectly conveyed by Chlala&#x2019;s gifted prose.<br><br>&#x201c;Lucky Dragon&#x201d; by Viet Dinh also begins with the sun, though this is a sun that betokens devastation: &#x201c;The second dawn rose in the east, at nine in the morning.&#x201d; In the nonchalance of this first sentence, Dinh warns his reader that something is terribly wrong. The order of things is disturbed. The second dawn is no dawn at all but a nuclear explosion, a test by the Americans.<br><br>One member of the Lucky Dragon crew dies quickly and is buried at sea. The rest don&#x2019;t merely sicken and die; they first suffer horribly, including the ship&#x2019;s captain, Hiroshi, and his friend Yoshi. Some of the crew previously survived the Tokyo firebombings, others the battles in the Pacific. Hiroshi and Yoshi were together as soldiers in the Philippines and as prisoners of war. Together they transform into unrecognizable creatures as their skin scales and hardens. Dinh portrays not only their physical suffering but what their nation makes of them: first as victims, next heroes, finally as monsters. Their treatment makes a mockery of politics, nationalism, and military pride. In the end, Hiroshi and Yoshi have only death, the sea, and each other.<br><br>Michael Parker&#x2019;s &#x201c;Stop &#x2019;n&#x2019; Go&#x201d; is a two-paragraph story whose emotional depth is masked by the banality of the main character. He is stoical, much attached to his habits, clothing, and schedules. His children have gone away. He no longer farms but still surveys his fields, now rented out to a company from out of state. We see his wife in her housecoat &#x201c;wordlessly&#x201d; making his customary breakfast. Nothing in the present quite makes sense to him. &#x201c;Maybe I have outlived time,&#x201d; he thinks.<br><br>So far, so good. Maybe the reader thinks that, aside from Parker&#x2019;s elegant prose, this story about a grumpy old guy has nothing to reveal. Then, in the middle of the paragraph, everything changes. The old farmer&#x2019;s world seemed entirely local, but the reader learns that it&#x2019;s larger and more awful than it appears to be. With the words &#x201c;In the war,&#x201d; we&#x2019;re taken back to his youth, back to war in another country, to being wounded, to a moment of unexpected desire, to seeing the worst that one human being can do to another, and then to seeing people whose ways are, to him, even more incomprehensible, more foreign and haunting.<br><br>Dounia Choukri&#x2019;s &#x201c;Past Perfect Continuous&#x201d; is another meditation on war and memory but it&#x2019;s also a disquisition on time, as the title indicates. Here are war, time, and memory&#x2014;her family&#x2019;s past and her present&#x2014;considered by a young German woman. She comes from stolid women, &#x201c;married to reasonable men with ice-blue eyes, men who only traveled in wartime.&#x201d; Her family is bent on forgetting and denying their country&#x2019;s (and their own) recent past. They yearn for the better days of a whitewashed past, whether embodied by Gene Kelly&#x2019;s dancing or recollections of past winters, which &#x201c;aren&#x2019;t what they used to be!&#x201d; The narrator, stranded in her adolescence, observes that &#x201c;there&#x2019;s a particular loneliness to sitting down at a table others have already eaten at, flicking at hard crumbs and tracing the rings of cleared glasses with your finger.&#x201d; And then Aunt Gunhild, the narrator&#x2019;s Nazi great-aunt, makes a visit, much to the family&#x2019;s chagrin. She is &#x201c;a smoker in a family in which women . . . didn&#x2019;t smoke,&#x201d; and a living ghost from the past, a living answer to the narrator&#x2019;s question, &#x201c;But what about the Second World War, huh?&#x201d; The visit of her transgressive relative is inspiring to the narrator, an awkward thirteen-year-old, who&#x2019;s unprepared for what the future seems to offer&#x2014;&#x201c;breasts, bras, boys.&#x201d; In the atmosphere of her family&#x2019;s nostalgia for a past that never existed, she tells the reader, &#x201c;Part of me wished for a past without the need to fill in the present.&#x201d;<br><br>Aunt Gunhild has lost the right to be nostalgic for her past. Through her visit, the narrator learns that time can be a false analgesic and that it&#x2019;s hard to learn time&#x2019;s lessons: &#x201c;When the past sucks it just becomes a welcome lesson on how not to do things.&#x201d; &#x201c;Past Perfect Continuous&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t only a story about German history, it&#x2019;s also a tracing of a young girl&#x2019;s growth toward independence and a liberation as glorious and complicated as the fall of the Berlin Wall.<br><br>Thomas Bolt&#x2019;s &#x201c;Inversion of Marcia&#x201d; is also narrated by a young girl. Mary&#x2019;s on a family vacation with her parents; her older sister, Marcia; and the gorgeous and seductive Alicia, who is helping out &#x201c;in exchange for a free trip to Italy.&#x201d;<br><br>Not surprisingly, complications ensue. The parents withdraw into their own problems, reappearing periodically to drive the girls to Naples and other sights. A painful triangulation develops as Mary observes her sister&#x2019;s increasingly sexual involvement with Alicia. Alicia&#x2019;s wardrobe and makeup, the attitudes she strikes, the cigarettes she smokes, all seem perfect and perfectly annoying to our shrewd narrator. Mary knows that she&#x2019;s about to lose childhood&#x2019;s freedom to the questionable joys of adolescence. She watches Alicia and Marcia like a disapproving hawk, hovering and waiting to be included.<br><br>Thomas Bolt&#x2019;s generous story is told with a bit of a novel&#x2019;s discursiveness but he maintains the story&#x2019;s tight focus on Mary&#x2019;s quiet maturing and how she comes to understand something of the adult life she will soon undertake. She&#x2019;s torn between copying Alicia&#x2019;s ways and detesting them; between hating and loving her sister as Marcia moves through her first love affair; between thinking of her parents as distant monoliths and seeing their adult troubles as real and perhaps even forgivable.<br><br>Marwand, the Afghan-American narrator of Jamil Jan Kochai&#x2019;s &#x201c;Nights in Logar,&#x201d; is on an expedition to find the fierce and unfriendly family dog, Budabash, who&#x2019;s somehow gotten free. It&#x2019;s a hot day and the mission is a welcome distraction but also dangerous, even in the current lull or temporary &#x201c;coma&#x201d; in the American war.<br><br>Marwand is in the company of Gul and Dawoud, his almost-peer uncles, and his cousin Zia; the boys range in age from twelve to fourteen. Unlike Marwand, who&#x2019;s there on a visit from his home in America to his mother&#x2019;s family village, Gul is wise in the ways of Logar and declares that only four of them can go looking for the dog. Marwand&#x2019;s younger brother cannot be invited along. &#x201c; &#x2018;More than four,&#x2019; he told me and Zia and Dawoud as we sat between the chicken coop and the kamoot, &#x2018;and we&#x2019;ll look like a mob, but any less and we might get jumped or robbed.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Part of the reader&#x2019;s entertainment in Kochai&#x2019;s lively story is the mix of American slang with Pakhto, a duality that highlights Marwand&#x2019;s double existence. (On losing a bid to include his brother, here is his response: &#x201c; &#x2018;Well, fuck,&#x2019; I muttered, in English, and relented to the will of the jirga.&#x201d;) Marwand has two nationalities, two homes, two identities, and is at times comfortable with neither.<br><br>Even the missing dog is part of a duality. On first arriving, Marwand rushed to him, mistaking him for a favorite dog from years before. Budabash bites off the tip of Marwand&#x2019;s finger, proving that he is not the Mr. Kareem of old, not an American dog to be &#x201c;hugged and petted and neutered&#x201d; but &#x201c;a mutant,&#x201d; perhaps like Marwand, neither one thing nor the other.<br><br>The four hunters see many things, and before long a numbered list of what Marwand sees reaches number twenty-one. They wend through graveyards and among slaughtered sheep, under mulberry trees and out in the open, over land possibly mined; they hunt until it is dark, darker than it ever is in the streets of Marwand&#x2019;s America. Whatever America means to Marwand, with its safety and its grand promises for his future, it remains hard for him to measure it against Logar, where there&#x2019;s a prayer and a story and an obligation to structure the days and nights, and the familiarity of his family village.<br><br>The life of Trent, the twelve-year-old narrator of &#x201c;How We Eat&#x201d; by Mark Jude Poirier, is in its way as dangerous as Marwand&#x2019;s is in an Afghan village. Trent lives with his ten-year-old sister, Lizzie, and their mother, who insists they call her &#x201c;Brenda&#x201d; or &#x201c;Bren.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s a self-righteous, crazy woman with a hair-trigger temper, who wins arguments with her children by shifting ground. She routinely blames them for her every trouble. Brenda has trained Trent and Lizzie to find money for her, and when they do, she buys a small quantity of fast food for them to share unequally.<br><br>Trent tries to take care of Lizzie, who is still innocent enough to disobey Brenda. His love for Lizzie and his attempts to care for her lead Trent into trouble with Brenda but also gain him a painful chance to escape.<br><br>In Lara Vapnyar&#x2019;s funny and moving &#x201c;Deaf and Blind,&#x201d; the narrator views love, sex, and adult communication through the eyes of herself as a child.<br><br>Her mother&#x2019;s dear friend Olga visits Moscow as often as she can. The two women met when they were both undergoing treatment for infertility, which worked for the narrator&#x2019;s mother but not for Olga. Olga&#x2019;s husband, whom she doesn&#x2019;t love, remains crazy about her. The narrator&#x2019;s father leaves her mother, marries again, and becomes possessed by a new baby, neglecting the narrator. The situation is static until Olga falls in love with Sasha, a deaf and blind philosopher, who becomes an object of fascination for the narrator. She&#x2019;s learning about love in its eccentric and inconvenient possibilities, for, as her grandmother offers, &#x201c; &#x2018;We don&#x2019;t choose who we love.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Stacey, the narrator of Jenny Zhang&#x2019;s &#x201c;Why Were They Throwing Bricks?,&#x201d; is having problems with a different kind of love. For Stacey, and then for her younger brother, being loved by their grandmother is like being the object of a boa constrictor&#x2019;s affection. Their grandmother is used to getting her way and never gives up. Mixed with the story of Stacey&#x2019;s distancing of herself from her grandmother and her Chinese identity as she grows up in America is the story of her grandmother&#x2019;s own suffering. Unfortunately, that very real suffering doesn&#x2019;t make her grandmother any easier to love, though it makes Stacey&#x2014;and her story&#x2014;more nuanced and complex. The story&#x2019;s title evokes the grandm...</p><h2>Fifty Fifty (Harriet Blue, 2)</h2><p><b>Detective Harriet Blue is determined to clear a convicted killer's name . . . but when there's another murder, can she escape the madmen holding her hostage?</b><b><br></b>What are the chances that convicted killer Sam Blue is innocent of the serial murders of three young women?

Then everything changed. Peter opened his heart to the Scottish Fold kitten and their adventures to Paris, Fire Island, and in the subways of Manhattan took on the color of legend and mutual love. THE CAT WHO WENT TO PARIS proves that sometimes all it takes is paws and personality to change a life.</p><p><b>Peter Gethers&nbsp;</b>has spent almost a decade chronicling the life of his extraordinary cat. When he has some free time, he's also a novelist, publisher, and screenwriter. Under the pseudonym Russell Andrews, he has written the bestselling thrillers&nbsp;<i>Gideon&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Icarus</i>. He lives in New York City, Sag Harbor, and, luckily, Sicily.Foreword<br> &nbsp;<br> A few weeks ago, I made out my first-ever will. At thirty-six, it left me feeling slightly melancholy, more than slightly middle-aged, and somewhat sentimental. Looking to share my sentiment, I mentioned to my mother that I had&#x2014;quite magnanimously, I thought&#x2014;left my New York City apartment to my brother Eric&#x2019;s one-year-old son, Morgan. Instead of the expected motherly glow of affection and pride, she looked at me as if I were an insane person.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can you do that?!&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t understand her wide-eyed confusion, especially since, on the scale of human accomplishment, my mother ranks her small grandchild somewhere between Mahatma Gandhi, Thomas Jefferson, and Bo Jackson.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; I said, just a tad confused. &#x201c;I mean, I hope he doesn&#x2019;t get to use it for another forty or fifty years, but if he does, it&#x2019;ll go to Eric first and he can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you say Morgan?&#x201d; she interrupted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah. Who else?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought you said Norton,&#x201d; dear old Mom told me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My cat? You thought I left my apartment to my cat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, in a particularly wise moment, and shrugged, &#x201c;with Norton, you never know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Before the cat who went to Paris<br> &nbsp;<br> This is a book about an extraordinary cat. However, the extraordinary thing about any cat is the effect it has on its owner. Owning a cat, especially from kittenhood, is a lot like having a child. You feed him, do your best to educate him, talk to him as if he understands you&#x2014;and, in exchange, you want him to love you. He can drive you mad with his independence. He can, just as surely as a child, create a tremendous desire to protect him from anything bad. He is small, vulnerable, wonderful to hold&#x2014;when he lets you. And he throws up on just about the same regular schedule.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like children, cats exist on a separate and probably higher plane than we do, and like children, they must be at least partially defined by their relationship with their parents. And though they can do all sorts of amazing things such as hiding in the tiniest room imaginable and refusing to be found no matter how late you are for wherever it is you have to take them, they cannot write their autobiographies. That is left to humans. So this, as it must be, is also a book about people. And thus about relationships. And all sorts of other things cats have no business being involved with but can&#x2019;t seem to help themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> My involvement with a cat was strictly accidental. In fact, I had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming.<br> &nbsp;<br> By way of example, a little over seven years ago, someone asked me to name ten things that I believed were truly self-revealing, deeply heartfelt, and absolutely irrevocable. This person, a woman I was going out with, asked me to do this, I believe, because she thought I was a person without much emotion, without a lot of passion. She had, I also believe, been through way too many years of Upper East Side New York therapy in which she had made way too many lists like this. The fact of the matter was that I had plenty of emotion and plenty of passion. I just didn&#x2019;t have much for her. People often seem to fall into this trap in their relationships. They seem to feel that if someone doesn&#x2019;t do what he is expected to do, then there must be something wrong with him. This is a much easier way of getting through life, I suppose, than having to think there might be something wrong with the expectations or oneself or the world. Or life.<br> &nbsp;<br> I did, finally and over my better instincts, make a list of ten things I believed were true about myself. This is another trap that people fall into in their relationships (which cats never fall into): we do a lot of stupid things just so we don&#x2019;t have to be alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, this is the list that appeared:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will never vote Republican.<br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love does not usually hold up to close inspection<br> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... except for baseball. I love baseball&#x2014;watching it, listening to it on the radio, talking about it, reading box scores. I am a baseball junkie.<br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is basically a sad thing, with an even sadder ending, so anything that brightens up a moment along the way is okay. Especially if it&#x2019;s funny.<br> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t like being a part of anything&#x2014;a religion, a regular softball game, a corporation, a government, you name it. As soon as someone becomes something, I tend to think he or she is lost.<br> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friendship must be earned. It is too important to fritter away on someone who doesn&#x2019;t want it, won&#x2019;t reciprocate it, or isn&#x2019;t worthy of it. As near as I can tell, people don&#x2019;t have all that much inherent value, but friends sure do.<br> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#x2019;s very little cause for cruelty.<br> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, I&#x2019;ll pick entertaining and intelligent over nice any day of the week.<br> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t care what anyone says: I think Meryl Streep&#x2019;s a lousy actress.<br> 10.&nbsp; I hate cats.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the years that have passed, a few of these irrevocable items have actually remained steadfast. Several have been altered somewhat, some bordering on the brink of unrecognizability. And there is one of the above that is so ludicrous it now seems inconceivable that it ever crossed my mind, much less made it through my mouth or found its way onto paper.<br> &nbsp;<br> Numbers 1, 3, 6, and 7 remain absolutely unchanged.<br> &nbsp;<br> Number 4 is basically sound, although I cannot be nearly so definite about the word &#x201c;anything.&#x201d; There are terrifying things I did not conceive of when I made my initial list: oat bran, crack, People magazine cover stories on recovering alcoholic celebrities, wilding, sequels, and Abe Rosenthal&#x2019;s &#x201c;On My Mind&#x201d; column in the New York Times.<br> &nbsp;<br> Numbers 8 and 9 are a little tricky. 8 now depends more and more on my mood and how hard my day was. And Meryl Streep&#x2019;s Australian accent really is astonishing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Number 5 has changed somewhat. I have found something I am willing to join.<br> &nbsp;<br> Number 2 clearly relates to Number 5, which will become much clearer as this book continues, and they both, amazingly enough, have changed because of Number 10.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ah yes, Number 10 ...<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, now we&#x2019;ve come to the youthful folly, a statement made in such ignorance it boggles the mind ...<br> &nbsp;<br> I, of course, have a cat now. Norton.<br> &nbsp;<br> I treat this cat as very few animals&#x2014;or people, for that matter&#x2014;have ever been treated.<br> &nbsp;<br> If he is asleep in the middle of the bed when it&#x2019;s time for my day to end, I sleep curled up in a corner of the mattress, happily braving stiff necks and bad backs so he remains undisturbed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I take Norton everywhere I go. He&#x2019;s been skiing in Vermont, to a writers conference in San Diego, to the best restaurant in Amsterdam, back and forth on a regular basis to Paris. At one of that city&#x2019;s premier hotels, the Tremoille, when my assistant calls to make a reservation for Mr. Gethers, the desk clerk knows to ask: &#x201c;Avec son chat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I bought a house in Sag Harbor, a real-life Bedford Falls of a town near the tip of Long Island, and though there were many other mitigating circumstances, the secret and overriding reason for the purchase was because my cat loves to run around in a yard.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve had one girlfriend break up with me because she believed I liked Norton better than I liked her (which I did). And I once didn&#x2019;t go on a vacation with another girlfriend to my favorite resort hotel in America because they wouldn&#x2019;t accept small, very well-behaved felines.<br> &nbsp;<br> I worry about him, I talk about him (and to him, I have to add) to the point of idiocy, and if he doesn&#x2019;t sleep within a crooked arm&#x2019;s reach of my pillow&#x2014;which he doesn&#x2019;t about one day a week&#x2014;then I don&#x2019;t sleep very well. I actually worry that I&#x2019;ve done something to offend him.<br> &nbsp;<br> I sometimes&#x2014;and this is a particularly tough one to admit publicly&#x2014;let him eat off my spoon. Usually ice cream or yogurt. Chocolate&#x2019;s his favorite flavor, and it&#x2019;s a pretty funny thing to watch when he decides it&#x2019;s time to lick that sucker clean.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is hardly a one-way street, however. He does all sorts of things for me that are pretty wonderful for a cat.<br> &nbsp;<br> He goes for walks with me. No leash. On a beach with no cars around to disturb him, he&#x2019;s gone up to two miles, walking anywhere and everywhere from ten feet behind me to three feet in front of me. His record in traffic is three blocks, which he does most Sunday mornings when I stroll to Sean&#x2019;s Murray Hill market in Sag Harbor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Norton will wait for me anywhere, no matter where I leave him. If I&#x2019;m at a hotel, I can dump him outside by the pool or in the garden, and let him play there all day or night long. When I go to get him, he will be nowhere in sight, but when I call or whistle for him, he&#x2019;ll meow exactly once, then leap out of his hiding place to rush to join me.

But in this groundbreaking new book, Eric Toensmeier argues that agriculture&#x2015;specifically, the subset of practices known as &#x201c;carbon farming&#x201d;&#x2015;can, and should be, a linchpin of a global climate solutions platform.&nbsp;<br> <br> Carbon farming is a suite of agricultural practices and crops that sequester carbon in the soil and in above-ground biomass. Combined with a massive reduction in fossil fuel emissions&#x2015;and in concert with adaptation strategies to our changing environment&#x2015; carbon farming has the potential to bring us back from the brink of disaster and return our atmosphere to the &#x201c;magic number&#x201d; of 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide. Toensmeier&#x2019;s book is the first to bring together these powerful strategies in one place, including in-depth analysis of the available research and, where research is lacking, a discussion of what it will take to get us there.<br> <br> Carbon farming can take many forms. The simplest practices involve modifications to annual crop production. Although many of these modifications have relatively low sequestration potential, they are widely applicable and easily adopted, and thus have excellent potential to mitigate climate change if practiced on a global scale. Likewise, grazing systems such as silvopasture are easily replicable, don&#x2019;t require significant changes to human diet, and&#x2015;given the amount of agricultural land worldwide that is devoted to pasture&#x2015;can be important strategies in the carbon farming arsenal. But by far, agroforestry practices and perennial crops present the best opportunities for sequestration. While many of these systems are challenging to establish and manage, and would require us to change our diets to new and largely unfamiliar perennial crops, they also offer huge potential that has been almost entirely ignored by climate crusaders.&nbsp;<br> <br> Many of these carbon farming practices are already implemented globally on a scale of millions of hectares. These are not minor or marginal efforts, but win-win solutions that provide food, fodder, and feedstocks while fostering community self-reliance, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and repairing degraded land&#x2015;all while sequestering carbon, reducing emissions, and ultimately contributing to a climate that will remain amenable to human civilization. Just as importantly to a livable future, these crops and practices can contribute to broader social goals such as women&#x2019;s empowerment, food sovereignty, and climate justice.&nbsp;<br> <br> <em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em> does not present a prescription for how cropland should be used and is not, first and foremost, a how-to manual, although following up on references in a given section will frequently provide such information. Instead, <em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em> is&#x2015;at its root&#x2015;a toolkit. It is the most complete collection of climate-friendly crops and practices currently available. With this toolkit, farmers, communities, and governments large and small, can successfully launch carbon farming projects with the most appropriate crops and practices to their climate, locale, and socioeconomic needs.&nbsp;<br> <br> Toensmeier&#x2019;s ultimate goal is to place carbon farming firmly in the center of the climate solutions platform, alongside clean solar and wind energy. With <em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em>, Toensmeier wants to change the discussion, impact policy decisions, and steer mitigation funds to the research, projects, and people around the world who envision a future where agriculture becomes the protagonist in this fraught, urgent, and unprecedented drama of our time. Citizens, farmers, and funders will be inspired to use the tools presented in this important new book to transform degraded lands around the world into productive carbon-storing landscapes.</p></p><p><p>Eric Toensmeier is the award-winning author of <em>Paradise Lot</em> and <em>Perennial Vegetables</em>, and the co-author of <em>Edible Forest Gardens</em>.

Toensmeier is an&nbsp;applied ecologist with extensive experience in the Latin American tropics, and practices&nbsp;these principles in workshops, books, and at home. More than a reference volume, <em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em>&nbsp;is an easily read and interesting overview of this important&nbsp;frontier. ...&nbsp;The appendixes to the book provide a&nbsp;wealth of data on species and relevant references that could keep anyone truly interested&nbsp;&nbsp;engaged for months in following up on sources and designing&nbsp;new systems based on&nbsp;these ideas.&nbsp;<em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em> is indeed a monumental project that will help guide tropical agricultural development for decades, and Toensmeier has provided a significant resource for those concerned about climate and the future.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Choice</em></strong><strong>-</strong></p> <p>"The terrestrial carbon pool is one of the most dynamic because it is directly affected by how people manage soils and implement cropping systems. The renewed interest in sequestering carbon into the soil reservoir creates a series of questions on how to introduce practices that are effective in increasing soil carbon along with providing plant resources to sustain the goods and services needed for a healthy ecosystem. In this volume, Toensmeier (Yale Univ.), co-author with David Jacke of&nbsp;<em>Edible Forest Gardens,&nbsp;</em>(v. 1)&nbsp;(CH, Jan'06, 43-2794),&nbsp;explores the carbon sequestration potential of different agroecological systems. He directly compares these systems, revealing the limitations of each and placing their dynamics in perspective. These include annual versus perennial systems and grasses and crops versus trees. As the subtitle indicates, the book uses a toolkit approach to help readers understand the value of selecting different practices and species appropriate to a given ecosystem. Included in the analysis of mitigation strategies are livestock systems and ways these can be managed in concert with plant systems to create viable agroecosystems to reduce the carbon footprint in agriculture.&nbsp;<strong>Summing Up: Recommended. All library collections.</strong>&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"To minimize climate change, environmental engineers have recently proposed several innovative, if controversial, schemes designed to soak up CO2 or even block sunlight altogether, including spraying aerosols in the upper atmosphere. Yet, according to permaculture expert Toensmeier, a more reliable and safer solution involves trading in conventional agriculture practices for a soil-management methodology known as carbon farming. In this weighty but well-organized handbook, Toensmeier offers a wealth of guidance on cutting-edge farming techniques that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and capture carbon in vegetation and soils. As a successful model of what&#x2019;s possible, Toensmeier cites Las Canadas, in Veracruz, Mexico, where food-cooperative owner Ricardo Romero restored 250 acres of degraded farmland within 10 years. In 5 lucidly written sections, Toensmeier covers the science of carbon sequestration, perennial crop cultivation, and key financing tips. On the coattails of the recent, successful Paris Climate Summit, Toensmeier provides invaluable information and inspiration to farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs as well as everyone interested in environmentally positive farming as part of the effort to protect food sources and mitigate global warming.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Library Journal</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Toensmeier (<em>Perennial Vegetables</em>) contends that shifting agricultural practices can help mitigate climate change and advocates for carbon farming, i.e., using a suite of perennial crops and practices that simultaneously seclude carbon in the soil while maintaining the amounts of crops needed globally for food, materials, and energy. The author delineates the different types of systems that are best at sequestering carbon and also provides strategies for livestock management, supplying general information on practices such as rainwater harvesting and terrace farming that will help guarantee the successful implementation of this type of farming. A large section is devoted to perennial crops that Toensmeier maintains would be strong candidates for carbon farming.&nbsp;<strong>VERDICT:</strong>&nbsp;Both small- and large-scale farmers will find ways to apply methods that segregate carbon and therefore lessen the deleterious effects of climate change in this comprehensive title.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Agriculture is currently a major net producer of greenhouse gases, with little prospect of improvement unless things change markedly. In&nbsp;<em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em>, Eric Toensmeier puts carbon sequestration at the forefront and shows how agriculture can be a net absorber of carbon. Improved forms of annual-based agriculture can help to a degree; however to maximize carbon sequestration, it is perennial crops we must look at, whether it be perennial grains, other perennial staples, or agroforestry systems incorporating trees and other crops. In this impressive book, backed up with numerous tables and references, the author has assembled a toolkit that will be of great use to anybody involved in agriculture whether in the tropics or colder northern regions. For me the highlights are the chapters covering perennial crop species organized by use&#x2015;staple crops, protein crops, oil crops, industrial crops, etc.&#x2015;with some seven hundred species described. There are crops here for all climate types, with good information on cultivation and yields, so that wherever you are, you will be able to find suitable recommended perennial crops. This is an excellent book that gives great hope without being na�ve and makes a clear reasoned argument for a more perennial-based agriculture to both feed people and take carbon out of the air.&#x201d;<strong>--Martin Crawford, director, The Agroforestry Research Trust; author of&nbsp;<em>Creating a Forest Garden</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Trees for Gardens, Orchards, and Permaculture&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Scientific observations and models are building an increasingly dire picture of the obstacles that must be crossed on the road to achieving climate and ecological health and stability on a planet&nbsp;filled with humans.&nbsp;The relentlessly hopeful (but not naively optimistic) author of&nbsp;<em>The Carbon Farming Solution</em>&nbsp;reminds us that&nbsp;our planet is still rich in biological resources and that humanity is capable of astonishing feats of creativity and collaborative action; the picture painted here in word and image depicts&nbsp;both the barriers and paths through them. Eric Toensmeier draws upon both the scientific literature and the world&#x2019;s ethnobotanical knowledge bank to construct a logical and compelling road map for future research and investment to reinvent agriculture.

It had a major influence on Enlightenment thinkers and the development of the modern world. In Ethics, Spinoza addresses the most fundamental perennial philosophical questions concerning the nature of God, human beings and a good life. His startling answers synthesize the longstanding traditions of ancient Greek and Jewish philosophy with the developments of the emerging scientific revolution. The resulting philosophical system casts out the willing, personal God of Abrahamic religions and takes up the challenge of reconceiving the natural world and human beings in an entirely secular way. This volume offers a new translation based on a new critical edition, reflecting the state of the art in Spinoza scholarship, and also includes an introduction, chronology and glossary to help make this notoriously difficult text accessible.</p><p>Spinoza&#39;s Ethics is one of the most historically and philosophically significant texts of the early modern period.

Any parent with more than one child is probably well aware of how different from each other children, even siblings, can be. So it&#39;s only natural that the parenting strategies that work with one child may be less effective with another child. How can you be sure that your nurturing is well suited to your child? With this one-of-a-kind parenting guide, you can use Personality Type analysis - a powerful and well-respected psychological tool - to understand your child better and become a more effective parent. In Nurture by Nature you&#39;ll learn which of 16 distinctly different types best matches your child&#39;s personality; how this personality type affects your child in each of the three stages of development - preschool, school age, and adolescence; how other parents, whose experiences are recounted in scores of case studies, deal with a wide array of challenging situations you may encounter: reining in a preschooler whose boundless energy constantly gets him into trouble; communicating with a child who keeps her thoughts and feelings secret; understanding an adolescent who seems not to care that he is forever losing things (his homework, his baseball cap, his keys); broadening the horizons of a child who resists trying anything new or unfamiliar...; and how you can adapt your parenting style to your child&#39;s type - and get better results when communicating, supporting, motivating, and disciplining. Whether your child is a tantrum-prone toddler, a shy third-grader, a rebellious teen, or somewhere in between, Nurture by Nature will give you the power to understand why children are the way they are - and to become the best parent you can be.</p><p>Personality-type assessment helps parents learn about a child's individuality. Armed with knowledge of that individuality, parents can add understanding and acceptance to their unconditional love, gear their parenting to the needs of the child, and help the child develop lasting self-esteem and happiness. According to Myers and Briggs, inventors of the personality inventory scales that bear their names, there are 16 types of personality, each of which is characterized by preferences in interpersonal interaction, sorts of information noticed and remembered, methods of decision making, and degrees of structure found desirable. Tieger and Barron-Tieger offer detailed interpretations of each of the Myers-Briggs types as they flesh out personality assessment as a valuable parenting resource, stressing that how valuable will depend quite heavily on specific parents' insights, perceptiveness, and imagination. Some prior familiarity with personality-type assessment will help in making the best use of their advice, yet this remains a remarkable tool for relating to children. <i>Kathryn Carpenter</i></p><h2>Wampeters, Foma &amp; Granfalloons: (Opinions)</h2><p><p><i>Wampeters, Foma &amp; Granfalloons</i>&nbsp;is a rare opportunity to experience Kurt Vonnegut speaking in his own voice about his own life, his views of the world, his writing, and the writing of others.

A wampeter is an object around which the lives of many otherwise unrelated people may revolve. The Holy Grail would be a case in point. Foma are harmless untruths, intended to comfort simple souls. An example: "Prosperity is just around the corner." A granfalloon is a proud and meaningless association of human beings. Taken together, the words form as good an umbrella as any for this collection of some of the reviews and essays I have written, a few of the speeches I have made. Most of my speeches were never written down.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I used to make speeches all the time. I needed the applause. I needed the easy money. And then, while I was doing my regular routine of Hoosier shit-kicking on the stage of the Library of Congress, a circuit breaker in my head snapped out. I had nothing more to say. That was the end of my speaking career. I spoke a few times after that, but I was no longer the glib Philosopher of the Prairies it had once been so easy for me to be.<br><br>The proximate cause of my mind's shutting off in Washington was a question from the floor. The middle-aged man who asked it appeared to me to be a recent refugee from Middle Europe. "You are a leader of American young people," he said. "What right do you have to teach them to be so cynical and pessimistic?"<br><br>I was not a leader of American young people. I was a writer who should have been home and writing, rather than seeking easy money and applause.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I can name several good American writers who have become wonderful public speakers, who now find it hard to concentrate while they are merely writing. They miss the applause.<br><br>I do think, though, that public speaking is almost the only way a poet or a novelist or a playwright can have any political effectiveness in his creative prime. If he tries to put his politics into a work of the imagination, he will foul up his work beyond all recognition.<br><br>. . . <br><br>Among the many queer things about the American economy is this: A writer can get more money for a bungling speech at a bankrupt college than he can get for a short-story masterpiece. What's more, he can sell the speech over and over again, and no one complains.<br><br>. . . <br><br>People complain so rarely about bad speeches, even speeches costing a thousand dollars and more. That I have wondered if anybody really hears them. And I received an interesting opinion on how people listen to them right before my speech to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters, which is in this book.<br><br>I was seasick with dread before I gave the speech. I was seated between a famous old architect, and the president of the Academy. We were three skinny, blank-faced human beings, in full view of the audience. We spoke as convicts in motion pictures to, when planning a break under the eyes of guards.<br><br>I told the architect how frightened I was. I expected him to comfort me. But he replied pitilessly, and in a voice the president could hear, that the president had read my speech and detested it.<br><br>I asked the president if this was so.<br><br>"Yes," he said. "But don't worry about it."<br><br>I reminded him that I still had to deliver the detestable speech.<br><br>"Nobody is going to listen to what you say," he assured me. "People are seldom interested in the actual content of a speech. They simply want to learn from your tone and gestures and expressions whether or not you are an honest man."<br><br>"Thank you," I said.<br><br>"I will bring the meeting to order," he said. And he did. And I spoke.<br><br>. . . <br><br>In this miracle age of organ transplants and other forms of therapeutic vivisection, it would be wrong of me to protest my being dissected while still alive. Two nice young college professors, Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, and John Somer of Kansas State Teachers College, are doing just that to me. They have published one seemingly posthumous volume, The Vonnegut Statement, a collection of essays about me. And they proposed to do another: a collection of everything I had ever written and which had never been put between hard covers before.<br><br>They presented my publisher with an appallingly complete bibliography. I keep no records of my work, and had been delighted to forget a lot of it. Klinkowitz and Somer refreshed my memory with their rap sheet. Their intentions were friendly. They thought of themselves as archaeologists, unearthing primitive artifacts which might help to explain whatever it is I have become. But some of the ugliest artifacts were actually of very recent origin. When I examined all the crap indubitably associated with my body, I did not feel like the ghost of Tutankhamen. I felt like a person who was creepily alive, still, and justly accused of petty crimes.<br><br>. . . <br><br>From all that crap, I have called this volume. I would not have been able to do it without the help of Klinkowitz and Somer, who knew where almost all the bodies were hidden. There are only three or four works of mine they know nothing about. Not even the ordeal of the veglia, said to be the most excruciating torture ever devised by Earthlings, could compel me to reveal where those three or four were published--and when.<br><br>This is not a book of my laundry lists, so to speak. I am pleased to have most of this stuff preserved. There are several short stories which have never been collected. I am content to leave them that way, except for one, Fortitude, a screenplay for an unproduced short science-fiction film. That is the only fiction in this book.<br><br>Everything else in here shows me trying to tell the truth nakedly, without the ornaments of fiction, about this or that. Which brings us to a discussion of the place of the "New Journalism," as opposed to fiction, in the literature of modern times.<br><br>. . . <br><br>Thucydides is the first New Journalist I know anything about. He was a celebrity who put himself at the center of the truths he was trying to tell, and he guessed when he had to, and he thought it worthwhile to be charming and entertaining. He was a good teacher. He did not wish to put his students to sleep with the truth, and he meant to put the truth into strikingly human terms, so his students would remember.<br><br>He is to be admired for his usefulness and good citizenship, and so is anybody who writes or teaches that way today. I am crazy about Hunter Thompson, for instance, on the account, and I say so in a review I have included in this book.<br><br>Am I a New Journalist? I guess. There's some New Journalism in here--about Biafra, about the Republican Convention of 1972. It's loose and personal.<br><br>But I am not tempted to do much more of that sort of stuff. I have wavered some on this, but I am now persuaded again that acknowledged fiction is a much more truthful way of telling the truth than the New Journalism is. Or, to put it another way, the very finest New Journalism is fiction. In either art form, we have an idiosyncratic reporter. The New Journalist isn't free to tell nearly as much as a fiction writer, to show as much. There are many places he can't take his reader, whereas the fiction writer can take the reader anywhere, including the planet Jupiter, in case there's something worth seeing there.<br><br>In either case, the principal issue, as I learned at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, is whether or not the person who is trying to tell the truth gives the impression of being an honest man.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I am reminded now, as I think about news and fiction, of a demonstration of the difference between noise and melody which I saw and heard in freshman physics lecture at Cornell University so long ago. (Freshman physics is invariably the most satisfying course offered by any American university.) The professor threw a narrow board, which was about the length of a bayonet, at the wall of the room, which was cinder block. "That's noise," he said.<br><br>Then he picked up seven more boards, and he threw them against the wall in rapid succession, as though he were a knife-thrower. The boards in sequence sang the opening notes of "Mary Had a Little Lamb." I was enchanted.<br><br>"That's melody," he said.<br><br>And fiction is melody, and journalism, new or old, is noise.<br><br>. . . <br><br>He gave a lecture on equilibrium, too. He stood behind a twenty-foot row of waist-high cabinets in front of the room. He had a string tied to his finger. And, as he said this and that about equilibrium, he appeared to be playing with a yo-yo, which we couldn't see because of the cabinets.<br><br>He kept that up for the better part of an hour. At last he raised his arm so we could see what was on the other end of the string. It was a piece of wood molding twenty-feet long, with the string tied to its midpoint.<br><br>"That," he said, "is equilibrium."<br><br>I keep losing and regaining my equilibrium, which is the basic plot of all popular fiction. And I myself am a work of fiction. I remember I was with the theatrical producer Hilly Elkins one time. He had just bought the film rights to Cat's Cradle, and I was attempting to become urbane. I made some urbane remarks, and Hilly shook his head, and he said, "No, no, no. No, no. Go for Will Rogers, not for Cary Grant."<br><br>. . . <br><br>I happen to have my equilibrium just now. I received a note from a twelve-year-old this morning. He had read my latest novel, Breakfast of Champions, and he said, "Dear Mr. Vonnegut: Please don't commit suicide." God love him. I have told him I am fine.<br><br>This book is dedicated to a person who helped me to regain my equilibrium. I say she cronkled me. That is another coined word. She came to me with an expressed wish to "chronicle" my wonderful life from day to day on photographic film. What eventuated was much deeper than mere chronicling.<br><br>. . . <br><br>The Playboy Interview with me in this book is almost as fictitious as my fleeting imitation of Cary Grant. It is what I should have said, not what I really said. Playboy showed me a typescript of what I had said into their tape recorder, and it was obvious to me that I had at least one thing in common with Joseph Conrad: English was my second language. Unlike Conrad: English was my second language. Unlike Conrad, I had no first language, so I went to work on the transcript with pen and pencil and scissors and paste, to make it appear that speaking my native tongue and thinking about important matters came very easily to me.<br><br>This is what I find most encouraging about the writing trades: They allow mediocre people who are patient and industrious to revise their stupidity, to edit themselves into something like intelligence, they also allow lunatics to seem saner than sane.<br><br>. . . <br><br>Here is my understanding of the Universe and mankind's place in it at the present time:<br><br>The seeming curvature of the Universe is an illusion. The Universe is really as straight as a string, except for a loop at either end. The loops are microscopic.<br><br>One tip of the string is forever vanishing. Its neighboring loop is forever retreating from extinction. The other end is forever growing. Its neighboring loop is forever pursuing Genesis.<br><br>In the beginning and in the end was Nothingness. Nothingness implied the possibility of Somethingness. It is impossible to make something from nothing. Therefore, Nothingness could only imply Somethingness.

A quarrelsome priest joins him, and in rain and sleet they dig up the Albanian countryside once a battlefield, now a graveyard checking teeth and dog tags, assembling a dead army in pine-box uniforms. In addition to the brutal weather, they also battle the hostility of the Albanians working for them. This may be an errand of mercy for the general, but the chance to humiliate their one-time conquerors offers the Albanians a welcome vengeance. Fighting the hopelessness of his undertaking, the general finds his movements shadowed by a German general on the same gruesome mission for his own country. In a terrible crescendo at a wedding, the Italian general must answer for the crimes of his country and all countries that have invaded this land of eagles, seeking to destroy its people.

To earn this special role, we prepare for many years. In college, we study the basic sciences: biology, chemistry, physics, and others. We move on to medical school for the clinically relevant sciences, including anatomy, biochemistry, pathology, physiology, microbiology, and more. Outside the lecture halls and labs, we shadow senior physicians on clinical rotations through all the medical specialties: internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry, family medicine, neurology. But we're still not finished. After choosing a field for our careers, we undertake a grueling apprenticeship called internship and residency that lasts several years, and we often follow that with further subspecialty training in a fellowship.</p> <p>After all those years learning and training, digesting thousands of textbook pages and medical journal articles, listening to hundreds of lectures, and encountering countless real patients with real diseases and injuries, it would be reasonable to assume doctors understand just about everything there is to understand about the workings of the human body. Yet, in the daily practice of medicine, physicians are often surprised. Two patients with the same diagnosis each have nuances that distinguish them. Illnesses that are usually predictable take unexpected twists and turns. Treatments have unanticipated consequences. Patients and their families amaze us with seemingly impossible inner fortitude and resilience in the face of tragedy and grief. Physicians are accustomed to expect the unexpected, and we are usually well-prepared to respond.</p> <p>But occasionally in the course of caring for our patients, we encounter events that truly stun us: unforgettable occurrences that defy all of our predictions and expectations, far exceeding the wide berth we are trained to allow for surprise. These are events for which there is no clear medical or psychological explanation, or if there is, the explanation itself is extraordinary. When these occur, we are rarely alone in our awe; medicine is a collaborative endeavor, so during these truly confounding and mysterious episodes, we seek advice and consultation from colleagues, specialists, and mentors. And when they, too, are at a loss to explain what we are seeing, the experience often deeply impacts everyone involved.</p> <p>This book tells the stories of medical 'miracles' in the words of leading doctors who witnessed them, physicians at the top of their fields. Contributors to this book include pediatricians, internists, surgeons, family medicine specialists, emergency medicine physicians, obstetricians, psychiatrists, and subspecialists in a wide variety of fields. They include leaders in the bedside care of individual patients, as well as in global health care where entire populations are affected. Among our essayists are dozens of preeminent educators, including deans and department heads, on the faculties of the top university medical schools in the country. All of our essayists also care for patients, spanning the broad clinical spectrum from community practitioners to highly specialized experts at major medical centers. The common thread among us is that we have borne witness to unexplainable, unforgettable, and profoundly unexpected events&#x2015;medical miracles&#x2015;in our patients.</p> <p>These are not miracles resulting solely from heroic or high-tech medical interventions, situations for which we have a good explanation for the outcome&#x2015;thoughtful, caring, and talented medical personnel applying state-of-the-art technology to save lives. Rather, the stories in this book are of patients whose outcomes amazed their doctors and nurses, perhaps despite their heroic efforts, because of the seeming impossibility of the events that took place. The stories recount spectacular serendipities, impossible cures, breathtaking resuscitations, extraordinary awakenings, and recovery from unimaginable disasters. Still other essays tell of physicians' experiences in which the miracle was more emotional than physical, yet also left a lasting imprint. Doctors sharing in gut-wrenching decisions made by patients and families, and then in the resulting joy&#x2015;or heartbreak. Discovering a silver lining of forgiveness or resilience, a child's wisdom or a family's generosity of spirit, evoked salvation and triumph in the face of sadness and tragedy. Over the course of a career, these emotionally stunning events occur more frequently than, for example, a patient 'coming back to life' or recovering from a terminal disease after all hope had been lost, yet they are no less inspirational, no less miraculous to those witnessing them. As my colleague and friend Dr. Kevin Kalikow commented, it's those essays that truly illustrate the difference between 'curing' and 'healing.'</p> <p>The first medical miracle I witnessed was as a pediatrics resident-in-training. Two young brothers, ages three and seven, were brought into the emergency room and then the intensive care unit after near-drowning episodes. The recovery of one of the brothers was so unlikely, so astounding, that I was forever imprinted by the experience. This was not the last miracle I would see in my thirty-plus years as a pediatrics specialist. Many of my colleagues would agree that, despite being at the forefront of medicine and science, what we don't understand often exceeds what we do understand. And even when we think we understand, we are frequently proven wrong.</p> <p>The word 'miracle' is often used in religious contexts, and while faith and prayer certainly play an important role in many of our patients' lives, as well as in some of the vignettes in this compilation, this is not a book about religion. I will leave it to the reader to determine what, if any, role those factors play in the outcome of these stories. Rather, this is a book about optimism and inspiration, and the realization that what we don't know or don't understand isn't necessarily cause for fear, and can even be reason for hope.</p> <p>The experience of inviting physicians to contribute essays to this collection has, in and of itself, been enlightening for me. There have been three general categories of responses, all very thoughtful in their own way. Some colleagues knew right away that they hadn't had 'miraculous experiences,' and politely thanked me for asking. A second group said, 'Nothing comes to mind right away, but I'll keep thinking on it and try to come up with something.' With only a few exceptions, those physicians didn't have a belated epiphany despite pondering it. The third group of responses was most exciting for me. These colleagues immediately replied with, 'Oh my goodness! I have an amazing story I've been waiting for the chance to tell.' Not all of us are fortunate enough to encounter unexplained, unexpected, deeply moving and mysterious moments in medicine. But when a medical miracle&#x2015;physical, emotional, or both&#x2015;does occur in a physician's career, it's unforgettable, in the forefront of our minds, and ripe for telling. In the telling of the inspirational stories that fill this book, we learn as much about the physicians as about their patients. My editor at HCI Books, Christine Belleris, said it beautifully: Emerging through all of the moving personal testimonials from physicians in this collection is a compelling glimpse into the lives and souls of doctors&#x2015;their compassion, humanity, and determined devotion to their patients and their patients' families. </p> <p>The other striking observation for me regarding the essays is how many of the events occurred decades earlier&#x2015;often in the early stages of a physician's training or practice. This is another testament to the powerful impact these experiences have on those witnessing them&#x2015;unforgettable, still affecting physicians' personal and professional lives. In these decades-old cases, the essayist-physician often recalls the concomitant astonished reactions of his or her senior and supervising physicians, expressed on rounds and in case conferences. It was the astonishment of the senior physicians, highly trained specialists and experienced mentors, as much as the amazement felt by the young physicians, that kept those memories alive all these years. In many cases, physicians describing events occurring years ago noted that those early memories served to give them hope as they encountered new, seemingly hopeless cases in subsequent years. Some contributors wrote that the miracle experience actually directed them in their choice of specialty and has influenced much of their professional decision-making throughout their careers. Others draw on those miraculous moments at times when they themselves feel helpless in the face of adversity and tragedy. Powerful stuff.</p> <p>Another unexpected and quite magical outgrowth of this project has been the reconnections that some of the physician-essayists have now made with the patients and patients' families with whom they shared the miracle years earlier. Either in the course of tracking down the individuals for permission to tell their story, or simply reaching out to learn what has become of them, writing these essays has renewed old bonds. These reconnections have been moving and gratifying for everyone involved&#x2015;including me, when I've been privileged to be included in the conversation.</p> <p>Finally, three especially noteworthy responses to my invitation to submit an essay deserve special mention:</p> <p>Several colleagues responded by saying that their memories of patients whose outcomes were unexpectedly bad are more vivid and haunting than those with miraculously good outcomes. That is only natural&#x2015;we all relive and replay the horrible stories, asking ourselves, What went wrong? and What more could I have done? We must accept the inevitability of bad things occasionally happening to our patients over which we have no more control than we do over mystifyingly good outcomes like some of those described in this book. And among other essays herein, particularly those in the 'Silver Linings' chapter, a mix of good and bad can occur with potent outcomes. Over the course of our careers, we can only hope that the positive results outweigh the negative, sustaining us in the good works we hope to accomplish.</p> <p>Two essay contributors asked me to caution readers that patients' dependence on miracles can be detrimental. While retaining hope in seemingly hopeless situations is emotionally and sometimes even physically healing, hope alone will not cure disease. When proven medical treatments are avail-able and beneficial, but declined in favor of waiting for a miracle, the patient will likely be disappointed. The takeaway message from the essays in this book cannot be to rely solely on a bolt of lightning from above. I received no essays for this collection of miraculous outcomes describing patients who refused proven medical therapy. My grandfather used to tell a joke about the saintly but impoverished old man who prayed and prayed and prayed to win the lottery so he could live a better life in his last years. After years of having his prayers unfulfilled, he finally threw up his hands and asked, 'Dear Lord, I have been a good servant for many years, doing good for others while sacrificing my own needs. Why haven't you granted my wish to win the lottery?' In a booming voice from heaven, the response came, 'My son, you have to buy a ticket!' Hoping for the best outcome possible in a time of medical crisis is natural and uplifting, but you have to buy a ticket&#x2015;if established and effective therapies are available, don't ignore them while waiting for a miracle.</p> <p>And in the third notable response to my invitation, two colleagues expressed nearly identical sentiments, quoted here with their permission. Although neither had a singularly 'miraculous' patient experience to relate, Nathan Rabinovitch, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said, 'Doing what we do as doctors, and seeing all that can go wrong, I've come to appreciate that every healthy day is a miracle.' And Allan Gibofsky, Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, answered, 'The longer I live, the more convinced I am that every breath, every heartbeat (and yes, even every bowel movement) is itself a miracle. We spend so much of our professional lives as doctors dealing with what is wrong in our patients (and ourselves), that I fear we have become inured to appreciating all that goes right.' Amen to both of them.</p> <p>Thank you for giving audience to the stories we've been waiting to tell about the miracles we've been so fortunate to see.</p> <p>&#x2015;Harley A.

Ancrum</b> grew up in Chicago Illinois, under the illusory rigor of the Chicago Public School system. She attended Dominican University to study Fashion Merchandizing, but was lured into getting an English degree after spending too many nights experimenting with hard literary criticism and hanging out with unsavory types, like poetry students. Currently, she lives in Andersonville and writes books at work when no one is looking. <i>The Wicker King</i> is her first novel.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;An intense and disturbing book that is reluctant reader&#x2014;friendly flash fiction and packs a punch despite its brevity. August and Jack have been like brothers from the beginning: their mothers are best friends, and the boys were practically raised together. Jack, always the leader with a vivid imagination, brought the willing August into his world of make-believe where Jack was king and August his faithful knight. That relationship has endured into high school, where they rely on each other for the support their dysfunctional families can't provide. When Jack begins seeing images from an alternate reality intruding on his everyday life, August knows that his friend needs help. But August believes he owes Jack, who once saved him from drowning, and thinks this could be the opportunity to repay that life debt. Jack is adamant that, to escape his visions, he must complete a quest, but his last task depends on August's help. August is once again drawn into Jack's fantasy world, risking his life to do his friend's bidding. At first, their final blazing act of glory appears a success&#x2014;but Jack's visions fail to vanish, and both of them are separated and imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital where August's mental stability may be more in question than Jack's. Like Libba Bray's Going Bovine, Ancrum delves into the blurry space between reality and madness. Short chapters are interspersed with artwork, photos, and scanned images. VERDICT A haunting and provocative read that will keep teens riveted. A strong choice for most YA shelves.&#x2014;Cary Frostick, formerly at Mary Riley Styles Public Library, Falls Church, VA</p><h2>Paris in Disguise (Alex Kovacs thriller series)</h2><p>Paris is cold and hungry. The Germans are in the fourth year of their occupation, and while a Resistance movement flourishes, it is small and perilous beyond belief. The lives of Resistance radio operators can be measured in weeks, not months &#x2014; such is the mortal danger. But are they being caught by Nazi efficiency or by betrayal?Alex Kovacs is a part of one of those Resistance cells, a jack-of-all-covert-trades, sometimes a courier of information, other times a guide for new agents, always a committed member of the Resistance movement whose eyes are nonetheless open to its flaws. When several of his fellow agents are caught in rapid succession by the Germans, concern grows that there is a traitor within the cell. And when an outlandish plan to unmask the traitor is proposed, Alex agrees to take on a new identity and a grand lifestyle in order to infiltrate the highest levels of the Gestapo&#x2019;s murderous operation.Paris in Disguise is the fifth book in the Alex Kovacs historical espionage thriller series. If you like the world inhabited by Philip Kerr&#x2019;s Bernie Gunther or the characters created by Alan Furst, a place and time of unfathomable evil where the biggest questions sometimes are forced upon the most ordinary of people, then you&#x2019;ll love Richard Wake&#x2019;s new World War II thriller.Pick up Paris in Disguise to travel along on Alex&#x2019;s latest adventure!</p><p></p><h2>Mitch and Amy</h2><p><strong> Double Trouble</strong> <p>Mitch and Amy both think being twins is fun, but that doesn't stop them from squabbling.

That honor belongs to Meg, who is married to Jack, and they are the perfect parents of two perfect children, a boy and a girl, blond and blue-eyed and sweeter than honey cakes. Meg is pregnant again and I couldn&#x2019;t be more excited because I&#x2019;m having a baby too.<br> <br>Leaning my forehead against the glass, I look in both directions along the pavement, past the greengrocer and hairdressing salon and fashion boutique. Meg is running late. Normally she has dropped Lucy at primary school and Lachlan at his preschool by now and has joined her friends at the caf� on the corner. Her mothers&#x2019; group meets every Friday morning, sitting at an outdoor table, jostling prams into place like eighteen-wheelers on the vehicle deck of a ferry. One skinny cappuccino, one chai latte, and a pot of herbal tea . . .<br> <br>A red bus goes past and blocks my view of Barnes Green, which is opposite. When it pulls away again I see Meg on the far side of the road. She&#x2019;s dressed in her stretch jeans and a baggy sweater, and carrying a colorful three-wheeled scooter. Lachlan must have insisted on riding to his preschool, which would have slowed her down. He will also have stopped to look at the ducks and at the exercise class and at the old people doing tai chi who move so slowly they could almost be stop-motion puppets.<br> <br>Meg doesn&#x2019;t appear pregnant from this angle. It&#x2019;s only when she turns side-on that the bump becomes a basketball, neat and round, getting lower by the day. I heard her complaining last week about swollen ankles and a sore back. I know how she feels. My extra pounds have turned climbing stairs into a workout and my bladder is the size of a walnut.<br> <br>Glancing both ways, she crosses Church Road and mouths the word &#x201c;sorry&#x201d; to her friends, double-kissing their cheeks and cooing at their babies. All babies are cute, people say, and I guess that&#x2019;s true. I have peered into prams at Gollum-like creatures with sticky-out eyes and two strands of hair, yet always found something to love because they&#x2019;re so newly minted and innocent.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m supposed to be stocking the shelves in aisle three. This part of the supermarket is usually a safe place to slack off, because the manager, Mr. Patel, has a problem with feminine hygiene products. He won&#x2019;t use words like &#x201c;tampons&#x201d; or &#x201c;sanitary pads&#x201d;&#x2014;calling them &#x201c;ladies&#x2019; things&#x201d; or simply pointing to the boxes that he wants unpacked.<br> <br>I work four days a week, early morning to three, unless one of the other part-timers calls in sick. Mostly I stock shelves and sticker prices. Mr. Patel won&#x2019;t let me work the cash register because he says I break things. That happened one time and it wasn&#x2019;t my fault.<br> <br>With a name like Mr. Patel, I thought he&#x2019;d be Pakistani or Indian, but he turned out to be Welsher than a daffodil, with a shock of red hair and a truncated mustache that makes him look like Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s ginger love child.<br> <br>Mr. Patel doesn&#x2019;t like me very much and he&#x2019;s been itching to get rid of me ever since I told him I was pregnant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t expect any maternity leave&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not full-time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect any.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And doctor&#x2019;s appointments are on your own time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if you can&#x2019;t lift boxes you&#x2019;ll have to stop working.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can lift boxes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Patel has a wife and four kids at home, but it hasn&#x2019;t made him any more sympathetic to my pregnancy. I don&#x2019;t think he likes women very much. I don&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;s gay. When I first started working at the supermarket he was all over me like a rash&#x2014;finding any excuse to brush up against me in the storeroom or when I was mopping the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oops!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, pressing his hard-on against my buttocks. &#x201c;Just parking my bike.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pervert!<br> <br>I go back to my stock cart and pick up the price gun, careful to check the settings. Last week I put the wrong price on the canned peaches and Mr. Patel docked me eight quid.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; barks a voice. Mr. Patel has crept up behind me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Restocking the tampons,&#x201d; I stutter.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were staring out the window. Your forehead made that greasy mark on the glass.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Mr. Patel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I pay you to daydream?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d; I point to the shelf. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re out of the Tampax Super Plus&#x2014;the one with the applicator.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Patel looks queasy. &#x201c;Well, look in the storeroom.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s backing away. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a spill in aisle two. Mop it up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Patel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you can go home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m working until three.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Devyani will cover for you. She can climb the stepladder.&#x201d;<br> <br>What he means is that she&#x2019;s not pregnant or afraid of heights, and that she&#x2019;ll let him &#x201c;park his bike&#x201d; without going all feminist on his arse. I should sue him for sexual harassment, but I like this job. It gives me an excuse to be in Barnes and nearer to Meg.<br> <br>In the rear storeroom I fill a bucket with hot soapy water and choose a sponge mop that hasn&#x2019;t worn away to the metal frame. Aisle two is closer to the registers. I get a good view of the caf� and the outside tables. I take my time cleaning the floor, staying clear of Mr. Patel. Meg and her friends are finishing up. Cheeks are kissed. Phones are checked. Babies are strapped into prams and pushchairs. Meg makes some final remark and laughs, tossing her fair hair. Almost unconsciously, I toss mine. It doesn&#x2019;t work. That&#x2019;s the problem with curls&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t toss, they bounce.<br> <br>Meg&#x2019;s hairdresser, Jonathan, warned me that I couldn&#x2019;t get away with the same cut that she has, but I wouldn&#x2019;t listen to him.<br> <br>Meg is standing outside the caf�, texting someone on her phone. It&#x2019;s probably Jack. They&#x2019;ll be discussing what to have for dinner, or making plans for the weekend. I like her maternity jeans. I need a pair like that&#x2014;something with an elasticized waist. I wonder where she bought them.<br> <br>Although I see Meg most days, I&#x2019;ve only ever spoken to her once. She asked if we had any more bran flakes, but we had sold out. I wish I could have said yes. I wish I could have gone back through the swinging plastic doors and returned with a box of bran flakes just for her.<br> <br>That was in early May. I suspected she was pregnant even then. A fortnight later she picked up a pregnancy test from the pharmacy aisle and my suspicions were confirmed. Now we&#x2019;re both in our third trimester with only six weeks to go and Meg has become my role model because she makes marriage and motherhood look so easy. For starters, she&#x2019;s drop-dead gorgeous. I bet she could easily have been a model&#x2014;not the bulimic catwalk kind, or the Page Three stunner kind, but a wholesome and sexy girl-next-door type; the ones who advertise laundry detergent or home insurance and are always running across flowery meadows or along a beach with a Labrador.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m none of the above. I&#x2019;m not particularly pretty, nor am I plain. &#x201c;Unthreatening&#x201d; is probably the right word. I&#x2019;m the less attractive friend that all pretty girls need because I won&#x2019;t steal their limelight and will happily take their leftovers (food and boyfriends).<br> <br>One of the sad truths of retailing is that people don&#x2019;t notice shelf-stockers. I&#x2019;m like a vagrant sleeping in a doorway or a beggar holding up a cardboard sign&#x2014;invisible. Occasionally someone will ask me a question, but they never look at my face when I&#x2019;m answering. If there was a bomb scare at the supermarket and everyone was evacuated except me, the police would ask, &#x201c;Did you see anyone else in the shop?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d say.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about the shelf-stocker?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The person stocking the shelves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t take much notice of him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s me&#x2014;unseen, inappreciable, a shelf-stocker.<br> <br>I glance outside. Meg is walking towards the supermarket. The automatic doors open. She picks up a plastic shopping basket and wanders along aisle one&#x2014;fruit and veg. When she gets to the end she&#x2019;ll turn and head this way. I follow her progress and catch a glimpse of her when she passes the pasta and canned tomatoes.<br> <br>She turns into my aisle. I push the bucket to one side and step back, wondering if I should nonchalantly lean on my mop or shoulder it like a wooden rifle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Careful, the floor is wet,&#x201d; I say, sounding like I&#x2019;m talking to a two-year-old.<br> <br>My voice surprises her. She mumbles thank you and slides by, her belly almost touching mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;When are you due?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>Meg stops and turns. &#x201c;Early December.&#x201d; She notices that I&#x2019;m pregnant. &#x201c;How about you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The same.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What day?&#x201d; she asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;December fifth, but it could be sooner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A boy or a girl?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. How about you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;s carrying Lachlan&#x2019;s scooter. &#x201c;You already have one,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; she replies.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow!&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m staring at her. I tell myself to look away. I glance at my feet, then the bucket, the condensed milk, the custard powder. I should say something else. I can&#x2019;t think.<br> <br>Meg&#x2019;s basket is heavy. &#x201c;Well, good luck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You too,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s gone, heading towards the checkout. Suddenly, I think of all the things I could have said. I could have asked where she was having the baby. What sort of birth? I could have commented on her stretch jeans. Asked her where she bought them.<br> <br>Meg has joined the queue at the register, flicking through the gossip magazines as she waits her turn. The new Vogue isn&#x2019;t out, but she settles for Tatler and a copy of Private Eye.<br> <br>Mr. Patel begins scanning her items: eggs, milk, potatoes, mayonnaise, arugula, and Parmesan. You can tell a lot about a person from the contents of a shopping cart; the vegetarians, vegans, alcoholics, chocaholics, weight watchers, cat lovers, dog owners, dope smokers, celiacs, the lactose intolerant and those with dandruff, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, constipation, or ingrown toenails.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s how I know so much about Meg. I know she&#x2019;s a lapsed vegetarian who started eating red meat again when she fell pregnant, most likely because of the iron. She likes tomato-based sauces, fresh pasta, cottage cheese, dark chocolate, and those shortbread biscuits that come in tins.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve spoken to her properly now. We&#x2019;ve made a connection. We&#x2019;re going to be friends, Meg and I, and I&#x2019;ll be just like her. I&#x2019;ll make a lovely home and keep my man happy. We&#x2019;ll do yoga classes and swap recipes and meet for coffee every Friday morning with our mothers&#x2019; group.</p><h2>Houdini&#39;s &#34;Girl Detective&#34;: The Real-Life Ghost-Busting Adventures of Rose Mackenberg</h2><p>The 1920s: a time of unprecedented belief in "spiritualism", or the practice of ostensibly communicating with the spirits of the dead.&nbsp;Into this milieu stepped Rose Mackenberg, a private detective trained by the great magician and escape artist, Harry Houdini.

Congress authorized the organization of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later renamed Women's Army Corps) in 1942, and hundreds of women were able to join in the war effort. Charity Edna Adams became the first black woman commissioned as an officer.<br><br> Black members of the WAC had to fight the prejudices not only of males who did not want women in their "man's army," but also of those who could not accept blacks in positions of authority or responsibility, even in the segregated military. <br><br> With unblinking candor, Charity Adams Earley tells of her struggles and successes as the WAC's first black officer and as commanding officer of the only organization of black women to serve overseas during World War II. The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion broke all records for redirecting military mail as she commanded the group through its moves from England to France and stood up to the racist slurs of the general under whose command the battalion operated. The Six Triple Eight stood up for its commanding officer, supporting her boycott of segregated living quarters and recreational facilities. <br><br> This book is a tribute to those courageous women who paved the way for patriots, regardless of color or gender, to serve their country.</p><p>CHARITY ADAMS EARLEY served in the Women's Army Corps from 13 July 1942 to 26 March 1946 and was discharged with the rank of lieutenant colonel, the highest rank below that of the WAC director.&nbsp;In her memoir, Earley, the first black officer in the WWII-era Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps, recalls her rise to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Gonzo</h2><p>Hailed everywhere as a brilliant biography, GONZO is a startling portrait of Hunter S. Thompson, the genius who spent a lifetime channeling his energy and insight into such landmark works as <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas--</em>and revolutionized the art of writing. In their own words, an incredible array of stars--Sonny Barger, Jack Nicholson, Ralph Steadman, Jimmy Buffett, Anjelica Huston, Marilyn Manson, Jimmy Carter, and many more--bring into vivid focus Thompson's creative frenzies, love affairs, drug use, and, ultimately, his tragic suicide. As Thompson was fond of saying, "Buy the ticket, take the ride."<br><br>"<i>Gonzo</i>...is no hagiography, and it is in its unflinching look at this singular character in American letters as fearless-if not more so-as anything Thompson ever dared write....The most comprehensive picture of Thompson so far, and...likely the best we'll ever get." --Patrick Beach, <i>Austin American-Statesman</i><br><br><em></em> "A fond and exhilarating look back at the wild man of American journalism, put together by a couple of guys who were pretty close to him." --Billy Heller, <i>New York</i><i> Post</i></p><p>Jann S. Wenner is the founder, owner and editor of Rolling Stone magazine. He is also the head of Wenner Media, which includes such magazines as US Weekly and Men's Journal. He lives in Manhattan. <br><br>Corey Seymour is a writer and editor who came to know Hunter Thompson while working as his New York-based assistant during his tenure at Rolling Stone in the early nineties. He lives in Brooklyn.Starred Review. Uproarious and unpredictable, this oral biography is a fitting look at the turbulent life of Gonzo journalism pioneer Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005), a life surrounded by many but understood by few: "always pushing," Thompson "created a kind of inner circle of people who stood the test." That circle is well represented among the volume's many "voices," including ex-wife Sandy Thompson and their son, Juan, longtime collaborator Ralph Steadman, actors Johnny Depp and Jack Nicholson, and old friends Porter Bibb and Ed Bastian. The story-tellers provide a great number of angles, bringing forth insight that goes well beyond Thompson's famous love for alcohol and drugs-though they don't neglect the intoxicants, nor the eccentric writer's most obvious quirks (such as his indiscriminate verbal outbursts: "he was always yelling at himself, like 'AAHHH!!! CAZART!!!'"). A rich, rollicking vision of Thompson that highlights his outlandish personality and his passion for language ("He started typing out Fitzgerald and Hemingway books word for word... he said, 'I just like to get the feel of how it is to write those words.'"), Wenner and Seymour's work also encompasses the unlikely transition of Gonzo from radical, reactionary style-du-jour to culture-defining literature: "Only a handful of writers in a generation can pull that off, and Hunter transcended his competition." This fine, fond biography amuses, inspires, outrages and haunts at all the right moments-and sometimes all at once. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hated and feared by many, he schemed to win the love of the beautiful goddess Parvati . . . but learned an important lesson when he invited her elephant-headed son Ganesha over for lunch one day . . . So goes one of the many delightful tales in this decidedly grown-up book of traditional Indian stories, retold for the modern reader. Author Kamla Kapur is well known in her native India as a poet and playwright, and her connection to these age-old stories is the reverent yet individualistic one we might expect from someone whose introduction tells of her hometown, where naked, dreadlocked holy men speed about on motorbikes. To collect these stories, Kapur relied on ancient sacred texts, modern scholarship, and chance encounters with interesting people who just happened to know a really good one about this time that Vishnu sank into the ocean, was incarnated as a pig, and had a really wonderful time. Like myths around the world, these are teaching stories that offer both a window into a fascinating culture that has endured for thousands of years, and a code for living that can be applied to the modern world.</p><p>Kamla K. Kapur is the author of Ganesha Goes to Lunch, Rumi&#x2019;s Tales from the Silk Road, and The Singing Guru. Kapur has also published two books of poetry, As a Fountain in a Garden and Radha Sings: Erotic Love Poems, numerous short stories, and a series of award-winning plays.

Instead it presents a whole new way of eating, a new way of seeing food, exercise, and the body. Revolutionary, it also strikes a deep chord of common sense.

D. Ross with an Introduction by R. W. Browne)</h2><p>Composed of ten books and based upon Aristotle&#x2019;s own notes from his lectures at the Lyceum, &#x201c;Nicomachean Ethics&#x201d; holds a pre-eminent place amongst the ancient treatises on moral philosophy. As opposed to other pre-Socratic works, &#x201c;Nicomachean Ethics&#x201d; moves beyond the purely theoretical analysis of moral philosophy by examining its practical application. Aristotelian ethics is concerned with how an individual should best live their life and at its core asserts the idea that the most virtuous life will be the happiest one. By living well, in balance with one&#x2019;s environment, eschewing excess, guiding one&#x2019;s life by reason, Aristotle argues, is the path towards the most virtuous and thus the happiest life. Aristotle&#x2019;s ethical philosophy had a profound influence on ancient civilization, an influence that was sustained until the rise of Christianity which contradicted the premise of Aristotelian ethics by asserting that the most virtuous life was to be achieved instead by living an austere life of sacrifice devoted to God.

A black Porsche Cayenne pulled alongside. It was 2:00 p.m., Sunday, September 2, 2007, and the normally congested streets adjacent to the storied Sukharevskaya Square were devoid of traffic, apart from the tourists and locals strolling the broad sidewalks on either side of the boulevard. The afternoon sun that bathed the streets in warmth throughout the day was beginning to cast long shadows on the street from the historic buildings nearby.</p> <p> The driver of the BMW, a notorious local scam artist who went by the hacker nickname "Jaks," had just become a father that day, and Jaks and his passenger had toasted the occasion with prodigious amounts of vodka. It was the perfect time and place to settle a simmering rivalry with the Porsche driver over whose ride was faster. Now each driver revved his engine in an unspoken agreement to race the short, straight distance to the big city square directly ahead.</p><p> As the signal flashed green, the squeal of rubber peeling off on concrete echoed hundreds of meters down in the main square. Bystanders turned to watch as the high-performance machines lurched from the intersection, each keeping pace with the other and accelerat�ing at breakneck speed.</p><p> Roaring past the midpoint of the race at more than 200 kilometers per hour, Jaks suddenly lost control, clipping the Porsche and careen�ing into a huge metal lamp post. In an instant, the competition was over, with neither car the winner. The BMW was sliced in two, the Porsche a smoldering, crumpled wreck close by. The drivers of both cars crawled and limped away from the scene, but the BMW's passenger-a promising twenty-three-year-old Internet entrepreneur named Nikolai McColo-was killed instantly, his almost headless body pinned under the luxury car.</p><p> "Kolya," as McColo was known to friends, was a minor celebrity in the cybercriminal underground, the youngest employee of a family-owned Internet hosting business that bore his nickname-McColo Corp. At a time when law-enforcement agencies worldwide were just waking up to the financial and organizational threats from organized cybercrime, McColo Corp. had earned a reputation as a ground zero for it: a place where cybercrooks could reliably set up shop with little worry that their online investments and schemes would be discovered or jeopardized by foreign law-enforcement investigators.</p><p> At the time of Kolya's death, his family's hosting provider was home base for the largest businesses on the planet engaged in pumping out junk email or "spam" via robot networks. Called "botnets" for short, these networks are collections of personal computers that have been hacked and seeded with malicious software-or "malware"-that lets the attackers control the systems from afar. Usually, the owners of these computers have no idea their machines have been taken hostage.</p><p> Nearly all of the botnets controlled from McColo were built to blast out the unsolicited junk spam advertisements that flood our inboxes and spam filters every day. But the servers at McColo weren't generating and pumping spam themselves; that would attract too much attention from Internet vigilantes and Western law-enforcement agencies. Instead, they were merely used by the botmaster businesses to manipulate millions of PCs scattered around the globe into becoming spam-spewing zombies.</p><p> By the time paramedics had cleared the area of Kolya's accident, gruesome images of the carnage were already being uploaded to secre�tive Russian Internet forums frequented by McColo's friends and business clients.... This was a major event in the cybercrime underworld.</p><p> Days later, the motley crew of Moscow-based spammers would gather to pay their last respects at his service. The ceremony was held at the same church where Kolya had been baptized less than twenty-three years earlier. Among those in attendance were Igor "Desp" Gusev and Dmitry "SaintD" Stupin, coadministrators of SpamIt and GlavMed, until recently the world's largest sponsors of spam1-and two figures that will play key roles in this book.</p><p> Also at the service was Dmitry "Gugle" Nechvolod, then twenty-five years old and a hacker who was closely connected to the Cutwail botnet. Cutwail is a massive crime machine that has infected tens of millions of home computers around the globe and secretly seized control over them for sending spam. To this day, Cutwail remains one of the largest and most active spam botnets-although it is almost undoubtedly run by many different individuals now (more on this in Chapter 7, "Meet the Spammers").</p><p> So why is it important to note these three men's presence at such a momentous event for cybercrime? Because their work (as well as Kolya's and hundreds of others) impacts every one of us every day in a strange but seriously significant way: spam email.</p><p> Indeed, spam email has become the primary impetus for the devel�opment of malicious software-programs that strike computers like yours and mine every day-and through them, target our identities, our security, our finances, families, and friends. These botnets are virtual parasites that require care and constant feeding to stay one step ahead of antivirus tools and security firms who work to dismantle the networks. </p><p> This technological arms race requires the development, production, and distribution of ever-stealthier malware that can evade constantly changing antivirus and anti-spam defenses. Therefore, the hackers at the throttle of these massive botnets also use spam as a form of self-preservation. The same botnets that spew plain old spam typically are used to distribute junk email containing new versions of the malware that helps spread the contagion. In addition, spammers often reinvest their earnings from spamming people in building better, stronger, and sneakier malicious software that can bypass antivirus and anti-spam software and firewalls. The spam ecosystem is a constantly evolving technological and sociological crime machine that feeds on itself.</p><p> Given the increasing menace of spam email and related cybersecurity assaults that directly affect consumers and companies (like the major news story I broke to the media in December 2013 about the Target credit-card database breach-a cyberattack that compromised millions of Americans' financial information and forced an even greater number of us to get new credit cards), you may be wondering why governments, law-enforcement officials, and corporations aren't taking a stronger and more significant stance to stop the tidal wave of spam and cybercrime impacting us all.</p><p> Part of the reason is that many policymakers and cybercrime experts tend to dismiss spam as a nuisance problem that can be solved or at least mitigated to a manageable degree by the proper mix of technology and law enforcement. For many of the rest of us, spam has become almost the punch line of a joke, thanks to its close association with male penile-enhancement pills and erectile dysfunction medica�tions such as Viagra and Cialis. We assume that if we don't open the emails or don't purchase anything from them, we aren't affected.</p><p> Unfortunately, that attitude underscores a popular yet funda�mental miscalculation about the threat that spam poses to every one of us.</p><p> </p></p><h2>Just a Second</h2><p>What happens in just a second?&nbsp;A bat makes 200 high-pitched calls.&nbsp;A hummingbird beats its wings 50 times.&nbsp;A woodpecker hammers a tree trunk with its beak 20 times.&nbsp;A human can blink 7 times.&nbsp;A vulture in fight flaps its wings once.&nbsp;&nbsp;This nonfiction picture book explores the concept of time as a series of events in the natural world that take place in given units of time.&nbsp;Steve Jenkins's stunning collage illustrations and fascinating collection of facts create an&nbsp;engaging and interconnected look at time, animals, science, and the natural world.</p><p><p><b>Steve Jenkins </b>has written and illustrated many nonfiction picture books for young readers, including the Caldecott Honor-winning <i>What Do You Do with a Tail Like This?</i> His books have been called stunning, eye-popping, inventive, gorgeous, masterful, extraordinary, playful, irresistible, compelling, engaging, accessible, glorious, and informative.

The Great Fire rages through the city, consuming everything in its path. Even the impregnable cathedral of St. Paul&#39;s is engulfed in flames and reduced to ruins. Among the crowds watching its destruction is Richard Marwood, son of a disgraced printer, and reluctant government informer. In the aftermath of the fire, a semi-mummified body is discovered in the ashes of St. Paul&#39;s, in a tomb that should have been empty.

We prefer our fantasies in opposition to the facts of life. It was a routine venture now revered because we desperately need to have a heroic past, since that pleasure is denied to us in the present. The expedition was initiated following Jefferson's finesse of Congress and the Constitution in the purchase of a mere claim by France that it "owned" a substantial portion of the North American West because a Frenchman had first set foot on lands drained by the Mississippi. Not only did the expedition seek a practical water route to the West Coast with the eventual goal of opening the Pacific to American commerce, but Jefferson also needed to prove that the purchase of an unknown territory was not a white elephant. (He did, however, caution Lewis and Clark to be on the lookout for mammoths while en route.)<br><br>Since traditionally historians have understood the journey as the first effort by civilized men to pierce the unknown West, we often tend to clothe the accounts of Lewis and Clark in more heroic terms than they seem to have deserved. Much good history falls by the wayside when we stress the heroics and neglect the context of their journey in our understanding. The expedition actually seems to have been a tedious march from one place to another made known to them by Indians and French traders, with an occasional incident to testify to the strangeness of the land and the unique challenges that the West presented.<br><br>After reading through the journals edited by Elliott Coues, my impression of the memorable experiences of the expedition, the things that would have remained with its members years after their return, revolved around three major topics, although I must admit that a strong case might be made for several other themes. But the things that impressed me were the fact that Frenchmen had already explored much of this region so that it was reasonably well known to many people, that there seemed to be an oversupply of bears on the prairies and bottomlands, and that sandbars posed a continuing barrier to the expedition, making the development of a heavy and easy commerce with the Orient via an inland waterway impossible. Indeed, travel later to the Montana area depended heavily on the spring snowmelt and required special flat-bottom boats.<br><br>The accounts of the journey to the West Coast contain those wonderful na�ve observations that always come with first discovery. Consequently the responses of the Corps of Discovery to these new experiences provide us with good insight into their feelings and what they believed they were doing, and record the occasional misfortunes of the group, which became traumas because they were unexpected. Entries on the return trip record fewer surprises and illustrate the confidence and sometimes arrogance that experience often brings.<br><br>That they had the confidence that they could split the little company and explore different river systems with the expectation that they knew the land so well that they could meet again in more familiar territory suggests that they felt they had conquered the West. The final report would therefore be couched in the optimistic terms of men who had overcome severe hardships and now stood ready for another challenge. They had breached the unknown, albeit with considerable assistance from the local inhabitants, and now believed in their own superiority, a mood that would shortly energize people to emulate their feats and bring about the ruination of the Great American West.<br><br>Before we examine the Indian understanding of the expedition, let us walk with the explorers on their first encounter with the land and its peoples. We have traditionally been taught to believe that the Lewis and Clark expedition was the first penetration of white men into the western lands. This belief is totally unfounded. The locations of the Mandan villages, scattered from the present North Dakota-South Dakota line along the Missouri River to some distance above present-day Bismarck, were already common knowledge. French and British traders had already established a thriving commerce with these villages and the sedentary Indians were accustomed to dealing with foreigners.<br><br>A good portion of the trip while moving through wild and unoccupied country did not involve discovery of the West but merely followed paths already well established. Thus when the expedition visited the Yankton Sioux camp, the Indians were flying a Spanish flag, and it is well known that these Sioux had attended the British conference at Albany prior to the American Revolution. They would also send warriors to support the British during the War of 1812. The coastal tribes in Washington and Oregon had already been visited by the English and Spanish and had routed the Spanish expansion.<br><br>More important, however, was the presence of French trappers in the area. The growing population of half-breeds of French-Indian heritage, some people representing second and perhaps even third generations of men out on the plains, indicated that white men had lived among the tribes for a considerable period of time. Above the great bend near present-day Pierre, South Dakota, the expeditioners visited a Frenchman's house that had no protective palisade, testifying to the fact that the French had successfully melded with the Indians long ago.<br><br>French colonial policy had encouraged intermarriage with the Indians and the exchange of children to create kinship bonds with the eastern tribes. The French sought to create a new kind of society of mixed Euro-Indian genetic background that would and could hold the lands claimed by the French king under the Doctrine of Discovery by appealing to their common ancestry. This class of people was now temporarily loyal to whoever could enhance their fortunes. Most of them had extensive experience in wandering the western lands, and, in sharing their knowledge about the land and its people, they enabled Lewis and Clark to anticipate some of the problems that lay ahead. But they had no loyalty to the Americans, nor would they have for some time to come.<br><br>The Frenchmen represented a good deal more than easing the psychological burdens of the unknown lying ahead for the expedition. Indeed, their presence indicated the existence of a society in which manufactured goods were becoming increasingly valuable, as steel knives replaced flint weapons and guns were coveted for both hunting and war. The value to be given in exchange for these industrial products would have to be the skins and hides of animals that were temporarily valuable when beaver hats were stylish or when there was a lack of available leather on the European markets. The land could sustain the wildlife it had but was not so productive that animals could replenish their numbers in the face of extensive hunting above and beyond simple human subsistence. The primary objects of Indian commerce were the hides and skins of the animals that also inhabited the land, and there were a finite number of these creatures, although at the time the herds of grazers seemed without number.<br><br>Actually in the journals we find few references to large herds of buffalo or even to the massive dams and villages of the beaver, whose pelts would later be the primary items of trapping and trading. Beaver seem to merit sparse attention when recording the fauna of the region. There are probably more references to rattlesnakes than to beaver, since the men seemed almost hypnotized by these serpents, hardly an item of trade. Lewis and Clark almost certainly saw the wildlife as a barrier to be overcome and not as commodities that would constitute the major portion of trade for the next eight decades.<br><br>Some of the half-breeds were not descendants of the local tribes. Pierre Dorian, for example, seems to have been part Iowa Indian, as does his wife. Here we see the results of the displacement of tribes in the Midwest who had been trading with the French and British for more than two centuries. Although there had been no removal treaties affecting the midwestern tribes at that time from which these people might have been fleeing, the fabric of their communal life had long since been torn apart by intermarriage and trade wars. As members of the eastern tribes had experienced the course of empire, they joined in and moved west to become a part of the impending invasion and serve as bicultural brokers in the transactions that lay ahead.<br><br>This new class of people would also help open the Pacific Northwest to commerce and exploration. As the Hudson's Bay Company extended its trading posts and influence in the western Rockies and Columbia basin, it employed Iroquois voyageurs who had only a smattering knowledge of the Christian religion but loved to sing Catholic hymns, relying on their rhythms to measure the oar strokes of the trade canoes. These hymns would later inspire the Nez Perces and Flatheads to send a delegation to St. Louis in search of these power songs, triggering the missionary movement toward the Oregon country that ended in disaster for all concerned.<br><br>Could these people be described as an indigenous population as we think of one today? To the expedition they were indistinguishable from the local tribes except for the obvious language differences and the warlike proclivities of the tribes claiming and defending extensive territories. Certainly they were seen as a different class from tribal Indians in Canada, who eventually become known as the Metis (mixed-blood people), the constituency of Louis Riel, who regarded themselves as equal members of Canadian society. They appear later in the 1870s as invaders of the northern hunting grounds, feared and resisted fiercely by the tribes living in the United States. Annually they brought large numbers of hunters with freight wagons and families south across the border to hunt buffalo when their own herds had been thinned out, thus escalating the depletion of the northern buffalo herd more rapidly than expected.<br><br>Certainly the invasive half-breeds played a critical role in arranging the first treaties between the United States and the northern Plains tribes, treaties incidentally negotiated by William Clark after his exploring days were done. As time went on American whites became the scouts, hunters, and interpreters for subsequent expeditions mounted in St. Louis and Leavenworth, and with some exceptions the French-Indian half-breeds declined in importance. Their descendants today dominate tribal politics in most of the Great Lakes and Plains tribes. Indeed, for some tribes, having French ancestors rather than English is a sign of distinction.<br><br>Think of what these people represented, however, and we begin to visualize an alternative possible scenario for the settling of the West. The French colonial policy was to encourage intermarriage with the natives and the exchange of children who would be raised in a different society so that over time they would help create a society that treated lands, resources, and people in a much different manner than the English/Americans did. Would the interior of the United States have been developed with a goal of maintaining a sustainable yield of products rather than of exhausting the resources? Would treaties even have been necessary if the various tribes had adopted enough of French culture that they adapted their institutions to resemble those of western Europe and guaranteed equality in both law and custom to new settlers of the region?<br><br>Could a mixed-blood government have dealt with the United States on better terms? We would like to think so, although the experiences of the Five Civilized Tribes suggest otherwise. But the Five Tribes possessed valuable farming lands in the South, whereas the northern plains hardly offered the settlers much comfort, so the demand for land would not have been as intense. To what degree would mixed-bloods' willingness to accommodate themselves to technology and opportunity have produced an ecologically sound society?<br><br>This distant prospect seems not impossible if we read the journals of the trip. From St. Louis to the Mandan villages it appears that the Frenchmen had a vital place in the region's social environment. Quite casually we learn that the French were building houses and settling in near the Big Bend without any immediate or prolonged conflict with the tribes using the same area as hunting grounds. We can understand the sense of relief felt by the men whenever the expedition came across Frenchmen, as if they had brought the entirety of the European perspective with them. That the Frenchmen felt entirely at home and possessors of the same knowledge of the land as the Indians suggests that in large part the Gallic colonial goal had been achieved.<br><br>The experience of the Yankton Sioux with the French and Americans is interesting and demonstrates how deeply the French had intruded into Indian life. As the Corps of Discovery approached the Yankton Sioux territory they encountered Pierre Dorian, Jr., the son of their interpreter who had ensured that they receive a warm and friendly reception. Instead of the haughty attitude that Lewis and Clark often showed toward Indians, negotiations with the Yanktons went smoothly. Their generosity in giving the chiefs both medals and clothing impressed them. A Yankton chief summarized the difference: "I went formerly to the English, and they gave me some clothes; when I went to the Spanish they gave me a medal. But nothing to keep it from my skin; but now you give me a medal and clothes."</p><h2>Murphy&#39;s Boy</h2><p><p><strong>"A story rich in reasons for hope." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><p><strong>From the bestselling author of <em>One Child</em>, the true story of a boy who refused to speak--until a therapist's love broke through the silence. </strong></p><p>When Torey Hayden first met fifteen-year-old Kevin, he was barricaded under a table.

And it will send the story into the past of the Hudson River Valley, from the late 1960's back to the anticommunist riots of the 1940's to the late seventeenth century, where the long-hidden secrets of three families--the aristocratic van Warts, the Native-American Mohonks, and Walter's own ancestors, the van Brunts--will be revealed.</p></p><p>T. Coraghessan Boyle, author of <i>Water Music</i>, a hilarious reinvention of the exploration of the Niger, returns to his native New York State with this darkly comic historical drama exploring several generations of families in the Hudson River Valley. Walter Van Brunt begins the book with a catastrophic motorcycle accident that sends him back on a historical investigation, eventually encompassing the frontier struggles of the late 1600s. Any book that opens with a three-page "list of principal characters" and includes chapters titled "The Last of the Kitchawanks," "The Dunderberg Imp," and "Hail, Arcadia!" promises a welcome tonic to the self-conscious inwardness of much contemporary fiction; <i>World's End</i> delivers and was rewarded with the PEN/Faulkner Award for 1988.T. C. Boyle is the author of eleven novels, including <b>World's End</b> (winner of the PEN/FaulknerAward), <b>Drop City</b> (a <b>New York Times</b> bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award), and <b>The Inner Circle</b>. His most recent story collections are <b>Tooth and Claw</b> and <b>The Human Fly and Other Stories</b>. <p> </p></p><h2>Getting the Best of It</h2><p>Contains six sections discussing probability, poker, blackjack, other casino games, sports betting, and general gambling concepts. This book contains some of the most sophisticated gambling ideas that have ever been put into print. Included is perhaps the best discussion of the basic mathematics of gambling, yet it is written so that even the most non-mathematical of readers can understand it. Many of the ideas discussed are those that the author himself has successfully used during his career. Topics include expectation, combinations, Baye&#39;s Theorem, the eight mistakes in poker, checking in the dark, playing tight, The Key Card Concept, casinos and their mistakes, crapless craps, betting sports, hedging and middling, knowing what&#39;s important, the Law of Averages and Other Fallacies, and much more.</p><p>David Sklansky is generally considered the number one authority on gambling in the world today. Besides his ten books on the subject, David also has produced two videos and numerous writings for various gaming publications. His occasional poker seminars always receive an enthusiastic reception, including those given at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. <p>More recently, David has been doing consulting work for casinos, Internet gaming sites, and gaming device companies. He has recently invented several games, soon to appear in casinos. </p><p>David attributes his standing in the gambling community to three things: </p><p>1. The fact that he presents his ideas as simply as possible (sometimes with Mason Malmuth) even though these ideas frequently involve concepts that are deep, subtle, and not to be found elsewhere. </p><p>2. The fact that the things he says and writes can be counted on to be accurate. </p><p>3. The fact that to this day a large portion of his income is still derived from gambling (usually poker, but occasionally blackjack, sports betting, horses, video games, casino promotions, or casino tournaments). </p><p>Thus, those who depend on David&#x2019;s advice know that he still depends on it himself.</p></p><h2>A Kingdom Strange: The Brief and Tragic History of the Lost Colony of Roanoke</h2><p><b>The "gripping adventure story" (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>) of the Lost Colony of Roanoke and the mystery at the center of the American founding</b><br>In 1587, John White led 118 English men, women, and children to Roanoke Island, off the coast of North Carolina, intending to establish the first English colony in America. Faced with dwindling supplies and hostile Indians, they soon found themselves struggling to survive. White returned to England for help, but when he returned to Roanoke in 1590, the colonists were nowhere to be found; never saw his friends or family again. Their disappearance has remained a mystery for four centuries, but as James Horn reveals in <i>A Kingdom Strange</i>, some from the party survived. Their descendants were discovered a century later, a living testament to America's remarkable origins.<br></p><p><b>James Horn</b> is the president of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation. He is author and editor of five books on colonial American history, including <i>A Land As God Made It: Jamestown and the Birth of America</i> and <i>1619: Jamestown and the Forging of American Democracy</i>. He lives in Richmond, Virginia.Starred Review. A leading historian of early Virginia, Horn (<i>A Land as God Made It</i>) relates the convoluted, fascinating story of the failed 1598 venture on Roanoke Island: a British settlement whose 100 men, women, and children disappeared without a trace. Horn teases from the record as no one before the Lost Colony of 1587, which had not even been intended to settle on the island. Horn recounts its travails, hostilities with the Indians, requests to England for support that failed to arrive for three years, by which time the settlers were gone. Based on the available evidence, Horn finds that the colonists did not die but intermarried with local Indians. Over a century later, a North Carolina settler, venturing to Roanoke Island, found Indians who claimed Englishmen among their ancestors (and some gray-eyed tribesmen seemed to support the claim). He places it all in the context of the political and economic tumult of the time for an outstanding historical mystery/adventure tale with an ending perhaps less tragic than historians have long believed.

Philip, irritated, was knocking the dottle out of his pipe on one of the gateposts while Vernon gave the buzzer a couple of vigorous presses. The house stood beyond them, silent and dark, rising from the top of the hill like some pasha&#x2019;s palace, its clerestories, chimneys, and towers gilded in the rich afternoon light of Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like Father to be late,&#x201d; said Philip. He slipped the pipe between his white teeth and closed down on the stem with a little click. He gave the buzzer a stab of his own, checked his watch, shot his cuff. Philip looked pretty much the same, Tom thought: briar pipe, sardonic eye, cheeks well shaved and after-shaved, hair brushed straight back from a tall brow, gold watch winking at the wrist, dressed in gray worsted slacks and navy jacket. His English accent seemed to have gotten a shade plummier. Vernon, on the other hand, in his gaucho pants, sandals, long hair, and beard, looked uncannily like Jesus Christ.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s playing another one of his games with us,&#x201d; said Vernon, giving the buzzer a few more jabs. The wind whispered through the pi�on trees, bringing with it a smell of warm resin and dust. The great house was silent.<br>The smell of Philip&#x2019;s expensive tobacco drifted on the air. He turned to Tom. &#x201c;And how are things, Tom, out there among the Indians?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine&#x201d;.<br>&#x201c;Glad to hear it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And with you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Terrific. Couldn&#x2019;t be better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vernon?&#x201d; Tom asked.<br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine. Just great.&#x201d;<br>The conversation faltered, and they looked around at each other, and then away, embarrassed. Tom never had much to say to his brothers. A crow passed overhead, croaking. An uneasy silence settled on the group gathered at the gate. After a long moment Philip gave the buzzer a fresh series of jabs and scowled through the wrought iron, grasping the bars. &#x201c;His car&#x2019;s still in the garage. The buzzer must be broken.&#x201d; He drew in air. &#x201c;Halloo! Father! Halloo! Your devoted sons are here!&#x201d;<br>There was a creaking sound as the gate opened slightly under his weight.<br>&#x201c;The gate&#x2019;s unlocked,&#x201d; Philip said in surprise. &#x201c;He <i>never</i> leaves the gate unlocked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s inside, waiting for us,&#x201d; said Vernon. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br>They put their shoulders to the heavy gate and swung it open on protesting hinges. Vernon and Philip went back to get their cars and park them inside, while Tom walked in. He came face-to-face with the house&#x2014;his childhood home. How many years since his last visit? Three? It filled him with odd and conflicting sensations, the adult coming back to the scene of his childhood. It was a Santa Fe compound in the grandest sense. The graveled driveway swept in a semicircle past a massive pair of seventeenth-century zaguan doors, spiked together from slabs of hand-hewn mesquite. The house itself was a low-slung adobe structure with curving walls, sculpted buttresses, vigas, latillas, nichos, portals, real chimney pots&#x2014;a work of sculptural art in itself. It was surrounded by cottonwood trees and an emerald lawn. Situated at the top of a hill, it had sweeping views of the mountains and high desert, the lights of town, and the summer thunderheads rearing over the Jemez Mountains. The house hadn&#x2019;t changed, but it felt different. Tom reflected that maybe it was he who was different.<br>One of the garage doors was open, and Tom saw his father&#x2019;s green Mercedes Gelaendewagen parked in the bay. The other two bays were shut. He heard his brother&#x2019;s cars come crunching around the driveway, stopping by the portal. The doors slammed, and they joined Tom in front of the house.<br>That was when a troubled feeling began to gather in the pit of Tom&#x2019;s stomach.<br>&#x201c;What are we waiting for?&#x201d; asked Philip, mounting the portal and striding up to the zaguan doors, giving the doorbell a firm series of depresses. Vernon and Tom followed.<br>There was nothing but silence.<br>Philip, always impatient, gave the bell a final stab. Tom could hear the deep chimes going off inside the house. It sounded like the first few bars of &#x201c;Mame,&#x201d; which, he thought, would be typical of Father&#x2019;s ironic sense of humor.<br>&#x201c;Halloo!&#x201d; Philip called through cupped hands.<br>Still nothing.<br>&#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;s all right?&#x201d; Tom asked. The uneasy feeling was getting stronger.<br>&#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Philip crossly. &#x201c;This is just another one of his games.&#x201d; He pounded on the great Mexican door with a closed fist, booming and rattling it.<br>As Tom looked about, he saw that the yard had an unkempt look, the grass unmowed, new weeds sprouting in the tulip beds.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a look in a window,&#x201d; Tom said.<br>He forced his way through a hedge of trimmed chamisa, tiptoed through a flower bed, and peered in the living room window. Something was very wrong, but it took him a moment to realize just what. The room seemed normal: same leather sofas and wing chairs, same stone fireplace, same coffee table. But above the fireplace there had been a big painting&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t remember which one&#x2014;and now it was gone. He racked his brains. Was it the Braque or the Monet? Then he noticed that the Roman bronze statue of a boy that held court to the left of the fireplace was also gone. The bookshelves revealed holes where books had been taken out. The room had a disorderly look. Beyond the doorway to the hall he could see trash lying on the floor, some crumpled paper, a strip of bubble wrap, and a discarded roll of packing tape.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Doc?&#x201d; Philip&#x2019;s voice came floating around the corner.<br>&#x201c;You better have a look.&#x201d;<br>Philip picked his way through the bushes with his Ferragamo wingtips, a look of annoyance screwed into his face. Vernon followed.<br>Philip peeked through the window, and he gasped. &#x201c;The Lippi,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Over the sofa. The Lippi&#x2019;s gone! And the Braque over the fireplace! He&#x2019;s taken it all away! He&#x2019;s sold it!&#x201d;<br>Vernon spoke. &#x201c;Philip, don&#x2019;t get excited. He probably just packed the stuff up. Maybe he&#x2019;s moving. You&#x2019;ve been telling him for years this house was too big and isolated.&#x201d;<br>Philip&#x2019;s face relaxed abruptly. &#x201c;Yes. Of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That must be what this mysterious meeting&#x2019;s all about,&#x201d; Vernon said.<br>Philip nodded and mopped his brow with a silk handkerchief. &#x201c;I must be tired from the flight. Vernon, you&#x2019;re right. Of course they&#x2019;ve been packing. But what a mess they&#x2019;ve made of it. When Father sees this he&#x2019;s going to have a fit.&#x201d;<br>There was a silence as all three sons stood in the shrubbery looking at each other. Tom&#x2019;s own sense of unease had reached a high pitch. If their father was moving, it was a strange way to go about it.<br>Philip took the pipe out of his mouth. &#x201c;What say, do you think this is another one of his little challenges to us? Some little puzzle?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to break in,&#x201d; Tom said.<br>&#x201c;The alarm.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The hell with the alarm.&#x201d;<br>Tom went around to the back of the house, his brothers following. He climbed over a wall into a small enclosed garden with a fountain. There was a bedroom window at eye level. Tom wrestled a rock out of the raised flower-bed wall. He brought it to the window, positioned himself, and hefted it to his shoulder.<br>&#x201c;Are you really going to smash the window?&#x201d; said Philip. &#x201c;How sporting.&#x201d;<br>Tom heaved the rock, and it went crashing through the window. As the tinkling of glass subsided they all waited, listening.<br>Silence.<br>&#x201c;No alarm,&#x201d; said Philip.<br>Tom shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like this.&#x201d;<br>Philip stared through the broken window, and Tom could see a sudden thought blooming on his face. Philip cursed and in a flash had vaulted through the broken windowframe&#x2014;wingtips, pipe, and all.<br>Vernon looked at Tom. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with him?&#x201d;<br>Without answering, Tom climbed through the window. Vernon followed.<br>The bedroom was like the rest of the house&#x2014;stripped of all art. It was a mess: dirty footprints on the carpet, trash, strips of packing tape, bubble wrap, and packing popcorn, along with nails and the sawed butt ends of lumber. Tom went to the hall. The view disclosed more bare walls where he remembered a Picasso, another Braque, and a pair of Mayan stelae. Gone, all gone.<br>With a rising feeling of panic he ventured down the hall, stopping at the archway to the living room. Philip was there, standing in the middle of the room, looking about, his face absolutely white. &#x201c;I told him again and again this would happen. He was so bloody careless, keeping all this stuff here. So damn bloody careless.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Vernon cried, alarmed. &#x201c;What is it, Philip? What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br>Philip said, his agonized voice barely above a whisper, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been robbed!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2004 by Splendide Mendax, Inc.</p><h2>All Corvettes Are Red (Inside the Rebirth of an American Legend)</h2><p>No other American car carries the mystique of the Corvette, and early in 1997, General Motors unveiled the stunning fifth-generation Corvette to universal acclaim. But GM's triumph was hard-won -- the legendary sports car had nearly fallen victim to internal company politics and a squeeze on profits. In this candid and compelling book, journalist James Schefter reveals the inside story of the people who saved and reinvented the Corvette, from the drawing board to the assembly line. <br> For eight years, Schefter enjoyed unprecedented access to every part of GM, including areas off-limits to many company vice presidents. A true insider, he observed the new Corvette's odyssey from sketch to clay model to prototype to production vehicle. He accompanied test drivers across scorching deserts and snow-packed mountains. And he came to know the fiercely dedicated team of designers, engineers, and executives who fought and achieved their dream: a new Corvette that is better conceived, better built, and less expensive than its predecessors.

Woodson. The thesis of Dr. Woodson's book is that blacks of his day were being culturally indoctrinated, rather than taught, in American schools. This conditioning, he claims, causes blacks to become dependent and to seek out inferior places in the greater society of which they are a part. He challenges his readers to become autodidacts and to "do for themselves", regardless of what they were taught:</p><p>History shows that it does not matter who is in power... those who have not learned to do for themselves and have to depend solely on others never obtain any more rights or privileges in the end than they did in the beginning.</p><p>Here is a quote from the book:</p><p>"When you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his 'proper place' and will stay in it. You do not need to send him to the back door. He will go without being told.

This account looks beyond the pretense of neutrality and objectivity often found in secular study, and brings to light the appropriation of scripture by politically motivated interpreters. Questioning the techniques taken for granted at divinity schools worldwide, their origins are traced to the writings of Machiavelli and Marsilio of Padua, the political projects of Henry VIII, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke, and the quest for an empire of science on the part of Descartes and Spinoza. Intellectual and inspiring, an argument is made for bringing Christianity back to biblical literacy.</p></p><p><b>Scott W. Hahn</b> holds the Fr. Michael Scanlan Chair of Biblical Theology at the Franciscan University of Steubenvile, where he's taught since 1990. He is also the Founder and President of the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology, and the author/editor of over forty books, including <i>Kinship by Covenant</i>, <i>The Kingdom of God as Liturgical Empire</i>, <i>Canon and Biblical Interpretation</i>, <i>Covenant and Communion</i>, <i>The Catholic Bible Dictionary</i>, and <i>The Lamb's Supper</i>. <b>Benjamin Wiker</b> is an author and a senior fellow with the Envoy Institute of Belmont Abbey College, the Discovery Institute, and the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology. Among his books are <i>A Meaningful World: How the Arts and Sciences Reveal the Genius of Nature</i>, <i>Answering the New Atheism</i>, and <i>Moral Darwinism</i>. He lives in Hopedale, Ohio."In this magisterial work of intellectual history, Hahn and Wiker have tackled the overwhelming bias of modern textual criticism of the Bible by going straight to the Gordian knot of its fractal agenda and cutting it through in a fashion reminiscent of the clarity of the Apostles themselves. As St Paul (1 Thess. 2:13) put it in his own context, the issue is whether the text is to be received by the Church merely as 'the word of men' or 'as it is in truth, the word of God.' In taking us back to the late Middle Ages for the roots of the secularizing agenda of the discipline, they give us a far more telling analysis of an ideological agenda and motives and than we could have without these pre-Enlightement foundations for the long attempt to secularize and thus marginalize the distinctive claims of Revelation. This is essential reading, and not just for biblical scholars." &#x2014;David Jeffrey, professor at Baylor University and editor of <i>The Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature</i> and <i>The King James Bible and the World it Made</i><br><br>"Hahn and Wiker show how the study of Scripture was transformed by centuries of conflict over the fundamentals of Western civilization. They demonstrate their thesis in minute detail. The Bible clearly emerges as the foundational document of western civilization and its academy." &#x2014;Jacob Neusner, professor of religion and senior fellow of the Institute of Advanced Theology at Bard College<br><br>"Years ago, then Cardinal Ratzinger called for a thoughtful critique of biblical criticism, and this book is the sort of study I believe he had in mind. As Hahn and Wiker demonstrate, historical criticism did not appear fully formed in the nineteenth century, and its problems are not primarily exegetical, but philosophical. Its intellectual roots reach back to the nominalism of the late middle ages, when subtle philosophical missteps set into motion alternate ways of reading Scripture that were alien not only to the Church and her tradition, but to the classical ways of interpreting texts. Historical criticism has its own history, and its development should be subject to the scrutiny of historical method, as it is in these pages." &#x2014;Archbishop Augustine DiNoia, secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship, consultor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith<br><br>"Biblical criticism has long been regarded as something scientific, and thus neutral and objective. Recent decades, however, have seen a rising awareness that scholarship is always situated and serves certain ends. In their well-researched, thoughtful, and painstaking study, Hahn and Wiker make a particular and necessary contribution to the history of biblical interpretation in going back not to nineteenth-century Germany, but rather the late medieval period and Renaissance, showing that the Erastian project of subjugating the Bible and the Christian faith to the power of the State has deeper roots and interpretive consequences than is often assumed. A must-read for those concerned with the place of the Bible and Christian faith in contemporary culture." &#x2014;Leroy Huizenga, professor of scripture, University of Mary, Bismarck, North Dakota<br><br><p>"Hahn and Wiker make the case that biblical criticism has been shaped by philosophical and political ideas that are often intrinsically hostile to Christian faith. This is an important work that will force its readers to readjust, and in some cases totally reject, what they had been taught about the objectivity and neutrality of contemporary approaches to God's Word." &#x2014;Francis J. Beckwith, professor of philosophy and Church-State Studies, Baylor University<br>"Over the last 20 centuries, no book has been researched, pondered, and prayed over as intensely as the Bible. Dr. Hahn has done all these things himself; but, more importantly, he has studied the work of many generations of Christians and Jews who have gone before him. Then he gathered the best of all that study to help you in your own reading. Because we're Catholic, we need to become biblically literate. We need to know the Bible well because we hunger for abundant life&#x2014;because we want to know Jesus, which is the same thing. Scott Hahn does a superb job of feeding his readers with the Word of God in this immensely useful guide." &#x2014;Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M.

Ney Professor of Jurisprudence and American institutions, Amherst College<br><br></p>"Scott Hahn and Benjamin Wiker have produced a scholarly masterpiece. The authors demonstrate how the roots of modern biblical criticism go back to the late medieval period, even prior to the Renaissance and Reformation. . . . The impressive combination of breadth, depth, and clarity achieved in this book is unrivaled in the field. By showing how these early critical readings of Scripture reflected and reinforced the "secularization" of modern thought, this work will have far-reaching implications on how the Bible is read in universities and seminaries, as well as how it is preached in pulpits. <i>Politicizing the Bible</i> is the most important work to date on the history of modern biblical criticism." &#x2014;Jeffrey Morrow, assistant professor of theology, Seton Hall University</p><h2>Shadow Fall (9) (Tracers)</h2><p>In the ninth romantic suspense novel in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Tracers series, author Laura Griffin brings back her elite cadre of forensic experts as they hunt down the most brutal serial killer yet.<br><br>Special Agent Tara Rushing arrives at a grisly murder scene and quickly discovers she&#x2019;s got a serial killer on her hands.

Catie&#x2019;s mind overflowed, her chest felt empty, and the craving dug into her with razor-sharp claws.<br> <br>Her shoulders tensed as she pulled into the park. All her life, she&#x2019;d been addicted to work and approval and success. Now she was simply an addict.<br> <br>Her high-performance tires glided over the ruts, absorbing the bumps as she eased along the drive. She turned into the gravel parking lot and swung into a space. Forty-six days.<br> <br>Resting her head on the wheel, she squeezed her eyes shut. Her throat tightened, and she fought the burn of tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;One day at a time,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>She sat up and gazed through the windshield. She&#x2019;d never thought she&#x2019;d be one of those people who gave themselves pep talks. She&#x2019;d never thought she&#x2019;d be a lot of things. Yet here she was.<br> <br>Catie shoved open the door and popped the trunk. She tossed her purse inside, then rummaged through her gym bag, looking for her iPod. On second thought, no music. She slammed the trunk closed, locked the car, and tucked the key fob into the zipper pocket of her tracksuit. She leaned against a trail marker and stretched her quads. A few deep lunges and she was ready to go.<br> <br>She set off at a brisk pace, quickly passing the dog walkers and bird enthusiasts who frequented the trail. Her muscles warmed. Her breathing steadied. She passed the first quarter-mile marker and felt the tension start to loosen.<br> <br>The routine had become her lifeline. She registered the familiar scent of loblolly pines, the spongy carpet of pine needles under her feet. She put her body through the paces, then her mind.<br> <br>It was Wednesday. She was halfway through the week, another daunting chain of days that started with paralyzing mornings in which she had to drag herself out of bed and force herself to shower, dress, and stand in front of the mirror to conceal the evidence of a fitful night. Then she faced the endless cycle of conference calls and meetings and inane conversations as the secret yearning built and built, culminating in the dreaded hour when it was time to go. Time to pack it in and head home to her perfectly located, gorgeously decorated, soul-crushingly empty house.<br> <br>But first, a run. Or a spin class. Or both. Anything to postpone the sight of that vacant driveway.<br> <br>Almost anything.<br> <br>Catie focused her attention on the narrow trail. Thirst stung her throat, but she tried to clear her mind. Rounding a bend, she noted the half-mile marker. She was making good time. Another curve in the path, and she came upon a couple jogging in easy lockstep. Twenty-somethings. At the end of the trail, and still they had a bounce in their stride. The woman smiled as they passed, and Catie felt a sharp pang of jealousy that drew her up short.<br> <br>She caught herself against a tree and bent over, gasping. Shame and regret formed a lump in her throat. She dug her nails into the bark and closed her eyes against the clammy onset of panic.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t think, Catie, Liam&#x2019;s voice echoed in her head. Be in the moment.<br> <br>God, she missed him. Liam was way too smart and way too intense, and he didn&#x2019;t know how to turn it off. And she liked that about him. So different from David.<br> <br>Liam never belittled her.<br> <br>He knew evil lurked in the world, and he faced it head-on, refusing to look away, even relishing the fight.<br> <br>Snick.<br> <br>Catie&#x2019;s head jerked up. She swung her gaze toward the darkening woods as awareness prickled to life inside her.<br> <br>The forest had gone quiet.<br> <br>No people, no dogs. Even the bird chatter had ceased. She glanced behind her, and a chill swept over her skin.<br> <br>Look, Catie. Feel what&#x2019;s around you.<br> <br>She did feel it. Cold and predatory and watching her.<br> <br>David would tell her she was paranoid. Delusional, even. But her senses were screaming.<br> <br>She glanced around, trying to orient herself on the trail. She wasn&#x2019;t that far in yet. She could still go back. She turned around and walked briskly, keeping her chin high and her gaze alert. Strong. Confident. She tried to look powerful and think powerful thoughts, but fear squished around inside her stomach, and she could feel it&#x2014;something sinister moving with her through the forest, watching her from deep within the woods. She&#x2019;d felt it before, and now it was back again, making her pulse quicken along with her strides.<br> <br>I am not crazy. I am not crazy. I am not crazy.<br> <br>But . . . what if David was right? And if he was right about this, could he be right about everything else, too?<br> <br>A sound, directly left. Catie halted. Her heart hammered. She peered into the gloom and sensed more than saw the shifting shadow.<br> <br>Recognition flickered as the shape materialized. With a rush of relief, she stepped forward. &#x201c;Hey, you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She noticed his hand.<br> <br>Her stomach plummeted. All her self-doubt vanished, replaced by a single electrifying impulse.<br> <br>Catie ran.<br> <br>SPECIAL AGENT TARA Rushing drove with the windows down, hoping the cold night air would snap her out of her funk. She felt wrung out. Like a dishrag that had been used to sop up filth, then squeezed and tossed aside.<br> <br>Usually, she loved the adrenaline rush. Kicking in a door, storming a room, taking down a bad guy&#x2014;anyone who&#x2019;d done it for real knew nothing compared. The high could last for hours, even through the paperwork, which was inevitably a lot.<br> <br>Typically, after a successful raid everyone was wired. The single agents would head out for a beer or three, sometimes going home together to burn off the energy. But tonight wasn&#x2019;t typical.<br> <br>After so many weeks of work and planning, she&#x2019;d expected to feel euphoric. Or at the very least satisfied. Instead she felt . . . nothing, really. Her dominant thought as she sped toward home was that she needed a shower. Not just hot&#x2014;volcanic. She&#x2019;d stand under the spray and scrub her skin raw and maybe get rid of some of the sickness clinging to her.<br> <br>Tara slowed her Explorer as the redbrick apartment building came into view. Her second-floor unit looked dark and lonely beside her neighbor&#x2019;s, where a TV glowed in the window and swags of Christmas lights still decorated the balcony.<br> <br>She rolled to a stop at the entrance and tapped in the access code. As the gate slid open, her phone vibrated in the cup holder. Tara eyed the screen: US GOV. She&#x2019;d forgotten to fill out some paperwork or turn in a piece of gear, or maybe they needed her to view another video.<br> <br>She felt the urge to throw her phone out the window. Instead she answered it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rushing.&#x201d;<br> <br>If she put enough hostility into her voice, maybe they wouldn&#x2019;t have the balls to call her back in.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dean Jacobs.&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t respond. Because of shock and because she couldn&#x2019;t think of a single intelligent thing to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;You make it home yet?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost. Sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jacobs was her SAC. She&#x2019;d had maybe four conversations with him in the three years since she&#x2019;d joined the Houston field office.<br> <br>&#x201c;They were just filling me in on the raid,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good work tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>The gate slid shut again as she stared through the windshield.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand you live north,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a matter I could use your help on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Something stirred inside her. Curiosity. Or maybe ambition. Whatever it was, she&#x2019;d take it. Anything was better than feeling numb.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need you to drive up to Cypress County. They&#x2019;ve got a ten-fifty off of Fifty-nine.&#x201d;<br> <br>His words surprised her even more than the midnight phone call. Tara knew all the 10-codes from her cop days, but dispatch had switched to plain language, and nobody used them anymore. A 10-50 was a deceased person.<br> <br>She cleared her throat. &#x201c;Okay. Any particular reason&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Take Martinez with you. She&#x2019;s got the location and she&#x2019;s on her way to your house, ETA ten minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tara checked her sports watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stay off your phone,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;You understand? I need complete discretion on this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And one more thing, Rushing.&#x201d;<br> <br>She waited.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let the yokels jerk you around.&#x201d;<br> <br>TARA DROVE NORTH on the highway hemmed in by towering trees. Barely an hour out of the city, she could already feel the change as they passed through the Pine Curtain. The night seemed thicker here, darker. She leaned forward, peering through the windshield at the moonless sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next exit,&#x201d; M.J. said, consulting the map on her phone. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for Dunn&#x2019;s Road.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tara glanced at the agent beside her. M. J. Martinez was a rookie, not even a year on the job.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, it&#x2019;s after one,&#x201d; M.J. said, looking at Tara. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m even awake right now. I&#x2019;ve had about three hours&#x2019; sleep in the past three days.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tara took the exit ramp. &#x201c;At least you got a shower. I smell like gym socks.&#x201d;<br> <br>M.J. didn&#x2019;t deny it. She&#x2019;d been involved in the raid, too, but from a planning perspective. In her former life, Martinez had been a tax attorney. She was smart and organized but green when it came to fieldwork. Tara had her HPD experience plus SWAT training under her belt, so she tended to be more hands-on.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; M.J. said. &#x201c;Dunn&#x2019;s Road. Hang a right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tara slowed, squinting at a sign marking a narrow road. Her headlights swept across tree trunks. The thicket gave way to jagged stumps, and Tara switched to brights. She thought the stumps looked ominous until the houses came into view, ramshackle wooden structures with sagging porches. Rusted septic tanks and dismantled cars littered the yards. Some of the homes were strangled by kudzu and had plywood covering the windows. None had seen a coat of paint in decades, unless you counted graffiti.<br> <br>They passed the charred carcass of a house, and M.J. looked at her. &#x201c;Meth lab?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good bet.&#x201d;<br> <br>The houses petered out, and so did the pavement. M.J. consulted her phone again because Tara&#x2019;s ancient Ford didn&#x2019;t have a GPS. The Blue Beast barely had a working heater. But the tires were new, and the four-wheel drive could handle anything. Tara changed the oil religiously so it wouldn&#x2019;t crap out on her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;re getting close,&#x201d; M.J. said, studying her screen. Instead of an address, Jacobs had provided her with GPS coordinates, along with the interesting factoid that FBI participation in this matter&#x2014;whatever it was&#x2014;had come at the request of the Honorable Wyatt H. Mooring, a federal judge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Veer left,&#x201d; M.J. instructed.<br> <br>Tara buzzed down the windows, filling the SUV with cold, damp air that smelled faintly of rotten eggs. It was cloudy out but no rain in the forecast, although that was yet another aspect of tonight that might not turn out as planned.<br> <br>&#x201c;We should be veering left again,&#x201d; M.J. said, &#x201c;after what looks like maybe a creek?&#x201d;<br> <br>They dipped down over a low-water bridge and heard the rush of water.<br> <br>&#x201c;Logging route,&#x201d; Tara said, noting the clear-cuts on either side. They pitched and bumped over the rutted road, passing a rickety cistern and another rusted septic tank. They rattled over a cattle guard and passed through a gap in a barbed-wire fence. Tara glanced around but didn&#x2019;t see any livestock, or any other creature for that matter. Clear-cuts gave way to trees again, and a sense of foreboding settled in her stomach as they moved deeper into the woods. The road narrowed until the tree trunks felt like they were closing in.<br> <br>She looked at M.J., wide-eyed and tense in the seat beside her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell are we doing here?&#x201d; M.J. asked, voicing the question in Tara&#x2019;s mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think Judge Mooring&#x2019;s from around here. Grew up in Dunn&#x2019;s Landing.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if that explained why their boss had sent them scrambling into the forest in the dead of the night.<br> <br>M.J. looked at her. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference between God and a federal judge?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;God doesn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s a federal judge.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tara smiled, for what seemed like the first time in days.<br> <br>A flicker of light caught her eye, a flash of white through the tree trunks. Her smile dropped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever this is, I think we found it.&#x201d;<br> <br>EMERGENCY VEHICLES LINED the side of the road&#x2014;sheriff&#x2019;s units, an ambulance, a red pickup truck with the emblem of a local fire department on the door. A khaki-clad deputy in a ten-gallon hat waved them down.<br> <br>Tara handed her ID through the window. &#x201c;Special Agent Tara Rushing, FBI.&#x201d;<br> <br>He examined her creds, then ducked his head down and peered into the window as M.J. held up her badge.<br> <br>He hesitated and then passed Tara&#x2019;s ID back. &#x201c;Pull around to the right there. Watch the barricades.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tara pulled around as instructed and parked beside a white crime-scene van.<br> <br>M.J. got out first, attracting immediate notice from the huddle of lawmen milling beside the red pickup. They looked her up and down, taking in her tailored gray slacks and crisp white button-down. Then again, maybe it was her curves they were noticing or the lush dark hair that cascaded down her back.<br> <br>Tara pushed open her door. Tall and willowy, she attracted stares, too, but for a different reason. She was still geared up from the raid in tactical pants and Oakley assault boots, with handcuffs tucked into her waistband and her Glock snug against her hip. Her curly brown hair was pulled back in a no-nonsense ponytail. She grabbed her FBI windbreaker from the backseat, and the men eyed her coolly as she zipped into it.<br> <br>Another deputy hustled over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s in charge of this crime scene?&#x201d; Tara asked, flashing her creds.<br> <br>He glanced at her ID, then her face. The man was short and stocky and smelled like vomit.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;d be Sheriff Ingram.&#x201d; He cast a glance behind him, where the light show continued deep in the woods.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a word with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>He darted a glance at M.J., then traipsed off down a narrow trail marked with yellow scene tape.<br> <br>The men continued to stare, but Tara ignored them and surveyed her surroundings. Someone had hooked a camping lantern to a nail on a nearby tree, illuminating a round clearing with a crude fire pit at the center. Old tires and tree stumps surrounded the pit, along with beer cans and cigarette butts. Someone had cordoned off the area with yellow tape and placed evidence markers near the cans and butts.<br> <br>Tara studied the ground outside the tape, where an alarming number of tire tracks crisscrossed the loamy soil.<br> <br>Another khaki uniform approached her, no hat this time. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sheriff Ingram?&#x201d;<br> <br>A brisk nod.<br> <br>&#x201c;Special Agent Tara Rushing.&#x201d; She showed her ID again, but he didn&#x2019;t look. &#x201c;And Special Agent Maria Jose Martinez.&#x201d;<br> <br>If he was surprised the FBI had shown up at his crime scene, he didn&#x2019;t show it.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here at the request of Judge Wyatt Mooring,&#x201d; M.J. added.<br> <br>He glanced at her, then back at Tara.<br> <br>With his brawny build and high-and-tight haircut, Sheriff Ingram looked like a Texas good old boy. But Tara didn&#x2019;t want to underestimate him. His eyes telegraphed intelligence, and he seemed to be carefully weighing his options. He stepped closer and rested his hands on his gun belt.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got a homicide.&#x201d; He nodded toward the woods. &#x201c;Female victim. No ID, no clothes, no vehicle. Long story short, I don&#x2019;t have a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hi...</p><h2>The Darkest Warrior (Lords of the Underworld, 14)</h2><p><strong>A searing Lords of the Underworld tale by </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author </strong><strong>Gena Showalter</strong><strong> featuring a beastly prince and the wife he will wage war to protect.<br><br>He is ice...</strong><br><br>Possessed by the demon of Indifference, Puck the Undefeated is unable to experience emotion without pain...until <em>her</em>.

It presents Jesus as the Messiah predicted in the Old Testament, but also as the Savior whose death was necessary for the salvation of mankind. The major focus of the gospel is the question of why Christ did not establish His kingdom at His first coming. The extended prophetic discourses recorded by Matthew provide the answers, and Dr. Walvoord gives detailed attention to these passages, especially the Olivet discourse (Matt. 24&#x2013;25).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Along with issues of date and authorship, Dr. Walvoord illuminates the genealogy and birth of Jesus, His early ministry, the Sermon on the Mount, His messianic miracles, controversies with religious leaders, and His death and resurrection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Biblical scholar Charles H. Dyer and writer Philip E. Rawley have revised and expanded this classic commentary by updating Scripture quotations with the English Standard Version (ESV), interacting with contemporary scholars on interpretive issues, and adding numerous insights into the geography of the land in which Jesus traveled and ministered.

Y. Evans-Wentz</p><p>What are fairies, those romantic and sometimes mischievous little people-- pixies, nixies, elves, fauns, brownies, dwarfs, leprechauns, and all the other forms of the daoine sidhe (fairy people)? Are they real? Folklorists say they are fragments of ancient religious beliefs; occultists call them nature spirits; the peasant tradition says they are fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved or bad enough to be lost. <p>Dr. Evans-Wentz is best known as the author-translator of "The Tibetan Book of the Dead", but his first love was this book, which presents a body of tradition and testimony about an elusive order of life that survives in the natural setting of wild and lonely places. He was not satisfied with merely formal study, but collected first-hand reports of fairies in Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Brittany, and faced up to the key questions avoided by other folklorists. Dr. Evans-Wentz, whose journeys led him from the haunts of fairyland to the wilderness of Tibet, opens a path for us to the luminous reality behind the traditions of folklore.</p>Evans-Wents, Jesus College Oxford.<br><br>W. Y. Evans-Wentz, an anthropologist, had interest in exploring the religious experience of mankind. His famous books in the present series include Tibetion Yoga and Secret Doctrines; The Tibetan Book of the Dead; and Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa.

His books, from the National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>Death at an Early Age</i> to his most recent, the critically acclaimed <i>Shame of the Nation</i>, are touchstones of the national conscience. First published in 1988 and based on the months the author spent among America&#x2019;s homeless, <i>Rachel and Her Children</i> is an unforgettable record of the desperate voices of men, women, and especially children caught up in a nightmarish situation that tears at the hearts of readers. With record numbers of homeless children and adults flooding the nation&#x2019;s shelters, <i>Rachel and Her Children</i> offers a look at homelessness that resonates even louder today.</p><p>Jonathan Kozol is the National Book Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>Death at an Early Age</i>, <i>Savage Inequalities</i>, <i>Amazing Grace</i>, and <i>The Shame of the Nation</i>. He has been working with children in inner-city schools for more than 40 years.Chapter 1 <br>A Mood of Resignation <br><br>It is possible to picture what a cheerful place this might have been at Christmas in the years when Woodrow Wilson was alive and Edward was the king of England and there was a tsar in Russia and fashionable musicians entertained the patrons in the ballroom of the Martinique Hotel. <br><br>A faded brochure from 1910 contains this information: &#x201c;The Hotel Martinique is located at the intersection of Broadway, Sixth Avenue and 32nd Street, and the plaza thus formed is termed Herald or Greeley Square. . . . One block east is Fifth Avenue, the great residential street of New York. Within a radius of three blocks are to be found the greatest of the city&#x2019;s retail stores, making it an ideal headquarters for shoppers. The best theaters are centered in this vicinity, and the two great Opera Houses are within easy walking distance.&#x201d; <br><br>Of the hotel&#x2019;s less formal restaurant, the brochure says this: &#x201c;The Gentlemen&#x2019;s Broadway Caf� is a veritable architectural gem.&#x201d; The walls and columns of Italian marble &#x201c;give to this room a richness which is completed by Pompeiian panels of unquestioned merit.&#x201d; <br><br>More elegant, it seems, was the Louis XVI dining room: &#x201c;The wainscoting and pillars are of Circassian walnut, enclosing panels of gold silk tapestry, producing a result described as the most refined public dining room in the city. No better evidence as to the quality of the cuisine can be given than that the restaurants are filled daily with a patronage of the very highest order. The food is invariably good, the wines of exceptional excellence, and the attendance unobtrusive.&#x201d; <br><br>The building is said to tower over all adjacent structures, &#x201c;furnishing views and a degree of light seldom secured in a city hotel. The sanitary precautions, plumbing, etc., are the most complete.&#x201d; Prices for rooms, according to the brochure, were $3.50 a day for room and bath, $6.00 and up for bedroom, bath, and parlor. <br>Prices are higher now. The patronage has changed. The Louis XVI dining room with its Circassian walnut and silk tapestry is gone. The Italian marble, however, is still there. The attendance remains unobtrusive. <br><br>December 20, 1985: Heavy chains secure the doorway of the former ballroom. They are removed to let a dozen people enter at a time. The line of people waiting for their lunch goes back about 200 feet. In the semi-darkness I see adults trying to keep children at their sides. Some of the kids are acting up, yelling, racing back and forth. A few are sitting on the floor. <br><br>This is the lunch program of the Coalition for the Homeless. Meals are served to residents five days a week. The program is organized by a young man named Tom Styron. He has enlisted the help of several women living in the building. Because I have come with him today, he has enlisted my help too. <br><br>One of the women sits by the door and checks the names of those who enter. Another woman helps to serve the food. The room is so cold that both keep on their coats. One has a heavy coat. The other has an unlined army jacket. She is very thin, a Puerto Rican woman, and is trembling. <br><br>I watch the people coming to the table. The children don&#x2019;t avert their eyes; nor do the women. It is the men who seem most scared: grown men in shabby clothes with nervous hands. They keep their eyes fixed on the floor. <br><br>The meal is good: turkey, potatoes, raisins, milk, an orange. It would be enough if it were one of three meals to be eaten in one day. For many, however, this will be the only meal. For an adult who has had no breakfast, this is at best a pacifier to fend off the hunger pangs until late afternoon. <br><br>Many of the children have on coats and sweaters. After they eat, some of them come back to the table, timidly. They ask if there are seconds. <br><br>There are no seconds. Several families at the back of the line have to be turned away. In my pocket I have one enormous apple that I bought in Herald Square for fifty cents. I give it to a tall Italian man. He doesn&#x2019;t eat the apple. He polishes it against his shirt. He turns it in his hand, rubs it some more. I watch him bring it back to where he&#x2019;s sitting with his children: one boy, two little girls. <br><br>The coalition buys the lunches from the New York Board of Education. The program therefore does not operate when school is not in session. Christmas, for this and other reasons, may be one of the most perilous and isolated times for families in the Martinique Hotel. Christmas is a difficult time for homeless families everywhere in the United States. <br><br>It will be 1986 before these people are assembled here again. As they get up to drift into the corridors and cubicles in which they will remain during the last week of the year, some of them stop to thank the people at the table. <br><br>The Martinique is not the worst of the hotels for homeless families in New York. Because its tenants have refrigerators (a very precious item for the mother of a newborn), it is considered by some residents to be one of the better shelters in the city. In visiting the Martinique, one tries to keep this point in mind; but it is, at first, not easy to imagine something worse. <br><br>Members of the New York City Council who visited the building in July of 1986 were clearly shaken: &#x201c;People passing by the hotel have no sense of the tragic dimensions of life inside. Upon entering the hotel, one is greeted by a rush of noise, made in large part by the many small children living there. These children share accommodations with a considerable cockroach and rodent population. The nearly 400 families housed at the Martinique are assisted by just seven HRA caseworkers, whose efforts to keep in touch with each family&#x2014;at least once each month&#x2014;often amount to no more than a note slipped under a door.&#x201d; <br><br>The report made by the city council offers this additional information: The average family is a mother with three children. Thirty-four percent of families became homeless after eviction by a landlord; 47 percent after being doubled up with other families; 19 percent after living in substandard housing. Fifty percent of heads of households report that they have once held full-time jobs. Seventy percent have seen at least five vacant units they could not afford or from which they have been turned away by landlords who did not want children or welfare recipients. <br><br>The city council describes a family living here more than one year: The family was originally forced to leave a city-owned apartment when one child, a daughter, became ill from lead-paint poison. In their next apartment the family&#x2019;s son became ill from lead poison. &#x201c;After six months of shuttling back and forth between hotels and EAUs,&#x201d; the city council writes, &#x201c;the family found itself at the Martinique, where lead paint peels from the ceiling of their room.&#x201d; <br><br>The city council makes this final observation: &#x201c;On the day of the committee&#x2019;s visit, just two elevators were operating. . . . The elevator on which the committee rode did not operate properly.&#x201d; At the time of my first visit, six months earlier, one elevator was in operation. <br><br>It is difficult to do full justice to the sense of hopelessness one feels on entering the building. It is a haunting experience and leaves an imprint on one&#x2019;s memory that is not easily erased by time or cheerful company. Even the light seems dimmer here, the details harder to make out, the mere geography of twisting corridors and winding stairs and circular passageways a maze that I found indecipherable at first and still find difficult to figure out. After fifty or sixty nights within this building, I have tried but cannot make a floor plan of the place. <br><br>Something of Dickens&#x2019; halls of chancery comes to my mind whenever I am wandering those floors. It is the knowledge of sorrow, I suppose, and of unbroken dreariness that dulls the vision and impairs one&#x2019;s faculties of self-location and discernment. If it does this to a visitor, what does it do to those for whom this chancery is home? <br><br>The city council tells us that the owners of the building are Bernard and Robert Sillins. The apparent manager (he is described as a consultant) is a gentleman, Mr. Tuccelli, whom some of the tenants view with fear. Mr. Tuccelli is consultant also to the nearby Prince George, but he maintains his office here. <br><br>The lobby is long, high-ceilinged, vast. On the right side, as one enters, is a sort of &#x201c;guard post,&#x201d; where a visitor must either be signed in by residents or else present good reason to be in the building. Even the best reason (meeting with the social workers) does not guarantee admission. Residents must be notified of waiting guests by guards. There are fifteen occupied floors above the lobby. There is no bell system. <br>In a recess on the left side of the lobby are two elevators and a winding flight of stairs. Again on the left, but farther back, is an alcove that contains a row of public phones. <br><br>On the right side of the lobby, opposite the phones, there is a registration area&#x2014;part of it original marble, part composed of plastic sheets and wooden slats. Though the wood and plastic give it the appearance of a temporary structure, it has been like this for several years. In this, it is suggestive of the total situation: a temporary shelter that has now been home to many children for two years and in some cases three. At the end of the lobby, on the left side, there are two more elevators and two flights of stairs. On the right side is a laundry room for use by residents. <br><br>On the first floor above the lobby there are two connected rooms, once used for banquets, one of which is used for the lunch program. A year from now, this room will have been painted and it will be heated. Two years from now, it will be divided to create a space for preschool. For now, it is a ghost of 1910. The other room is sometimes used for gift distribution (Christmas and Thanksgiving), tutoring, women&#x2019;s groups, and other similar activities run by the city or by volunteers. <br><br>Next to these is a third room in which crisis workers and a nurse have desks and phones. This room feels like a safe haven in a number of respects (emergencies of every kind are handled here) but chiefly because the people in this room include some of the most hard-working and devoted souls whom I have ever known. Two of the men who work here have become my friends. They are, I have no doubt, two of the most overburdened people in New York; but they dispense good cheer and absolutely unrestricted love to people in despair with a reserve of energy that I have rarely seen in twenty years of work among poor people. <br><br>I go out of my way to mention this because the general experience of homeless people with the city workers they confront is anything but benign. Harsh words will be heard within this book; I have no doubt that they are frequently deserved. But no one in the Martinique Hotel has spoken without gratitude of these extraordinary men. Robert Hayes spoke of the saints and martyrs in the homeless cause. Not all of them are radical activists or volunteers; some of them work for the city of New York and two at least are here. <br><br>If &#x201c;Crisis,&#x201d; as the families call this center, puts a visitor in mind of a safe haven, it is nearly the last haven one will find. Above and beyond are all those rooms, some as small as ten feet square, in which the residents do what they can to make it through the hours and the years. Although I have spent a great deal of time in recent years in some of the most desolate, diseased, and isolated areas of Haiti, I find the Martinique Hotel the saddest place that I have been in my entire life. Why it should seem worse than Haiti I cannot explain. <br><br>What is life like for children in this building? <br><br>For many the question may be answered briefly, as their lives will be extremely short. The infant mortality rate in the hotel is twenty-five per thousand, over twice the national rate and higher even than the rate in New York&#x2019;s housing projects.* The term used by health professionals for the endangered status of an infant&#x2014;a child of low birth weight, for example, or a child who does not gain weight after birth&#x2014;is &#x201c;failure to thrive.&#x201d; We will learn more of the implications of this term in speaking with the residents of the hotel. There is one nurse present (daytime hours only) to meet all the health needs of the people in the building. <br><br>What of the children who manage to survive? Those who do not fail to thrive in their first hours of life will be released from the obstetric wards to rooms devoid of light, fresh air, or educative opportunities in early years. Play is a part of education too; they will not have much opportunity for play. Their front doors will give out upon a narrow corridor; their windows on a courtyard strewn with glass, or on the street, or on the wall of an adjacent wing of the hotel. The Empire State Building is two blocks away; if they are well situated they may have a lot of time to gaze at that. They are children who will often have no opportunity for Head Start. Many will wait for months before they are assigned to public school. Those who do get into school may find themselves embarrassed by the stigma that attaches to the &#x201c;dirty baby,&#x201d; as the children of the homeless are described by hospitals and sometimes perceived by their schoolteachers. Whether so perceived or not, they will feel dirty. Many, because of overflowing sewage in their bathrooms, will be dirty and will bring the smell of destitution with them into class. <br><br>They are children who write letters each December to a Santa Claus who sometimes has no opportunity to answer. If their mothers or social workers are attentive, they may get a Christmas present from the fire department or the New York Daily News. They are children who receive used clothes from volunteers, emergency food from crisis workers, quarters sometimes from pedestrians in Herald Square. <br>If the children are awake at night they may hear their mothers pray. Some of these women pray a great deal more than other people I have met. There are Bibles in most of their rooms. Many, however, cannot read. <br><br>By December 22, two nights after I arrive in New York City, I have met about a dozen families living in the Martinique. I&#x2019;ve been told that people here would be reluctant to confide in someone they don&#x2019;t know. Perhaps they ought to be reluctant. But this doesn&#x2019;t prove to be the case. I ask some questions to begin each conversation. How did you end up here? How do you manage? What do you long for? What may happen next? The mechanical matters are answered quickly. People in pain move to the heart of things more rapidly than I expect. <br><br>In a small room on the ninth floor there is a mood of resignation and a smell of unwashed clothes. There is no place to sit except the floor or beds. Gwen sits with her children on one of the beds. The baby is two. The older child is eight. I sit on the floor. There is another bed next to the window.</p><h2>Ammonite</h2><p><b>Winner of the Lambda and Tiptree Awards</b> � <b>&#x201c;A knockout . . .

Marguerite Angelica Taishan is an anthropologist who realizes this phenomena and makes the decision to give herself up to the planet to uncover its mysteries.This first novel is one of the best books I've ever acquired and edited. What was most impressive about it was the minimal amount of editorial work and copyediting work it needed--it arrived in our offices in publishable form and just needed a few editorial comments from me, and a few commas and such from the copyeditor, to send it on its way. For a first novel, that's extremely rare (as well as extremely enjoyable for the editor!). Nicola Griffith has been a great writer from the start. Even with the pulpy cover we put on the book when we first published it, featuring what seemed to be a metallic jellybean rather than a spaceship, <b>Ammonite</b> went on to win a Lambda Award and the Tiptree Award for best novel dealing with issues of gender. It got rave reviews from Ursula K. Le Guin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and other renowned writers, and a great review in the New York Times as well.

In the late 1980s I wrote <i>Tender Trap</i> and <i>Aftermath</i> featuring Denver and Colton McLean&#x2014;two brothers returning to their family ranch after years away, confronting the secrets left behind. I&#x2019;m thrilled that they&#x2019;re now available in one volume, with a striking new cover and title, <i>Backlash</i> . . .</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The ranch country of Montana is beautiful, unforgiving, and for Colton and Denver McLean, filled with a whole lot of bad memories. It&#x2019;s been seven years since a fire claimed their parents&#x2019; lives and drove both brothers away. Now their uncle&#x2019;s death has brought them back to a place where loyalty and love runs deep&#x2014;but so do grudges. <br> &nbsp;<br> Suspicion still swirls about what caused that tragic fire. It created a rift between Denver and the foreman&#x2019;s daughter, Tessa Kramer. Now Tessa hopes to buy the ranch, if Denver and Colton will agree to sell, but the property is beset by problems. A prized stallion disappears. Other horses start falling sick. Someone seems determined to disrupt&#x2014;or destroy&#x2014;the McLean family&#x2019;s legacy by any means necessary. And finding answers will turn this homecoming into a time of reckoning with enemies past and present . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>I hope you enjoy coming back to Montana with me!</b></p><p><b>LISA JACKSON</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than seventy-five novels, including <i>Liar, Liar;</i> <i>One Last Breath; You Will Pay; After She&#x2019;s Gone;</i> <i>Close to Home;</i> <i>Tell Me; Deserves to Die;</i> <i>You Don&#x2019;t Want to Know;</i> <i>Running Scared;</i> and <i>Shiver</i>.

In his latest book, <i>Look: A Practical Guide for Improving Your Observational Skills</i>, Gilmore introduces the metaphor of ''six looking glasses.'' Each looking glass represents a particular skill to master in order to enhance the way we look at the world.<br><br> The six skills include binoculars, bifocals, magnifying glass, microscope, rose-colored glasses, and blindfold looking. Each looking glass provides an observational lens through which to see the world differently. This framework will help its users to:<br><br><ul> <li>See the big picture</li> <li>Overcome personal bias</li> <li>Pinpoint significance</li> <li>Better scrutinize numerous details</li> <li>Uncover potential opportunities</li> <li>See what's in the mind's eye</li></ul><br> These varying perspectives offer myriad practical applications: They can help any executive, manager, or designer more richly observe customer behavior, philanthropists and policy makers more keenly identify human needs, and anyone else interested in innovative thinking to first ground their ideation in practical observation. <br><br> Gilmore helps readers grasp the Six Looking Glasses by including helpful everyday examples and practice exercises throughout. Put into practice, this method of looking will help you see the world with new eyes.</p><p>Jim Gilmore is co-founder of Strategic Horizons LLP, based in Aurora, Ohio. He is a Batten fellow and adjunct lecturer at the Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia, where he teaches a course on the Experience Economy. Gilmore is a visiting lecturer in Apologetics at Westminster Seminary California, where he teaches a course on cultural hermeneutics. He also teaches a design course at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.<p> Gilmore is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an alumnus of Procter &amp; Gamble, and, before co-founding Strategic Horizons LLP, was head of CSC Consulting's Process Innovation practice. <i>Look</i> is his third book. His other books include the highly influential, <i>The Experience Economy: Work Is Theatre &amp; Every Business a Stage and Authenticity: What Consumers Really Want</i>.</p>''Jim Gilmore teaches us that something as seemingly simple as looking can be crucial for success in any field.

Take a good look at <i>Look</i>.''<br> --<b>Lee Knight</b>, Founder &amp; CEO of Exhibitor Media Group <br><br> ''Once again, Jim Gilmore challenges organizations to find unique ways to drive innovation. The power of observation has long been extolled but rarely emphasized in business. Jim's latest work will make all of us view our businesses through different lenses&#x2014;and literally open our eyes.''<br> --<b>David Peckinpaugh</b>, President of Maritz Global Events <br><br> ''Our culture is increasingly distracted. With eyes glued to screens, we are often oblivious to the people beside us and the places we inhabit. The ancient rebuke of God could certainly apply to our generation, 'You have eyes but you do not see.' Our failure to recognize the world around us is especially dangerous for those seeking innovative ideas because, as Gilmore reminds us, what we see determines what we think and do. Seeing differently is one of Gilmore's specialties. He is one of the most gifted observers I know. Five minutes with him will convince you that ordinary objects and processes are overflowing with untapped potential&#x2014;from airline seats to food preparation&#x2014;if we could just learn to see them with new eyes. In Look he shares his simple but profound observational methods using Six Looking Glasses.

George Vecsey casts a fresh eye on the game, illuminates its foibles and triumphs, and performs a marvelous feat: making a classic story seem refreshingly new. </b><br><br> <i>Baseball</i> is a narrative of America&#x2019;s can-do spirit, in which stalwart immigrants such as Henry Chadwick could transplant cricket and rounders into the fertile American culture and in which die-hard unionist baseballers such as Charles Comiskey and Connie Mack could eventually become the tightfisted avatars of the game&#x2019;s big-money establishment. It&#x2019;s a celebration of such underdogs as a rag-armed catcher turned owner named Branch Rickey and a sure-handed fielder named Curt Flood, both of whom flourished as true great men of history. But most of all, <i>Baseball </i>is a testament to the unbreakable bond between our nation&#x2019;s pastime and the fans, who&#x2019;ve remained loyal through the fifty-year-long interdict on black athletes, the Black Sox scandal, franchise relocation, and the use of performance-enhancing drugs by some major stars. <br><br> Reverent, playful, and filled with Vecsey&#x2019;s charm, <i>Baseball </i>begs to be read in the span of a rain-delayed doubleheader, and so enjoyable that, like a favorite team&#x2019;s championship run, one hopes it never ends.<br> <b><br> &#x201c;Vecsey possesses a journalist&#x2019;s eye for detail and a historian&#x2019;s feel for the sweep of action.

Among the Cardinals' entourage was Stan Musial, about to turn thirty-eight, old by baseball standards, but still exhibiting his characteristic smile and convoluted batting stance.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the city of Tokyo was a seventeen-year-old prospect named Sadaharu Oh, the son of a Chinese noodle shop operator and a Japanese mother. Oh was already Japan's best-known high school player. His batting coach, Tetsuharu Kawakami, strongly suggested that Oh adapt Musial's coiled stance. &#x201c;Hitting is with your hip, not with your hand,&#x201d; said Kawakami, who had won five batting titles in Japan.<br> &nbsp;<br> With the obstinacy of a seventeen-year-old, Oh declined. Several years later, on the brink of failure that was partially self-induced through his excesses and hardheadedness, Oh would submit to his guru. With the hope of salvaging his career, Oh would accept an even more idiosyncratic posture&#x2014;&#x201c;the flamingo stance,&#x201d; the Japanese would call it. He would raise his front leg, the right one, forcing his weight and power to his back foot. The new stance had its roots in the twisted Musial position.<br> &nbsp;<br> That earnest trip in 1958 was regarded as something of a failure by Musial, who hit only two home runs for the adoring Japanese fans. &#x201c;I was tired, worn out after the regular season,&#x201d; Musial would recall thirty years later. &#x201c;I'm sorry they couldn't have seen me earlier.&#x201d; Yet the trip by the Cardinals would help produce the greatest home run hitter in the history of baseball, as Sadaharu Oh would eventually hit 868 home runs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Years later, Musial and Oh would meet, shake hands, and bow to each other, left-handed sluggers from opposite shores, comrades in unorthodoxy.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is the beauty of baseball. Everything is connected, either by statistic or anecdote or theory or history or the infallible memory of a fan who was there, who saw it, who can look it up. It is possible to sit in the ballpark (not the stadium, not the arena, but the ballpark, a homey title claimed only by baseball) and, during the process of one game, watch several overlapping games, overlapping generations and histories, all at once. The grandson, if he is not looking around for the hot dog vendor, may see Ichiro Suzuki slap a double into the corner. The grandfather may be thinking of how Stan Musial used to smack doubles just like that.<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> The American playwright John Guare is known for his enduring play Six Degrees of Separation, based on a theory that there are no more than six layers between any two people on the planet. Guare was not talking about baseball, but he could have been. The so-called American game has existed in a straight and highly detectable line since the 1840s&#x2014;and backward into earlier times on other continents.<br> The game is perpetuated in raucous living museums, many of them in the center of cities, on a continent just beginning to have some history to it. Some cities have been playing other cities for a long time now, by American standards. These old places contain triumphs and resentments, nowhere near the rivalries of the old city-states of Europe, but the beginning of history, at the very least.<br> &nbsp;<br> The hearts of the fans contain memories of something horrible that happened in 1908, or 1940, or maybe even last week. No other American sport has so many ancient joys and sorrows. It sounds overbearingly cutesy when sportswriters in Boston refer to the Red Sox as Ye Olde Towne Team, yet in that marvelous October of 2004 the Sox labored under a cloud of communal frustration dating back to 1918 when Babe Ruth pitched the Sox to a championship, and was soon sold to the New York Yankees. When the Sox went on their memorable eight-game romp in 2004, you could hear the brass band of a century earlier: a local rock group had resurrected &#x201c;Tessie,&#x201d; the anthem of the very first World Series of 1903. Base-ball's history echoed in vibrant Fenway Park as well as the crooked streets and anarchic traffic of Boston.<br> &nbsp;<br> Baseball fans know these links, discuss them in dens and bars and playgrounds and even at contemporary ballparks&#x2014;that is, when they can be heard above the god-awful din of the modern sound system. These memories are much more than trivia or statistics; they are a way of keeping history alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sport has a timeless feel to it, as if it has always been here. That is because each game is unfettered by the tyranny of a stopwatch, as anybody will attest who has ever held car keys in hand, poised in an exit portal, only to witness a nine-inning game suddenly lurch into extra innings. I am thinking here of a marathon I once covered as a young reporter in 1962, the first year of Casey Stengel's Amazing Mets, who very quickly established themselves as the Worst Team in the History of Baseball, capital letters and all. On a chilly spring night, the Mets played the equally wretched Chicago Cubs in extra innings. The game seemed interminable&#x2014; refreshment stands were closed down, children were fast asleep on their parents' laps, and fans were beginning to dread getting up for work in the morning. As I sat in the stands to savor the mood of this horrendous new team so gloriously born in New York, I heard one fan say to another, &#x201c;I hate to go&#x2014;but I hate to stay.&#x201d; Those words seemed to sum up the morbid compulsion that keeps fans in their seats, quite unable to leave this silly game.<br> &nbsp;<br> The absence of a clock is matched by the perfection of the calendar. The season begins in the hopefulness of early spring and it flourishes in the heat of the summer and then it breaks hearts in the nippy evenings of late October.<br> &nbsp;<br> Plus, they play it every day. No other sport in the world can match baseball for constant adventures, new results. All around the world, at every moment, there are compelling sports events, many of them presented on multiple television channels&#x2014;soccer goals rocketing into the net in Rio, basketballs dunked in Shanghai, nifty putts in Madrid, dazzling backhands in Melbourne, gaudy touchdowns in Dallas, vehicles whizzing across finish lines in Monte Carlo or Daytona. But only baseball summons the same cast of characters to return, a few hours after the end of the previous game.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let's play two,&#x201d; chirped Ernie Banks of the Cubs, who had often played two or even three games a day in the Negro Leagues and became an icon in the major leagues for his celebration of the daily ritual.<br> &nbsp;<br> No other sport has this endurance. American football players must go back into their bunkers to receive six days of drills before their bodies heal enough to play again. Likewise, basketball, soccer, and hockey players cannot play every day. Yet barring injuries, baseball regulars are expected to start in 140 or 150 games out of a total of 162, with starting pitchers expected to throw once every five days.<br> &nbsp;<br> The result of this regularity is a delightful soap opera that airs virtually seven days a week. The player who muffed a fly ball last night or stole a base or made an incredible catch must go back out there today, in front of fans who reward him or revile him for events only a few hours old.<br> &nbsp;<br> These daily games seep into the consciousness of citizens who insist they have stopped paying attention to baseball. People say they became disillusioned at their favorite team's defection to another town or the serial labor shutdowns of the past generation, and they claim they would rather watch pro football or stock cars going around in circles, or whatever. They declare they are turned off by high salaries as well as the steroid generation that saw bulked-up sluggers whacking home runs at an unprecedented rate, but the reality is that baseball has survived gambling plots, outlaw leagues, racial segregation, depressions, world wars, the early death of a stunning number of its heroes, financial failures of teams, inept ownerships, the bad taste of its sponsors and networks, blundering commissioners, inroads by other sports. It endures.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Culture of the Teutons: Volumes 1 and 2</h2><p>The Culture of the Teutons by Vilhelm Gr�nbech is out-of-print and in the public domain.

Today&#39;s massively scaling startups - which rapidly grow to millions of users and billions in valuation - do not sell a product or service. Instead, they build a platform on which others can create and exchange value. The many manifestations of the platform business model - social media, the peer economy, cryptocurrencies, APIs and developer ecosystems, the Internet of things, crowdsourcing models, and many others - are becoming increasingly relevant. Yet, most new platform ideas fail because the business design and growth strategies involved in building platforms are not well understood. Platform Scale lays out a structured approach to designing and growing a platform business model and addresses the key factors leading to the success and failure of these businesses. Six core concepts for successful platform business model design 1. Re-imagine your business for platform scale The mechanism by which these new business models scale so rapidly. Understand the shift in thinking needed to manage businesses with platform scale and the impact of network effects, virality, behavior design and data. &#34;We are not in the business of building software. We are in the business of enabling interactions.&#34; 2. Leverage interaction-first design How detailed consideration around designing the producer-consumer core interaction is critical for building business models that leverage platform scale. &#34;The design of the platform business model involves the design of a core interaction followed by the design of an open infrastructure that will enable and govern this interaction.&#34; 3. Build cumulative value and minimize interaction failure Know the key managerial decisions to focus on while managing platform scale businesses, all geared towards maximizing the ability of these businesses to enable interactions by scaling producer participation and minimizing interaction failure. &#34;Platform scale is achieved by maximizing the repeatability and efficiency of the platform&#39;s core interaction.&#34; 4. Solve chicken and egg problems Platform business models face an all too familiar catch-22 chicken and egg problem on the way to scaling. This can be overcome by designing the conditions for sparking interactions. &#34;The solution to the chicken-and-egg problem requires a bait that can break the vicious cycle of no activity.&#34; 5. Design viral engines Understand the drivers of viral growth in a world of networks and apply the viral canvas design-first approach to viral growth. &#34;Virality is a business design problem, not a marketing or engineering effort. It requires design before optimization.&#34; 6. Account for reverse network effects Consider the counter view on platform scale and be on the lookout for conditions where scale can be detrimental to platform businesses. &#34;The goal of platform scale is to ensure the simultaneous scaling of quantity and quality, of interactions.&#34; Platform Scale is a maker&#39;s guide for entrepreneurs, innovators and educators looking to understand and implement the inner workings of highly scalable platform business models.</p><p>Sangeet Paul Choudary is a widely published researcher, industry keynote speaker and global CXO advisor on platform business models to high growth startups and Fortune 500 companies.

He frequently appears in literature as a great warlord and pious crusading figure. In 778, the rearguard of Charlemagne's retreating army was ambushed and defeated at the battle of Roncevaux. This became the inspiration for songs and poems celebrating deeds of valour in the face of overwhelming odds, through the character of Charlemagne's nephew (the imaginary) Roland. <em>The Song of Roland</em> is the most stirring and moving epic poem of the European Middle Ages, offering a particularly heady mixture of history, legend, and poetry. <br><br>Presented here in a lively and idiomatic new translation, the Song of Roland offers fascinating insights into medieval ideas about heroism, manhood, religion, race, and nationhood which were foundational for modern European culture. <em>The Song of Roland</em> is accompanied here by two other medieval French epics about Charlemagne, both of which show him to be a far more equivocal figure than that portrayed by the <em>Roland: the Occitan Daurel and Beton</em>, in which he is a corrupt and avaricious monarch; and the <em>Journey of Charlemagne to Jerusalem and Constantinople</em>, which gives the heroes of the <em>Roland</em> a comic makeover.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> For over 100 years <em>Oxford World's Classics</em> has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p><br><strong>Simon Gaunt</strong> taught in Cambridge for 10 years before taking up his current position at King's College London in 1998.

And yet there has never been a comprehensive field guide to this splendid and elusive avifauna. Until now. <br>The carefully vetted text and images are the first to cover the full range of bird life in this vast and varied country. The more than 1800 up-to-date accounts treat the Yellow-nosed Albatross to the Sombre Hummingbird, the Ash-throated Gnat-eater to the Black-bellied Whistling-Duck, Nighthawks and Jacamars to Motmots, Puffbirds, and Peppershrikes. They are all here--every species and many subspecies found in each region of Brazil--with special attention given to the 218 Brazilian endemics. The book is laid out so that the illustrations sit across from the commentary and the distribution maps, so it is easy to use. Also, the author uses short-hand notation throughout, to make the book compact and easy to carry when in the field. For each bird, the scientific, English, and Portuguese name are given as well as detailed information on measurement; identifying features; habitat; voice, song, and call. Distribution maps show the range for each species, also indicating seasonality and occurrence, essential for finding and identifying specific birds. From the equatorial North to the tropics, the introductory paragraphs set the stage in describing Brazil's varied biogeography, climate, geomorphology, and natural vegetation. A list of protected areas of Brazil, information on relevant national and international organizations, a bibliography and further references, and an English-Portuguese dictionary of frequently used terms enhance the user-friendly qualities. <br>Anyone wishing to fully explore the fabulously varied bird life of Brazil will find this light-weight, easy-to-use, attractive guide an invaluable field companion.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ber van Perlo</strong> is the author and illustrator of numerous popular field guides including <em>Birds of Eastern Africa, Birds of Southern Africa, Birds of Western and Central Africa</em>, and <em>Birds of Mexico and Central America</em>. Until 1991 he worked as a geographer and physical planner for the Dutch National Forest Service.<br><br>"Van Perlo's book can be considered the best bird field guide produced so far for Brazil due to a combination of its light weight and small size, thorough coverage of species, and generally good quality and useful plates, text, and range maps."--<em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"This latest publication of a field guide to Brazilian birds moves the bar a couple of notches above the several existing recent attempts, all of which have been published in Brazil. It is certainly the single most useful book for field identification of Brazil's enormous and complex birdlife currently available. If you live in or soon plan to go birding in Brazil, buy this book and make the best of it; it will help you immensely!"--<em>AUK</em><p></p><br>"Any birdwatcher planning a trip to Brazil needs <em>A Field Guide to the Birds of Brazil</em>. It is the first modern, in-depth guide to Brazil's birds and offers information on size, call and identifying features for nearly 2,000 birds. Clear color drawings pack a portable dictionary including an English-Portuguese dictionary especially for birders and some 1,700 species-distribution maps. Simply invaluable."--<em>Midwest Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Would I suggest to a traveling birder to buy one? Absolutely."--<em>Indiana Audubon Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"This is now the essential field guide companion that one would need when visiting Brazil."--Idaho Birding Blog<p></p><br>"Highly recommended. The book will be useful to professional and amateur ornithologists, both in Brazil and bordering countries."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Signing the Body Poetic: Essays on American Sign Language Literature</h2><p>This unique collection of essays, accompanied by a pioneering DVD, at last brings a dazzling view of the literary, social, and performative aspects of American Sign Language to a wide audience. The book presents the work of a renowned and diverse group of deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing scholars who examine original ASL poetry, narrative, and drama. The DVD showcases the poems and narratives under discussion in their original form, providing access to them for hearing non-signers for the first time. Together, the book and DVD provide new insight into the history, culture, and creative achievements of the deaf community while expanding the scope of the visual and performing arts, literary criticism, and comparative literature.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a startlingly original collection, challenging readers to think well beyond normative contours of the literary text toward a living art of the embodied sign. A significant contribution to literary, performance, and Deaf culture studies, <i>Signing the Body Poetic</i> will make us all see differently.&#x201d;&#x2015;Della Pollock, editor of <i>Remembering: Oral History Performance</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Signing the Body Poetic</i> is both a book and an event&#x2015;a long-anticipated work that questions and recasts some of our most embedded definitions of poetry and other language arts. The work of several generations of signing poets has made a place for gesture that eliminates once and for all the hegemony of the spoken word as the single determinant of poetry and language performance. That is the accomplishment analyzed and celebrated in these pages and in the accompanying DVD that clearly shows the work at hand.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jerome Rothenberg, coeditor of <i>Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Modern and Postmodern Poetry</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Signing the Body Poetic</i> is the first major scholarly work to celebrate and theorize American Sign Language artistic expression, ranging from poetry to theater and film. A must for anyone interested in contemporary poetry, drama, or literary theory.&#x201d;&#x2015;Lennard J. Davis, editor of <i>The Disability Studies Reader </i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Signing the Body Poetic</i> brings new and productive dimensions to the phrase &#x2018;body of literature.&#x2019; This impressive collection details the aesthetics, the epistemological importance, and the cultural life of American Sign Language literature in clear, accessible prose. Close analyses of key texts in/as performances are enhanced by the accompanying DVD, itself an invaluable resource. This collection will be useful for scholars and general readers interested in the complexities of literary production and reception.&#x201d;&#x2015;Judith Hamera, author of <i>Opening Acts</i> and editor of <i>The Sage Handbook of Performance Studies</i><br><br>&#x201c;This collection is as unique as ASL, merging linguistics, nonverbal communication, and performance both in the content of the chapters and in its form (text and DVD). Unlocking the performative dimension of ASL, it merges disciplines, communicative forms, and channels while demonstrating that our ability to communicate is not limited by the organs we use to do so but only by our ability to perform.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michael L.

Han privately thought that if Ubbel had been in charge, the Empire would have encompassed one of the smaller skyscrap�ers on Coruscant instead of half the galaxy.<br><br>&#x201c;I can take them faster than the squad can!&#x201d; Han shouted.<br><br>&#x201c;Negative, negative, Onyx Nine, return to formation!&#x201d;<br><br>Han actually liked Onyx 2, his friend Cadet Lyttan Dree. The number of other cadets who liked him was frankly diminish�ing. His natural charm always drew them in...but then most people would quickly figure out that being close to him would probably reduce their chances for advancement. Dree, or Onyx 2, managed to be a good pilot, Han&#x2019;s friend, and still fol�low the rules. Han had always meant to ask him how he did that, and now he might never get the chance.<br><br>Han peeled off from the formation and chased the Headhunt�ers down, feeling much freer now that he could fly where he wanted to and not worry about the others in formation. In the�ory he could understand the need for a formation, but in prac�tice he always preferred to worry only about himself and his own ship.<br><br>He accelerated, watching the raiders flank Onyx 2 as he tried to outmaneuver them. Han&#x2019;s helmet squawked again, and he turned down the audio as Onyx Leader was shouting at him to return to formation. Then his droid started fussing at him.<br><br>Imperial droids were the worst. The White Worms hadn&#x2019;t had much use for droids, so Han hadn&#x2019;t grown up with them behind doors, underfoot, and always politely, infuriatingly, tell�ing him how wrong he was.<br><br>His ship&#x2019;s intelligence, MGK-300, was such a droid. It thought that since it was integrated directly into his ship, it knew more about the ship than he did.<br><br>He&#x2019;d already long since had enough of MGK&#x2019;s so-called guidance, but it still beeped furiously at him that they were making the squadron weaker because of his actions.<br><br>Han ignored it. If the droid wasn&#x2019;t telling him something was wrong with the ship, he didn&#x2019;t see a need to listen to it.<br><br>He got one of the raiders in his sights and fired, nearly miss�ing, but clipping a wing. The ships separated, one keeping up with Onyx 2 and one turning to pursue Han.<br><br>Now he saw the point of the squadron formation. Han wheeled and turned, heading back, and met head-on his own fellow ca�dets flying toward them. He ducked to slide under them and they fired. He cheered them on, but then felt the ship heave under him as something behind him exploded.<br><br>His Infiltrator went into a spin. Han fought for control, try�ing to tune out the squeals and beeps coming from behind his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I know we lost the reverse thrusters! Thank you!&#x201d; The ship started to spin, the universe whirling madly around him, the Star Destroyer&#x2019;s docking bay a rapidly moving target.<br><br>MGK beeped what Han knew was standard emergency pro�tocol at this point&#x2014;which was essentially giving up. He shook his head. &#x201c;Not ejecting! I can make it back to the docking bay!&#x201d;<br><br>The droid made known its firm disagreement, beeping and booping faster and faster as it began to panic.<br><br>These machines were distracting, irritating, and useless. How did anyone fly with this nagging going on? &#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; he asked, flipping an emergency switch to power down the droid. MGK couldn&#x2019;t distract him now, and he could finally focus.<br><br>As if the droid were trying to get the last word in, the control panel sparked and spit when he touched the switches. Pain flared in his hand and he yelped, shaking it. Had MGK done it on purpose? He couldn&#x2019;t tell. It was pointless to wonder, be�cause the docking bay was suddenly much, much closer.<br>He struggled to maintain control and decelerate. At the last possible moment, he yanked the control yoke upward, managing to slip through the artificial atmosphere of the docking bay cleanly, without clipping any of the sides&#x2014;which Han thought was pretty impressive. His ship hit the floor and bounced, ca�reening him into three tethered TIE fighters. His chin hit the control panel and he saw more stars, wondering briefly if he had flown straight through the ship and back into space. Then he heard the alarms and remembered where he was.<br> No one was impressed with the fact that he&#x2019;d saved Onyx 2.<br> &nbsp;<br>---<br> &nbsp;<br><br>Commodore Almudin&#x2019;s round face seemed to eclipse the rest of the tribunal. Other high-ranking important types were there, but Han could only see the ridiculous round face, even as he struggled to take the man seriously. The commodore outranked him (actually, everyone on the tribunal outranked him), and rumor had it that he&#x2019;d had an amazing flight record in his day. But right now he flew a desk and had the exciting job of sen�tencing real pilots in military tribunals.<br><br>Han&#x2019;s chin still throbbed from the quick work the medical droid had made of his gash, and he ignored the other aches from the crash as he stood straight.<br><br>But the officer&#x2019;s face really was irritating.<br><br>The other officers on the tribunal, two women and a man, looked both bored and annoyed, as if in their minds Han was already sentenced to death and they were just waiting for lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Cadet Solo,&#x201d; the commodore said, like he had before, with that tone of less than disgust, &#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t decide if you&#x2019;re brave or stupid.&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugged. &#x201c;I like to think I&#x2019;m a little of both, sir.&#x201d; He paused. He could never get the ranks right. Was this man a moff? He&#x2019;d better cover all of his options. &#x201c;I mean, Moff.&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t change. &#x201c;Sir Moff.&#x201d;<br><br>That finally broke him. He scowled at Han and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s &#x2018;Commodore,&#x2019; and if you think having a smart-ass attitude is the way to go here, you&#x2019;re sorely mistaken.<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you tell us what allegedly happened here?&#x201d; he continued, indicating a screen that had lit up. It was flanked by two Imperial guards, Lieutenants Tag Greenley and Bink Otauna. Once upon a time, Han had attempted to befriend them, but they turned out to be such colossal screwups, Han started to avoid them before they got him or themselves killed. Still, he needed all the friends he could get. He gave them a little wave and a grin. They looked back at him wryly and said nothing.<br><br>The screen lit up and Han saw his own ship, leaving forma�tion to pursue. He felt a surge of pride as he always did, seeing from the outside how free he looked. He realized he was just admiring himself, and he cleared his throat and pointed in the general direction of where Onyx 2 was being pursued.<br><br>&#x201c;Onyx Two was flanked by Headhunters.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d reported all of this. He had no idea why they needed his comments again since he&#x2019;d already given them all the information in his report. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d followed Command&#x2019;s directive and returned to forma�tion instead of going after &#x2019;em, he&#x2019;d be dead now.&#x201d;<br><br>This tribunal was ridiculous. Couldn&#x2019;t they see that he&#x2019;d saved their second in command?<br><br>&#x201c;There is no place for maverick heroics in his Emperor&#x2019;s navy.&#x201d;<br><br>Han held his hands up, as if fending off praise. &#x201c;Trust me, I&#x2019;ve got no interest in being a hero, Commodore, what I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The commodore cut him off abruptly. &#x201c;Well, congratulations. You&#x2019;re not one. This tribunal, me in particular, finds you guilty of disobeying a direct order, and you are hereby reassigned to the infantry. Report for immediate transfer to Mimban.&#x201d;<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t getting kicked out. Relief flooded him. He smiled. &#x201c;Okay. I thought it was gonna be way worse.&#x201d; He cocked his head and inquired, &#x201c;And roughly, when do you think I&#x2019;ll be fly�ing again?&#x201d;<br>Commodore Almudin smiled, and there was nothing friendly about it. &#x201c;Oh, we&#x2019;ll have you flying in no time.&#x201d;</p><h2>God&#x2019;s Power to Change (Transformation)</h2><p>Fear of rejection.

In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan declared the GOP the party of "family values" and promised to keep government out of Americans' lives. Again and again, historians have sought to explain the nation's profound political realignment from the 1960s to the 2000s, five decades that witnessed the fracturing of liberalism and the rise of the conservative right. The award-winning historian Robert O. Self is the first to argue that the separate threads of that realignment&#x2015;from civil rights to women's rights, from the antiwar movement to Nixon's "silent majority," from the abortion wars to gay marriage, from the welfare state to neoliberal economic policies&#x2015;all ran through the politicized American family.</p><p>Based on an astonishing range of sources, <i>All in the Family</i> rethinks an entire era. Self opens his narrative with the Great Society and its assumption of a white, patriotic, heterosexual man at the head of each family. Soon enough, civil rights activists, feminists, and gay rights activists, animated by broader visions of citizenship, began to fight for equal rights, protections, and opportunities. Led by Pauli Murray, Gloria Steinem, Harvey Milk, and Shirley Chisholm, among many others, they achieved lasting successes, including <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, antidiscrimination protections in the workplace, and a more inclusive idea of the American family.</p><p>Yet the establishment of new rights and the visibility of alternative families provoked, beginning in the 1970s, a furious conservative backlash. Politicians and activists on the right, most notably George Wallace, Phyllis Schlafly, Anita Bryant, and Jerry Falwell, built a political movement based on the perceived moral threat to the traditional family. Self writes that "family values" conservatives in fact "paved the way" for fiscal conservatives, who shared a belief in liberalism's invasiveness but lacked a populist message. Reagan's presidency united the two constituencies, which remain, even in these tumultuous times, the base of the Republican Party. <i>All in the Family</i>, an erudite, passionate, and persuasive explanation of our current political situation and how we arrived in it, will allow us to think anew about the last fifty years of American politics.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert O.

Brother-in-law to the slain John F. Kennedy and former director of the Peace Corps, Shriver was confident that the administration&#x2019;s antipoverty initiative reflected sound liberal economic theory and embodied Kennedy&#x2019;s legacy.<br>Others were less convinced. &#x201c;What brought about this limitation to young <i>men</i>?&#x201d; the Oregon congresswoman Edith Green asked Shriver. A longtime advocate for women&#x2019;s rights&#x2014;she had sponsored the 1963 Equal Pay Act&#x2014;Green was the lone woman on the committee considering Shriver&#x2019;s report. &#x201c;Are there not as many young women in this age group?&#x201d;1<br>Shriver&#x2019;s response was telling: &#x201c;The general purpose of these [employment] centers&#x201d; was to help young men who &#x201c;we hope will be heads of families.&#x201d; Naturally, he continued, men were charged with &#x201c;supporting a family.&#x201d; Prepared for such an answer, Green asked if, because the military already absorbed a large number of disadvantaged young men, there was not a &#x201c;greater need&#x201d; to train and employ young women?2<br>The following day, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the clean-cut former president of the Ford Motor Company and emblem of Camelot&#x2019;s masculine resolve, arrived on Capitol Hill to explain another component of the president&#x2019;s War on Poverty, the Pentagon&#x2019;s plan to &#x201c;rehabilitate&#x201d; half a million young men who had failed the Selective Service exam. As she had with Shriver, Green asked McNamara why the administration seemed oblivious of the problems facing women. Plenty of young women, she told the defense secretary, &#x201c;are bogged down because of poverty and are disadvantaged culturally, economically, and educationally.&#x201d; McNamara echoed Shriver by asserting one of the assumptions of the era: &#x201c;Boys are likely to be the heads of families and the primary breadwinners in the family.&#x201d;3<br>Breadwinning was the ideal that had supported both middle-class domesticity and working-class demands for the &#x201c;family wage&#x201d; since the nineteenth century. Breadwinning divided labor by gender: men&#x2019;s work was public, remunerative, family sustaining, while women&#x2019;s work was domestic, caregiving, and, if it was remunerative, supplementary to their husbands&#x2019; wages. He performed market work; she performed family work. The social psychologist Morris Zelditch summed up the era&#x2019;s conventional wisdom in 1955, writing that &#x201c;the American male, by definition, must &#x2018;provide&#x2019; for his family&nbsp;... his primary function in the family is to supply &#x2018;income,&#x2019; to be the &#x2018;breadwinner.&#x2019;&#x201d; Male breadwinning was so taken for granted that it was not even acknowledged as an ideology, as a choice. It functioned as an organizing mythology of social life and was believed to be the bedrock of a sound family and by extension a sound society. Its pervasive influence explains a great deal about how Americans struggled to shape the social order in these decades.4<br>This male head of household contracting his labor in the marketplace was more than social science and cultural touchstone, however. He drove public policy. In the 1930s he was enshrined in the New Deal welfare state, which sought to assist the breadwinner&#x2019;s efforts in the market. Inasmuch as the nation had developed a national employment policy&#x2014;through legislation such as the 1935 Social Security and Wagner acts, the 1937 Fair Labor Standards Act, and the 1946 Employment Act&#x2014;it was based on male-breadwinner ideology. The New Deal&#x2019;s &#x201c;citizen worker&#x201d; and the nuclear family he headed remained a mainstay of conventional liberal thinking and a cornerstone of the Keynesian consensus that guided 1960s economic policy, which together can be called breadwinner liberalism.5<br>For the greater part of the sixties, Green and women like her had little success in challenging breadwinner liberalism. During the heady days of Kennedy&#x2019;s New Frontier and Johnson&#x2019;s Great Society, men, and their status as citizen workers, monopolized the attention of big-picture policy thinkers. The nation&#x2019;s liberal establishment knew that women engaged in market work. After all, federal and state governments offered vocational programs that trained women and provided the poorest among them with needed services. But postwar liberals nonetheless consistently underestimated the growing importance of women&#x2019;s market labor to the fate of families and the nation. They remained well behind a curve that was to define the last third of the twentieth century: the shifting of greater and greater economic responsibilities within the American household, and in the country at large, onto the backs of women.6<br>Yet before Great Society liberalism ran headlong into the women&#x2019;s movement in the late sixties, the black freedom movement had already politicized the nation&#x2019;s breadwinners. Compelled by the surging calls for civil rights and African American equality, liberal officials, from Johnson, Shriver, and McNamara to Robert Weaver and Wilbur Cohen, came to believe that ending racial discrimination and embarking on ambitious antipoverty and affirmative action programs would allow heretofore marginalized black men to become productive workers and heads of families. They sought to expand the reach of breadwinner liberalism to encompass black men. Such efforts collided with a white working-class breadwinner ideology, which championed a presumptively race-neutral ethic of male labor and responsibility. In a paradox that would produce decades of conflict, breadwinner ideology thus became the basis for both a liberal project of racial recompense and equal opportunity and the conservative resistance provoked by that project.<br>Because so few Americans questioned the naturalness of the nuclear family, what most divided Great Society liberals from their opponents was the nature and extent of government assistance. Liberals&#x2019; focus in the sixties on the deficiencies of male breadwinners, especially nonwhite ones, opened a political flank exploited by the opponents of civil rights and the welfare state, critics such as George Wallace or the conservative columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. If men failed to become breadwinners and support families, these opponents argued, it was a personal failure, not a social one. Breadwinners <i>earned</i> their places at the heads of families; their jobs and income were products of individual effort. Government, these critics conceded, should certainly endorse market freedom for potential breadwinners, a classic &#x201c;negative&#x201d; right. But to take further, positive steps to ensure equality was to overextend government&#x2019;s mandate. The allegedly race-blind meritocratic individualism that supplanted forthright segregationism during and especially after the 1960s was a version of breadwinning that could be bent toward a distinctly conservative view of social policy. Arguments against civil rights, affirmative action, and other state interventions on behalf of people of color and poor people increasingly bore the stamp of this individualist, bootstrap version of male-breadwinner ideology. Manhood signaled many things, dependency on government not among them.7<br>As Green&#x2019;s dispute with Shriver and McNamara demonstrated, conservative opposition was hardly breadwinner liberalism&#x2019;s only obstacle. It suffered its own blinders. Breadwinner liberalism failed to come to terms with women&#x2019;s rapidly evolving relationship to work. It posited marriage, not the marketplace, as the vehicle for women&#x2019;s economic security and public standing. The nation&#x2019;s marketplace, the remunerative economic sphere, remained the public world of men. Financially taken care of by her husband, a woman could preoccupy herself with domestic goals, avoiding the rough-and-tumble workplace and the vagaries of the market. Such a model of the sexes, derived largely from nineteenth-century white middle-class notions of public and private spheres, never described a majority of Americans in any decade, but it grew woefully outdated as the long postwar economic boom began to fizzle in the late 1960s.8<br>Breadwinner liberalism represented the dominant liberal thinking in the early sixties. Its advocates believed it to be the best, most politically defensible alternative to socialism on the left and free-market libertarianism on the right. Yet it was far narrower than its architects imagined and therefore vulnerable to social movements that would point out its exclusions. In particular, the rising political fortunes of African Americans and women threw inherited notions of breadwinning, and therefore breadwinner liberalism, into turmoil. The centrality of the male breadwinner was such that the disputes that erupted over him, the critiques leveled at him, and the defenses marshaled on his behalf set in motion a decades-long political and cultural transformation.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Two distinct ways of thinking about work and family clashed in the first half of the 1960s. One focused on women. Its advocates&#x2014;namely, a small but growing coterie of female trade unionists, academics, and politicians (such as Edith Green)&#x2014;argued that with women constituting more than one-third of the paid workforce, the male-breadwinner ideal was becoming a historical relic. In 1962 blue- and pink-collar and professional women together contributed between one-quarter and one-third of family income in the United States, and one in ten households was headed solely by a woman (one in four among African American women). The obstacles these women faced were abundant: low wages, job and educational discrimination, s...</p><h2>Paddling Washington: 100 Flatwater and Whitewater Routes in Washington State and the Inland Northwest</h2><p><br><br>* 112 routes in rivers, streams, lakes, and bays in the Northwest<br><br>* For paddlers of all skill levels<br><br>* Maps, safety tips, equipment requirements, and a route comparison chart<br>This uniquely comprehensive Washington paddling guidebook combines the best of three previous books--<i>Paddle Routes of the Inland Northwest, Paddle Routes of Western Washington</i>, and <i>Washington Whitewater</i>--into one volume.

She is also the author of more than eighty books for young readers.Gr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;Children's literature powerhouses Napoli and Wiesner have teamed up to create a striking graphic novel. On the boardwalk, visitors flock to Ocean Wonders, a tank filled with a shark, fish, an octopus, and a turtle&#x2014;and the star attraction, the elusive Fish Girl. Though kids stare into the water, they catch only a glimpse of the mermaid's fin or arm. Fish Girl's owner and protector, who calls himself Neptune, exerts a Svengali-like control over his mute ward, claiming that he once ruled the ocean and forbidding her from fully revealing herself. But when the young mermaid befriends a girl who visits the tank, she begins to question Neptune's stories about her past and to dream about escaping. Employing inspired composition, a masterly sense of perspective and angles, and a palette dominated by vivid blues and greens, Wiesner submerges readers in Fish Girl's world, conveying both her affection for her home and her companion Octopus and her desire to know life outside her constricting tank. The realistic images and controlled linework hint at a sense of magic below the surface. However, the narrative may stymie readers. Many questions go unanswered (for instance, how does Fish Girl trade her scales and fins for legs when she leaves the water?), and the book ends on a somewhat ambiguous note.

Close to twenty years later, award-winning cartoonist Guy Delisle (<i>Pyongyang</i>, <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Shenzhen</i>, <i>Burma Chronicles</i>) recounts Andr�&#x2019;s harrowing experience in <i>Hostage</i>, a book that attests to the power of one man&#x2019;s determination in the face of a hopeless situation.</p><p>Marking a departure from the author&#x2019;s celebrated first-person travelogues, Delisle tells the story through the perspective of the titular captive, who strives to keep his mind alert as desperation starts to set in. Working in a pared down style with muted color washes, Delisle conveys the psychological effects of solitary confinement, compelling us to ask ourselves some difficult questions regarding the repercussions of negotiating with kidnappers and what it really means to be free. Thoughtful, intense, and moving, <i>Hostage</i> takes a profound look at what drives our will to survive in the darkest of moments.</p></p><p><b>Guy Delisle </b>was born in Quebec City, Canada. His bestselling and acclaimed travelogues (<i>Pyongyang</i>, <i>Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City</i>, <i>Burma Chronicles</i>, and <i>Shenzhen</i>) are defining works of graphic nonfiction, and in 2012, Delisle was awarded the top prize in European cartooning when the French edition of<i> Jerusalem</i> was named Best Album at the Angoul�me International Comics Festival. He lives in France with his wife and children.<p>"<i>Hostage</i> shows what it's like to be held captive ... Delisle brings readers into the room with the hostage and, more importantly, into his state of mind."&#x2015;<i>The Atlantic</i></p><p>"[<i>Hostage</i> is] an indelible portrait of an ordinary person facing a frightening ordeal."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</i></p><p>"The location captured [in <i>Hostage</i>] is less Andre's grim little room than his mind... Delisle transmute[s] tedium into compelling suspense."&#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>"The account of Andr�'s experience... would be powerful enough, if depicted in prose alone. But <i>Hostage</i> is a comic, and it's Delisle's art &#x2015; his character design, his use of page and panel layout to underscore the mind-numbing sameness of solitary confinement while controlling the story's mood and pacing &#x2015; that makes us <i>feel</i> Andr�'s plight so deeply."&#x2015;Glen Weldon, <i>NPR</i></p><p>"This true story of a man&#x2019;s kidnapping in Chechnya confirms Guy Delisle&#x2019;s position as one of the greatest modern cartoonists."&#x2015;Rachel Cooke, <i>The Guardian</i></p><p>"Harrowing and beautiful... I've felt haunted by the book since I finished it."&#x2015;John Warner, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"Delisle&#x2019;s new book, <i>Hostage</i>, is his best since <i>Pyongyang</i>... In its beat-by-beat, day-by-day scope, is ultimately a travelogue about the power of imagination."&#x2015;Hillary Chute, <i>New York Review of Books</i></p><p>"In muted grays, Andr�&#x2019;s capture is depicted as both terrifying and monotonous at once. The terror of loneliness is present in every frame&#x2015;the cells, tightly centered on Andr�, claustrophobia-inducing in their own right."&#x2015;Kevin Nguyen, <i>GQ</i></p><p>"The gutters of a comic have never felt more like those prison bars than they do in <i>Hostage.</i> Still, Delisle&#x2019;s humane approach keeps this from become a trip to the zoo; he makes you not just see, but feel Andr�&#x2019;s anguish."&#x2015;Mark Peters, <i>Salon</i></p><p>"A modern master of the travelogue... [returns] with a surge of blood-pumping adrenaline."&#x2015;Amos Barshad, <i>The Fader</i> </p><p>&#x201c;Guy Delisle conveys great, slow-burning tension in this sublime account of what Christophe Andre endured as a hostage in Chechnya. Delisle&#x2019;s controlled handling of claustrophobic physical and mental spaces &#x2013; and the rhythm he generates &#x2013; is the work of a patient master.&#x201d;&#x2015;Joe Sacco, author of <i>Palestine</i></p><p>&#x201c;A book about a man trapped in the corner of a room should not be exhilarating, but somehow Delisle has managed to create just that. He takes us through Christophe Andr�&#x2019;s narrative of his time spent as a prisoner with an attention to detail that makes you feel like you&#x2019;re right there with him, chained to a radiator, counting the days to keep yourself from losing your mind.

All it took to get going was some wadded-up newspaper, a small pyramid of charcoal, and a match. To keep the flame alive, we put our cheeks to the chilly pavement and blew on the bottom layer of coals. Diners leaving the cafe from early dinners glanced at us, chuckled nervously, and hurried along to their cars. When the pile was glowing, we added some split logs and the plume of smoke rising from the pavement became woodsy and fragrant. By the time the sun went down, the flames were hotter and brighter, so we added more oak. Once the fire was roaring, customers in the restaurant became concerned, and the chef, Sarah, in clogs and a kerchief, shuffled out with the buttoned-up manager, Lori, to check on us. <br> <p>Continue Reading "A Night in Louisville"<br> </p><p></p><br> <br> <p><b>Recipe Excerpts from <i>The Lee Bros.

Eisenhower wrote memoranda to himself during World War II as a way to think through complex problems. Martin Luther King found moral courage while sitting alone at his kitchen table one night during the Montgomery bus boycott. Jane Goodall used her intuition in the jungles of Central Africa while learning how to approach chimps. Solitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others. We are losing solitude without even realizing it.</p><p>To find solitude today, a leader must make a conscious effort. This book explains why the effort is worthwhile and how to make it. Through gripping historical accounts and firsthand interviews with a wide range of contemporary leaders, Raymond Kethledge (a federal court of appeals judge) and Michael Erwin (a West Pointer and three-tour combat veteran) show how solitude can enhance clarity, spur creativity, sustain emotional balance, and generate the moral courage necessary to overcome adversity and criticism. Anyone who leads anyone-including oneself-can benefit from solitude. With a foreword by Jim Collins (author of the bestseller <i>Good to Great</i>), <i>Lead Yourself First </i>is a rallying cry to reclaim solitude-and all the benefits, both practical and sublime, that come with it.</p></p><p><p><b>Raymond M. Kethledge </b>is a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and was a candidate for the Supreme Court in 2018. He formerly served as a law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy and founded his own law firm. He lives near Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p><p><b>Michael S. Erwin </b>is a graduate of West Point and served three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. He is now the CEO of the Character &amp; Leadership Center, the president of the Positivity Project, and the founder and chairman of Team Red, White &amp; Blue. He lives in North Carolina.</p><p>"<i>Lead Yourself First </i>makes a compelling argument for the integral relationship between solitude and leadership." - Andrew Stark, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"A thoughtful new book <i>Lead Yourself First </i>. . . tells the stories of many inspiring leaders throughout history who relied on solitude at crucial moments in their lives, from Winston Churchill and Pope John Paul II to Martin Luther King Jr. and Aung San Suu Kyi . . . But as the authors point out, you don't have to lead armies, corporations, or artistic movements to benefit from solitude."<i> - The Washington Post</i></p><p>"This thoughtful self-improvement guide from Kethledge, a Sixth Circuit judge, and Erwin, founder of the nonprofit Positivity Project, is a must-read for leaders who take their leadership roles seriously. It is a book to digest slowly, a powerful narrative . . . . This book is a rare gem, offering an optimistic message that there remain powerful leaders intent on being courageous and moral, and on finding 'transcendent meaning' in their vocation." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Solitude is the birthplace of clarity and perspective. As a leader, I&#x2019;ve experienced this truth and as a researcher I&#x2019;ve seen the power that solitude brings to leaders. The tough part is that it takes real courage and discipline to make solitude a practice. In this important book, Ray Kethledge and Mike Erwin show us how it&#x2019;s done and the profound difference it can make in our organizations." - Bren� Brown, Ph.D. Author of DARING GREATLY and RISING STRONG</p><p>"I&#x2019;ve never met an effective leader--in any field or in private life--who doesn&#x2019;t see solitude as crucial to their work in the world. Yet too many people believe that solitary time is wasted time, self-indulgent time. Through a series of fascinating case studies, Ray Kethledge and Mike Erwin make a powerful case--and an urgent plea--for placing quiet time at the beating heart of every leader&#x2019;s daily schedule." - Susan Cain, author of QUIET</p><p>"In<i> Lead Yourself First</i>, Ray Kethledge and Mike Erwin explain why it is so important for leaders to get away from the technology and to reassess and reorganize their own thoughts, in order to make the right decisions. This book offers great insights and comes at a critical time for business leaders. Certainly a must-read for any leader who feels the crush of information overload." - General Stanley McChrystal (retired), former Commander of Joint Special Operations Command</p><p>"<i>Lead Yourself First</i> is a beautiful, empowering, and engaging book. In my heart, I've always known the importance of solitude. Amid the world's constant noise, I've trained myself to look in the mirror and create silence and space when things are at their brink. This inspiring book reminds us that everything we need is already inside of us." - Kerri Walsh Jennings 4-time Olympic medalist in Beach Volleyball</p></p><h2>The Golden Oldies Guesthouse: The perfect feel good novel about second chances!</h2><p><b>&#x2018;Dee MacDonald&#x2019;s books are so heart-warming.

He lives in Baltimore.<b>1</b><br><br><b>Berlin, 1979</b><br>The older man sat down at the kitchen table in the back of the safe house and recited the words for a second time. His monotone made it sound like a lesson, or maybe an incantation&#x2014;some spell he was trying to cast over his listener:<br><br>&#x201c;To swim the pond you must forsake the bay. You may touch the lake, but you must never submerge, and you must always return to the pond.&#x201d;<br><br>The younger man, with his arms crossed, nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;And the zoo?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dry. To all of us, anyway. The pond is also dry, to the zookeeper.&#x201d; A pause, a wheezing intake of breath. &#x201c;All of their people believe it to be long since drained, and its waters shall forever be invisible. Except of course to those of us with special eyewear. And that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re offering, if you&#x2019;re interested.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eyewear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So to speak. A new way of seeing. And access, opportunity. More than you&#x2019;ve ever dreamed of.&#x201d;<br><br>The older man poured some whiskey. He swallowed and set down the glass sharply, like he was knocking for entry.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand a word of it, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some of it. Not all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re inviting you in. But before that can happen we have to dry you off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From my swim in the bay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>The younger man frowned and shuffled his feet. But the tilt of his head, the narrowing of his eyes, betrayed heightened interest. He uncrossed his arms and spoke again.<br><br>&#x201c;First you have to tell me more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. First you have to tell me the route you took to get here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just like you said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were alone? No shadows, start to finish?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You saw the finish. There was no one at the start, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Positive? Even on the S-Bahn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I took every precaution. The route was clean. I have done this before, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>A long pause, followed by another gurgle of whiskey, a second knock of the glass.<br><br>&#x201c;Come here, then.&#x201d; The wheeze, yet again. &#x201c;Sit down.&#x201d;<br><br>The younger man took a step forward and then stopped, as if something else had just occurred to him.<br><br>&#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s no sale? This isn&#x2019;t one of those things where if you tell me then you have to kill me, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>The older man laughed, choppy notes from an old accordion.<br><br>&#x201c;Come. Have a drink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was that a yes or no?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a yes-no question. Sit down and I&#x2019;ll explain. People are dying out there, Lewis. They&#x2019;re drowning with no one in the whole damn bay to save them, and you can change that overnight. As that Polish girl of yours likes to say, time&#x2019;s a-wasting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know about her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rule one, Lewis. Always assume we know more than you think.&#x201d;<br><br>Upstairs, in the room with the equipment, Helen Abell took note of the name &#x201c;Lewis&#x201d; as she leaned forward on stocking feet, straining to listen through the headset. A cryptonym, no doubt, but something about it was familiar. He wasn&#x2019;t part of Berlin station&#x2014;or, as the old-timers still called it, the Berlin Operations Base, or BOB&#x2014;but maybe she had come across his name in a memo, or the cable traffic.<br><br>For the next few seconds all she heard was the sound of the younger man&#x2019;s footsteps crossing the kitchen floor&#x2014;<i>clop, clop, clop</i>, as loud as a Clydesdale&#x2014;and the scrape of a chair as he sat at the table. It made her recall his polished black shoes, clunky, like the ones the East Germans wore.<br><br>The men had arrived a few minutes earlier. Helen had peeked out the window the moment she heard the rattle of a key in the lock, and she&#x2019;d spotted them on the doorstep out front. Unexpected visitors, and neither looked familiar. But the mention of &#x201c;Lewis&#x201d; was a thread she could work with.<br><br>The wheels of the tape recorder kept turning, twin planets in rotation, absorbing every word. She was afraid to move lest the floor creak, giving her away. Too late to announce her presence. Was she wrong to leave the recorder on? To be listening at all? Probably. <i>Undoubtedly</i>. The whole thing was almost certainly way above her clearance. But she&#x2019;d never heard any conversation like it.<br><br>From her brief observation she&#x2019;d discerned that both men carried themselves with an air of competence and seniority&#x2014;experienced hands in a special order, one which she aspired to join. It was like eavesdropping on a conversation of the gods. Nonetheless, she was off-limits and it was time to bow out. She should switch off the recorder, remove the headphones, and quietly wait for them to leave. With a sigh, she reached for the off switch.<br><br>Then the needles flicked on the dials as the younger man spoke, and her hand stopped in midair. He&#x2019;d lowered his voice, and Helen, unable to help herself, squinted in concentration to make out the words.<br><br>&#x201c;Do the effies know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a thing, or not since Jack kicked the bucket in &#x2019;72.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jack? You mean . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was a friend?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of a sort. The enemy of my enemy, that whole business. Last of his kind. Here, drink up.&#x201d;<br><br>A splash of whiskey, then silence.<br><br>Helen was transfixed. <i>What in the hell were they talking about? </i>The effies. The zoo. The pond, the bay, and the lake. And now a reference to a former power figure named Jack&#x2014;probably another cryptonym. Everything about the conversation was baffling, and not just because she didn&#x2019;t know the lingo.<br><br>For starters, why speak in code? The whole point of a safe house was to make you feel secure enough to dispense with the mumbo jumbo. You kicked back, put your feet up, traded all the secrets you wanted in the plainest possible language. Safely, and with absolute confidence. That&#x2019;s how she&#x2019;d rigged these houses, four of them in all across the zones and neighborhoods of West Berlin, available at any given moment for privileged access and secret consultation. Each house was clean, unobtrusive, and practically soundproofed against the curiosity of neighbors, due mostly to her own efforts during the past year.<br><br>She was particularly proud of the job she&#x2019;d done at this location, a crumbling brick townhouse a block south of Alt-Moabit. She had labored zealously to craft the most secure possible environment for the Company&#x2019;s case officers and their agents, or for whoever else among their friends might temporarily need shelter from the cold and lonely hazards of their profession.<br><br>Why, then, this strange collection of buzzwords? Unless it wasn&#x2019;t so much a code as a special language&#x2014;and, yes, there was a difference&#x2014;an exclusive lexicon for some obscure fraternity of operatives. Perhaps for someone with a higher security clearance this would be no mystery at all.<br><br>She also wondered how the men had gotten a key. Helen knew the identities of all six key holders for this house. Someone had given them a key without telling her. That in itself was a serious breach of security.<br><br>In addition, the meeting was unscheduled. When people wanted to use one of her facilities&#x2014;okay, one of the <i>Agency</i>&#x2019;s facilities&#x2014;the rules said they were supposed to provide at least six hours&#x2019; notice, so she could ensure that no one else would barge in on them, and that conditions would be welcoming and ready. Before she took over, embarrassing run-ins and overlaps had been infrequent but not at all unheard of, a state of affairs that the chief of station had seemed to accept as an occupational hazard. Helen had taken pains to eliminate such snafus. It was all in the details&#x2014;controllingthe leaseholders, managing traffic, making the places easy to use, clean, and functional. She had carefully vetted the current cover tenant for this house, a Pan Am stewardess with Agency connections whose work schedule meant she was home only on Wednesdays and Sundays, and even on those days could clear the premises at a moment&#x2019;s notice.<br><br>There were contingencies for unannounced meetings, of course, and also for use by operatives and agents who weren&#x2019;t regular customers. Espionage emergencies were hardly uncommon in Berlin. But the meeting Helen was hearing downstairs had none of the snap or crackle of an urgent rendezvous.<br><br>This chat was unrushed, collegial, and despite the age difference she suspected that these men were on roughly equal footing, meaning it probably wasn&#x2019;t a meeting between a case officer and his local agent. Their English was flawless, no trace of a foreign accent. They were either American or very practiced at pretending to be American.<br><br>Of course, technically speaking, Helen wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be there, either. That was the rub, and the reason for her deathly silence. Unbeknownst to the Agency, she had begun making surprise weekly inspections of her four properties. It was the most efficient way to uncover shabby upkeep and lax practices. She kept the visits off the books or they wouldn&#x2019;t have worked. Yet another way in which she went the extra mile, a trait she&#x2019;d become known for since her arrival in Berlin fourteen months earlier.<br><br>The job certainly hadn&#x2019;t been her top choice. Not even close. She&#x2019;d always suspected that the chief of station, a randy old mossback named Ladd Herrington, made the assignment to demean her, to put her in her place.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re only twenty-three?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said on that first day, peeping above the frames of reading glasses as he pawed through her file. His eyes wandered quickly from her face to her breasts, where he let them rest long enough to make her uncomfortable.<br><br>&#x201c;You do know you&#x2019;d be happier as an analyst, don&#x2019;t you? In the long term, anyway. Much better prospects for advancement. For marriage, too, although perhaps that doesn&#x2019;t interest you. Here, on the other hand . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He flapped a hand dismissively, as if they were assessing her chances of discovering a new comet, or of recruiting Leonid Brezhnev as a double agent. Analyst. The default assignment for any Agency female, except the ones exiled to records, or to some other &#x201c;special branch&#x201d; of this or that department as long as it was well behind the scenes. Hardly any made it into the field.<br><br>Nonetheless, there she&#x2019;d been, arriving on Herrington&#x2019;s doorstep with only two years of experience for a posting to the city that had defined the Cold War, and he&#x2019;d responded by slotting her in a position that until then had been largely clerical, staffed by someone two steps below her pay grade. To make it sound less offensive, or perhaps to heighten the joke, he&#x2019;d come up with a new title: Chief of Administration for Logistics, Property and Personnel Branch, Berlin Station.<br><br>Helen had sulked for a week before deciding to make the most of it. She explored and then exploited the job&#x2019;s opportunities, which turned out to be more expansive than anyone had realized. She revetted the tenants, rescouted the locations. Finding all of them lacking, she replaced them several months ahead of the usual rotation. She tightened hiring practices for support staff, upgraded the facilities at minimal cost, and instituted greater accountability among users. Overlaps and screwups disappeared, as did the mice and bedbugs. Complaints from field men dwindled. She made connections, widened her niche, found a lover, and settled in to Berlin&#x2019;s cold, grim majesty with a sardonic viewpoint worthy of a lifer.<br><br>And now, here she was, caught in the middle of one of her surprise inspections, silent and still and, for the moment, trapped upstairs on a gray October Monday at mid-afternoon as she wondered what the hell she&#x2019;d stumbled onto.<br><br>She had arrived at the house shortly after 2 p.m., dressed in maid&#x2019;s clothing and carrying a mop and bucket to minimize curiosity from the neighbors, although she already knew enough about their work schedules to be confident that the block would be empty, apart from the usual scattering of <b><i>Kinder und Hausfrauen</i></b>.<br><br>After entering, she proceeded by her customary routine. Locks and latches? Check. General cleanliness? Better than last time, at least. No more mouse droppings beneath the sink, which in this neighborhood was all you could hope for. Refrigerator? Well stocked, nothing gone sour or moldy. Liquor supply? Ample and safe in its usual hideaway, off-limitsto the cover tenant.<br><br>Last on her checklist was the taping system. She always tested it by walking from front to back downstairs while reciting a favorite poem from Rilke. Sometimes she declaimed in German. Today, in English. She spoke the opening lines while standing in the parlor near the front door.<br><br><i>How can I keep my soul in me, so that</i><br><i>it doesn&#x2019;t touch your soul? How can I raise</i><br><i>it high enough, past you, to other things?</i><br><br>Noting the cleanliness of the carpet and the furniture, she began stepping slowly toward the back of the house. Passing the stairwell into the dining room, she spotted a smudge on the wall to her left; above, a crack in the celling. But she never stopped speaking:<br><br><i>I would like to shelter it, among remote</i><br><i>lost objects, in some dark and silent place</i><br><i>that doesn&#x2019;t resonate when your depths resound.</i><br><br>She entered the kitchen. Rilke had named the poem &#x201c;Love Song,&#x201d; but for Helen the words never brought to mind any man, past or present. It instead made her reflect on this strange profession of hers, this realm where it was risky indeed to touch the souls of others or, sometimes, even to try and shelter them in some dark and silent place&#x2014;like this house.<br><br>Helen uttered the final lines while peering out the back window into the small garden with its bare plum tree.<br><br><i>Yet everything that touches us, me and you,</i><br><i>takes us together like a violin&#x2019;s bow,</i><br><i>which draws one voice out of two separate strings.</i><br><i>Upon what instrument are we two spanned?</i><br><i>And what musician holds us in his hand?</i><br><i>Oh sweetest song.<br><br></i>With the words still resonating in her head, she climbed the stairs. Her routine was to rewind the tape and play it back, listening carefully to make sure the microphones had picked up every syllable. If no tweaks or repairs were needed, she erased it and was on her way.<br><br>Today she&#x2019;d heard the key in the front door just as she was reaching for the stop button. Heart beating fast, she&#x2019;d moved to the window. That&#x2019;s when she saw the older man, the key holder.</p><h2>The Ultimate Chess Puzzle Book</h2><p>It is generally agreed that one of the best ways for a chess-player to improve is by studying tactics &#x2013; and the best way to do that is by practising.

Don't miss her new novel, <i>Do Not Become Alarmed</i>.&nbsp;<br></b><br> Meloy's first return to short stories since her critically acclaimed debut,&nbsp;<i>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</i>&nbsp;is an extraordinary new work from one of the most promising writers of the last decade.<br><br> Eleven unforgettable new stories demonstrate the emotional power and the clean, assured style that have earned Meloy praise from critics and devotion from readers. Propelled by a terrific instinct for storytelling, and concerned with the convolutions of modern love and the importance of place, this collection is about the battlefields-and fields of victory-that exist in seemingly harmless spaces, in kitchens and living rooms and cars. Set mostly in the American West, the stories feature small-town lawyers, ranchers, doctors, parents, and children, and explore the moral quandaries of love, family, and friendship. A ranch hand falls for a recent law school graduate who appears unexpectedly- and reluctantly-in his remote Montana town. A young father opens his door to find his dead grandmother standing on the front step. Two women weigh love and betrayal during an early snow. Throughout the book, Meloy examines the tensions between having and wanting, as her characters try to keep hold of opposing forces in their lives: innocence and experience, risk and stability, fidelity and desire.<br><br> Knowing, sly, and bittersweet,&nbsp;<i>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</i>&nbsp;confirms Maile Meloy's singular literary talent. Her lean, controlled prose, full of insight and unexpected poignancy, is the perfect complement to her powerfully moving storytelling.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, July 2009:</strong> There is one line in Maile Meloy's newest story collection that completely slayed me. (It's on page 97.) And in fact, there are many moments before and after that line that left me awestruck as I wondered how she was able to capture a feeling--typically one that's very familiar, like the flushing embarrassment of an unexpected advance, or the sudden fury found in a bout of sibling rivalry--and create it anew. The effect is both masterful and ephemeral: all of a sudden, it's as if your own life is reflected back to you. This is what great story writers do, and in the stories that follow--whose characters revel or unravel in their relationships to love and family--Maile Meloy pinpoints the ambivalence running through our most powerful emotions, be it love, jealousy, grief, or loneliness. That she writes with so much truth and wisdom and restraint makes <em>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</em> an unexpected pleasure and a worthy outside-the-box pick for your summer reading. <em>--Anne Bartholomew</em><br> <br> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Maile Meloy on Arranging Stories</strong><br><br> My most recent book, <em>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</em>, is a story collection, as was my first. Lately people have been asking me about how you decide which stories to include in a collection, and what order they go in, which was (and still is) a big question of mine. <br><br>When I was writing the stories that became my first book, <em>Half in Love</em>, I read great collections to see how it was done: Philip Roth&#x2019;s <em>Goodbye, Columbus</em>; J.D. Salinger&#x2019;s <em>Nine Stories</em>; Merce Rodereda's <em>My Christina</em>; D.H. Lawrence's <em>England, My England</em>; Hemingway's <em>In Our Time</em>. I wanted to know how the arrangement of eight or ten or twelve stories could create a complete experience that the reader could move through, when the stories weren't linked in any way except for the fact that one writer wrote them, but it was hard to see how I could transfer that information to my own book. <br><br>I was taking a class from Ann Patchett then, and she said, about the number of stories in a collection, that Salinger's <em>Nine </em>was like eight hours sleep&#x2014;a little more was okay, a little less was fine, but it was a good general guideline. About variety, she said that a collection was like a mall: it needed a few big stories with broad horizons, like the big anchor stores, to make a space in which the smaller, quirkier stories could survive. <br><br>That made sense, so in putting <em>Half in Love</em> together I took some stories out, and left others in, and set aside two linked ones to start a novel with. I made lists of the titles, and annotated them with codes about what was in each story, some of which were so obscure I can't decipher them now. (One was "adbhj." I have no idea what that means.) The easily breakable codes indicated that the story was in 1st person, or 3rd, or 2nd, and whether the protagonist was male or female, and where the story was set. Then I cut the lists apart and moved the titles around on the kitchen table. I spent a long time trying to keep the first-person stories away from each other, before realizing that I didn't need to, that it wasn't difficult to move from one first-person narrator to another. We're used to hearing different voices telling us things about their lives, and I ended up having four in a row. <br><br>I did the same thing for <em>Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</em>, with the annotated titles on cut-up pieces of sticky notes, so they would stay in place&#x2014;an improvement on the method. Otherwise, the arranging hadn't gotten any easier. I knew which title went first, and had a sense about which one might go last, but I moved the middle around for days, trying different sequences. <br><br>I got out Salinger's <em>Nine </em>again, because it struck me as the Platonic ideal of a story collection, and I thought about it as a template, wondering which story was my "DeDaumier Smith's Blue Period," and which was my "Teddy." But that came to seem futile and silly, and I went back to thinking about my own stories. <br><br>I put a story set in Connecticut third, after two Montana stories, so it was clear that the collection was going to go to other places. And there were two stories that made sense near each other, but needed to be separated, like quarreling siblings. The story about a man whose daughter has been murdered couldn't go early. It had to go somewhere in the middle, at a point when the reader was already in the book. And it seemed good to have a lighter story after it, about a grandmother who comes back from the dead. <br><br>Sometimes the arranging felt like lining up the batting order for a baseball game: which story leads off? And sometimes it felt like seating people at a dinner party: boy-girl-boy-girl if possible, and certain stories shouldn't go next to each other, and try to encourage interesting conversation. And sometimes it felt like making a mix tape for someone you love. But mostly it felt like a puzzle with a discoverable solution, and moving the pieces around was part of the pleasure. <br> <br>Maile Meloy is the author of the story collection <i>Half in Love</i>, and the novels <i>Liars and Saints</i>, shortlisted for the 2005 Orange Prize, and <i>A Family Daughter</i>.

Fu talismans are ideograms and writings typically rendered on paper and empowered by means of invocations, ritual, and transferences of energy, or Qi. Talismans can be used for many purposes, such as strengthening or weakening personality characteristics, finding love, earning more money, or easing emotional tensions in the home. <i>The Tao of Craft </i>shows how metaphysical energy can be harnessed to amplify, strengthen, weaken, dispel, or block other metaphysical energy and to rectify perceived imbalances in the material plane. Supported by an abundance of detailed charts and images, this book serves as a step-by-step handbook that gives readers the knowledge and confidence to craft their own Fu talismans for personal empowerment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wen, author of <i>Holistic Tarot,</i> delves into historic and cultural contexts of the Fu, from the neolithic period of Chinese history to contemporary practices of esoteric Taoism. Providing a solid foundation in the principles of Eastern spellcrafting, she highlights the blending of Taoist metaphysical practices with Western approaches to magic by pointing out eclectic, integrating, and harmonizing facets from other cultures and religions. <br>&nbsp;<br>Historically, Fu talismans were used by medieval Chinese for alleviating illness; averting misfortune, magical attacks, and curses; defending against assaults; and avoiding poverty. This book shows Western practitioners that the skill and knowledge to develop an interactive relationship with spirit realms are still available to them today, and serves as a practical handbook for accumulating Qi energy from sources in the environment and channeling it in concentrated form into their own Fu talismans.</p><p>Benebell Wen is a practitioner of various metaphysical arts. She studies tarot, feng shui, the <i>I Ching,</i> numerology, and both Chinese and Hellenisic astrology. Wen is the author of <i>Holistic Tarot: An Integrative Approach to Using Tarot for Personal Growth</i> (North Atlantic Books, 2015). When not lecturing, teaching, or writing on metaphysics, Wen practices law in California and New York. She is of Taiwanese descent and currently lives in Northern California with her husband, James, and their beloved cat.&#x201c;Benebell Wen has gifted us with an amazingly rich resource for a life of magic and fulfillment, revealing the sacred and empowering&nbsp;<i>why</i>&nbsp;behind the ancient Taoist art and practice of talisman crafting.

With wit and candor he demystifies the music that is the birthright of every American and demonstrates how a real understanding of the central idea of jazz&#x2013;the unique balance between self-expression and sacrifice for the common good exemplified on the bandstand&#x2013;can enrich every aspect of our lives, from the bedroom to the boardroom, from the schoolroom to City Hall. Along the way, Marsalis helps us understand the life-changing message of the blues, reveals secrets about playing&#x2013;and listening&#x2013;and passes on wisdom he has gleaned from working with three generations of great musicians. Illuminating and inspiring, Moving to Higher Ground is a master class on jazz and life, conducted by a brilliant American artist.</p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> "In this book I hope to reach a new audience with the positive message of America&#x2019;s greatest music, to show how great musicians demonstrate on the bandstand a mutual respect and trust that can alter your outlook on the world and enrich every aspect of your life&#x2013;from individual creativity and personal relationships to conducting business and understanding what it means to be American in the most modern sense." <br>--Wynton Marsalis <br> <br> In this beautiful book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning musician and composer Wynton Marsalis explores jazz and how an understanding of it can lead to deeper, more original ways of being, living, and relating&#x2013;for individuals, communities, and nations. Marsalis shows us how to listen to jazz, and through stories about his life and the lessons he has learned from other music greats, he reveals how the central ideas in jazz can influence the way people think and even how they behave with others, changing self, family, and community for the better. At the heart of jazz is the expression of personality and individuality, coupled with an ability to listen to and improvise with others. Jazz as an art--and as a way to move people and nations to higher ground--is at the core of this unique, illuminating, and inspiring book, a master class on jazz and life by a brilliant American artist. <br> <br> <strong>An Interview with Wynton Marsalis</strong> <br> <br> <b>Q: You&#x2019;re a musician and composer. Why did you write this book, which is about life and lots of other things besides jazz?</b> <br> A: When I first decided to become a musician, at the age of 12 or 13, I was inspired by my father, and by the New Orleans jazz tradition. I was under the impression that I had only to learn the fundamentals of music--rhythm, melody, harmony, texture--to progress as a musician. What I didn&#x2019;t know then was that over the next three decades, jazz music would teach me many significant things about living. This book grew out of ten years of conversatins with my friend Geoff Ward, and is my attempt to share some of it&#x2014;about how important it is to be yourself in the world, and at the same time create while respecting the creativity of others. <br> <br> <b>Q: What does the title of this book, <i>Moving to Higher Ground</i>, mean to you?</b> <br> A: Too often in life, petty squabbles and small-mindedness keep us from realizing a higher purpose. In jazz, that higher purpose is not theoretical: We want to sound good. And when we do, you can hear what it&#x2019;s like when people are really trying to get along. It&#x2019;s purely human: In Jazz, you can mess up and still come together, still move together to higher ground. The title means ascending through engagement. <br> <br> <b>Q: You suggest that the ideas at the heart of jazz can carry over into everyday life. How so?</b> <br> A: Let&#x2019;s take two ideas in jazz that are most central: swinging and the blues. <br> <br> Swinging is the art of negotiation with someone else, under the pressure of time. It shows you how opposites can come together, without compromising who they are. The one who plays the highest-sounding instrument in the rhythm section--the time-keeping cymbal--has to find a way of working with the one who plays the lowest instrument, the bass. And the bass player, who plays the softest instrument, has to find a way of working with the player of the loudest, the drums. To succeed, everybody has to have a very clear idea of the common goal: What exactly are we here to do? In jazz we know: swing. In life, if everyone involved can agree on a primary objective, a group can accomplish almost anything. <br> <br> The blues is many things--a musical form, a distinctive sound, a universal feeling--but above all, the blues is survival music. It&#x2019;s message is simple: things are never so bad that they can&#x2019;t get any better. It&#x2019;s about crying over something, actually wailing--and it&#x2019;s about coming back. The words may be sad but the dancing shuffle (the definitive rhythm of the blues) is always happy or heading toward happiness. The blues is about what is--and what is has demons and angels sitting at the same table. That&#x2019;s a bitter-sweet and realistic message about life that everybody needs, that everybody can hear and respond to. I&#x2019;ve heard people respond to it, all over the world. <br> <br> <b>Q: How do jazz principles apply to, say, holding a successful meeting?</b> <br> A: If you come to a meeting without an agenda it&#x2019;s probably not going to be a very good meeting. In jazz improvisation, the agenda is the form of the song. But an agenda alone doesn&#x2019;t guarantee success. If everybody feels free to participate, unexpected things are sure to come up and will have to be dealt with intelligently. That&#x2019;s true in jazz improvisation, too. Things are bound to come up. Some need to be discarded right away. Others need to be expounded upon. Anyone in the rhythm section playing along behind the soloist can decide, "Hey, we need to investigate this further." And the soloist can respond, "Yeah, let&#x2019;s go into that." It&#x2019;s a system of checks and balances, but what makes it work is the fact that everybody is listening and responding to what the soloist is saying without ever forgetting the agenda. That&#x2019;s a pretty good model for swinging, and for getting things done. <br> <br> <b>Q: How do jazz principles apply to a family?</b> <br> The central relationship on the bandstand is between the bass and the drums. They&#x2019;re opposites of volume and register. The drums are the loudest and the swung cymbal is the highest-pitched while the bass is the softest and lowest-pitched. In order to swing, the right-hand stroke on the cymbal must find the right-hand pluck of the bass on every beat. While it is impossible to line those beats up with metronomic perfection it is possible to achieve a perfect intent to be together. That&#x2019;s what you would like to see with a mama and a daddy. They represent gender opposites. While they try to come together to solve a problem we can go in the direction of a good time. When they don&#x2019;t--when one is too loud or the other is unyielding--it becomes a matter of endurance, not swinging. <br> <br> <b>Q: What can jazz teach us about our feelings and ourselves as individuals?</b> <br> A: We&#x2019;re all given the gift of creativity. It comes out in all kinds of ways--the way we talk or dress or cook or whistle. I remember when I was a kid my friends and I used to see who could cut grass in the most creative way. But many times young people are put down for having a gift or skill that doesn&#x2019;t fit with somebody else&#x2019;s idea of what he or she should do with their lives. Jazz is the opposite of that. It tells you, "That&#x2019;s you! Take pride in this thing. Express yourself. Your sound is unique. Work on it. Understand it." Often it teaches you to celebrate yourself. <br> <br> When we talk about expressing feelings in jazz, we mean spiritual feelings, empathetic feelings, feelings that are beyond thought. In jazz, musical ideas move too quickly for you to stop and analyze or to formulate a lie. By the time you think about it, that moment of music is long gone. Jazz teaches you to cherish how you feel in the moment. It puts a premium on having faith in the people you&#x2019;re playing with. Because the second you lose that faith and start to question what they&#x2019;re doing, the distraction takes your mind off the music and onto bad decisions that you will surely begin to make. The combination of emotional honesty and mutual trust that jazz demands can help you if applied to almost any field. <br> <br> <b>Q: How can jazz help you understand your own friends and family better?</b> <br> A: At first it may seem like a paradox, but jazz helps you understand other people by teaching you that you never really know anybody. When you play music with someone--even someone you think you know really well--they&#x2019;ll play things you don&#x2019;t expect and can&#x2019;t anticipate. You&#x2019;ll go in one direction, based on what you think is going to happen and they&#x2019;ll take a completely different path. Jazz lets people be free, and to surprise you--and them. It doesn&#x2019;t let you mail in your response or let you lump people into categories that turn out to be meaningless. <br> <br> It also shows you that people, even geniuses, evolve over time. The Duke Ellington who played in 1931 was very different from the Duke of 1961. So you learn to be patient with other people and respect the progress they&#x2019;ve made and are still capable of making. One of the biggest challenges in dealing with friends and family is communication and more communication. Jazz forces us to communicate with people while recognizing their objectives, and over objectives, and where we can come together. <br> <br> <b>Q: How is jazz related to America, the country that created it?</b> <br> A: This art form was created to explain who we are. We have rights and responsibilities in the music just as we do as citizens. The Constitution can be amended and songs can always be added to or changes. In jazz we place a premium on the individual&#x2019;s right to self-expression but we also insist on checks and balances between one person&#x2019;s rights infringing on another--the soloists and the rhythm section have to work things out together. Otherwise the piece is a mess. <br> <br> Jazz allows us to improvise, to negotiate with one another. It&#x2019;s the sound of many people coming together in one thing. You might be from Chicago and be Jewish but you can stand on this bandstand with a Creole from New Orleans and when both of y&#x2019;all play, you&#x2019;ll agree on what sounds good, and you&#x2019;ll agree on it because you both can hear it. It&#x2019;s democracy in action and it allows us, for all our faults, to see the success of our history. It tells us who we have been, who we are now, and who we can be in the future. <br> <br> <b>Q: Why is jazz especially relevant today?</b> <br> A: This country is looking for change. Just look at what&#x2019;s going on: An African American and a woman were leading contenders for the presidency; Big questions of race and identity; millions of brand-new voters turning out. Barack Obama carrying southern states in the primaries with a charismatic message of coming together. It&#x2019;s a different time in our country and I think it&#x2019;s the perfect time for this music. <br> <br> Now, jazz has always been timely because it deals with the timeless issues of people, and of our democracy. Louis Armstrong dealt with them. So did Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. But if you listen to political candidates today, they almost never talk about culture. It&#x2019;s never really been part of our national dialogue and it should be, because it&#x2019;s the best was for us actually to come together. We talk a lot about having national conversations and we&#x2019;ve tried legislating unity. But we need to understand that art can bring people who are different together. Jazz provides a context for all the experiences we as human beings share. <br> <br> The direction of our culture is ascendant. Jazz is a perfect embodiment of that. Jazz is ascendant. If we take a long view of the past 150 years, we won&#x2019;t come to the conclusion that things are getting worse. We still have problems of corruption and greed. Jazz can provide a good antidote for them, too. To maintain their integrity, musicians have had to make many decisions that placed substance over commercial success. Jazz musicians have always aspired to an almost Utopian vision of a country in which everybody would come together and swing. <br> <br> The contemporary excitement around empowering people is not new to jazz. Jazz is empowerment. Its first great achievement was to empower individual musicians to take part in the creative process through improvisation. Participation is essential to a healthy American democracy, and it&#x2019;s essential to America&#x2019;s greatest music, too. Everybody has to participate to make it sound good. Whether you&#x2019;re playing or listening, you have to be active. If you&#x2019;re just sitting there and waiting for something to happen, nothing will. I hope this book will empower as many people as possible to take part by showing how an understanding of jazz and its principles can change your life, and our lives together. <br> <br>Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, musician, educator, and composer, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and received his first trumpet from renowned musician Al Hirt at the age of six.

But de la Vald�ne is also a naturalist at heart, and as he planted trees and divided fields, he found that running the farm compelled him to operate as both hunter and preservationist, predator and protector. De la Vald�ne structures his reflections around a year in the life cycle of the bobwhite quail, from one generation&#39;s birth through mating and the raising of their young. Along the way, he gets pulled along on some side trips: to a masterpiece of controlled burning performed by a Vietnam veteran in a helicopter with 300 gallons of napalm, and to his own adventures when he improvises some dam-raising to fill his pond. For a Handful of Feathers reconciles a passion for hunting with a deep sentiment for the wild. Learning early on that while his work on the farm may awe his friends, he can never impress nature, de la Vald�ne tries, with sensitivity and patience, to find his, and perhaps society&#39;s, place in the natural world. &#34;A classic that compares well with Turgenev&#39;s A Sportsman&#39;s Notebook . . . simply and beautifully written.&#34;-The Bloomsbury Review; &#34;For a Handful of Feathers is an American classic . . . a book as unapologetic as it is thoughtful about blood sport . . . . the verbal spark and pace of a fine novel.&#34;-Gray&#39;s Sporting Journal; &#34;A gem that will appeal not only to hunters but to all readers who love the land.&#34;-Publishers Weekly.</p><p>Introduced to hunting at the age of seven, the author continues to pursue the sport. He owns an 800-acre farm in northern Florida, where he raises his favorite game bird, bobwhite quail. Here he reflects on a way of life that reconciles hunting with preservation of land and wildlife. Valdene offers an interesting glimpse of wildlife management-building a favorable habitat for quail by planting trees and shrubs, dividing fields, building dams and employing controlled burning. He writes about his dogs and other animals attracted to the farm. He takes us through the bobwhite's year, from nesting to maturity to the pot (with recipes).

Prose briefly gained the high ground in the second half of the nineteenth century, but poetry again became dominant in the 'Silver Age' (the early twentieth century), when belief in reason and progress yielded once more to a more magical view of the world. During the Soviet era, poetry became a dangerous, subversive activity; nevertheless, poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Anna Akhmatova continued to defy the censors. This anthology traces Russian poetry from its Golden Age to the modern era, including work by several great poets - Georgy Ivanov and Varlam Shalamov among them - in captivating modern translations by Robert Chandler and others. The volume also includes a general introduction, chronology and individual introductions to each poet.</p> <p>Robert Chandler is an acclaimed poet and translator.

Famed for his stirring sermons, Edwards remains a significant influence on modern religion, and this in-depth analysis of Calvinist beliefs represents his most important contribution to Christian thought.<br>Romans 9:16 ("It is not of him that willeth") serves as the text for Edwards' examination of the nature and state of man's will. Written in 1754 while the author served as a missionary to Native Americans, this polemic raises timeless questions about desire, choice, good, and evil. Edwards contrasts the opposing Calvinist and Arminian views of free will and addresses issues related to God's foreknowledge, determinism, and moral agency. His copious quotations from scripture, along with citations from the works of Enlightenment thinkers, support a thought-provoking exploration of mankind's fallen state and the search for salvation.</p><p>It is appropriate that Freedom of the Will should appear as Volume 1, for although it is not the first in the Edwards chronology, it is the work through which his fame has been most widely spread abroad, even to the multitudes who have known the book only by hearsay.Colonial-era preacher and theologian Jonathan Edwards (1703&#x2013;58) was a prolific author whose eloquent works inspired countless missionaries.

In this volume K. Stephen Prince explores the important role of the Radical Republicans in pressing for change during this period in a way designed to make the complexities of Reconstruction comprehensible to students. The Introduction introduces the Radical Republicans and details how Reconstruction grew from a complex negotiation among groups with often conflicting agendas. The documents, arranged in thematic and roughly chronological chapters, allow students to sift through the evolution of Radical Reconstruction and its aftermath through speeches, letters, press coverage, legislation, and contemporary illustrations. Document headnotes, a chronology, questions to consider, and a bibliography enrich students&#39; understanding of Radical Reconstruction.</p><p><p><b>K.

While aimed at the clergy, this profound spiritual work will also be of immense inspiration for laity in coming to a deeper understanding of the true nature and calling of the priesthood.<p>Echoing the thought and writing of St. Paul, Marmion stresses that the priestly life must be dominated by Christ and in constant dependence on His merits, His grace and His activity in the soul of the priest. In all his actions, in the sacred acts of worship, the administration of the sacraments, private prayer and devotions, and serving the various needs of his flock, Marmion says the priest must always see himself as the minister of the Savior, as&nbsp;<i>Alter Christus.</i></p></p><p></p><h2>The Quest For Hermes Trismegistus: From Ancient Egypt to the Modern World</h2><p><p>From the sands of Alexandria via the Renaissance palaces of the Medicis, to our own times, this spiritual adventure story traces the profound influence of Hermes Trismegistus -- the 'thrice-great one', as he was often called -- on the western mind. For centuries his name ranked among the most illustrious of the ancient world.</p> <p>Considered by some a contemporary of Moses and a forerunner of Christ, this almost mythical figure arose in fourth century BC Alexandria, from a fusion of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes. Master of magic, writing, science, and philosophy, Hermes was thought to have walked with gods and be the source of the divine wisdom granted to man at the dawn of time.</p> <p>Gary Lachman has written many books exploring ancient traditions for the modern mind. In <em>The Quest for Hermes Trismegistus</em>, he brings to life the mysterious character of this great spiritual guide, exposing the many theories and stories surrounding him, and revitalizing his teachings for the modern world.</p> <p>Through centuries of wars, conquests and religious persecutions, the fragile pages of the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus have still survived.

Known for his discourses on the intellectual and spiritual bankruptcy of the modern world, symbolism, tradition, and the inner or spiritual dimension of religion, this book is a compilation of his most important writings. A key component of his thought was the assertion that universal truths manifest themselves in various forms in the world&#39;s religions and his writings on Hinduism, Taoism, and Sufism are particularly illuminating in this regard.</p><p>Born in France, Rene Guenon was the author of over 24 books. Editor John Herlihy has written for such traditional journals as Sacred Web and Sophia, as well as writing several books that include Borderlands of the Spirit, and Wisdom&#39;s Journey. He currently works as a lecturer in Abu Dhabi, UAE.</p><h2>The Quest for the Trinity: The Doctrine of God in Scripture, History and Modernity</h2><p>The doctrine of the Trinity was settled in the fourth century, and maintained, with only very minor disagreement or development, by all strands of the church&#x2015;Western and Eastern, Protestant and Catholic&#x2015;until the modern period. In the twentieth century, there arose a sense that the doctrine had been neglected and stood in need of recovery. In <em>The Quest for the Trinity</em>, Holmes takes us on a remarkable journey through 2,000 years of the Christian doctrine of God. We witness the church's discovery of the Trinity from the biblical testimony, its crucial patristic developments, and medieval and Reformation continuity. We are also confronted with the questioning of traditional dogma during the Enlightenment, and asked to consider anew the character of the modern Trinitarian revival. Holmes's controversial conclusion is that the explosion of theological work in recent decades claiming to recapture the heart of Christian theology in fact deeply misunderstands and misappropriates the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. Yet his aim is constructive: to grasp the wisdom of the past and, ultimately, to bring a clearer understanding of the meaning of the present.</p><p><strong>Stephen R. Holmes</strong> (Ph.D., King's College London) is senior lecturer in systematic theology at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. His books include <em>Listening to the Past: The Place of Tradition in Theology</em> (Paternoster and Baker, 2002) and <em>Christian Doctrine: A Reader</em>, edited with Lindsey Hall and Murray Rae (SCM, 2010)."In summary, <em>The Quest for the Trinity</em> is a positive contribution to Trinitarian theology. . . . Ultimately, I hope it leads more people to a deeper Christian understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity&#x2015;a central truth of the faith." (Rev. Shane Lems, Modern Reformation, September/October 2014)<br><br>"Trinitarian theology has been a rallying cry for a particular constructive project in modern dogmatics. . . . In this volume, Holmes sets out a rather different account, one which tracks the tradition with greater care. This will in all likelihood be a healthy corrective to some enamored with an inflated or hypertrophied trinitarian theology." (Oliver Crisp, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In this lively and engrossing book, Stephen Holmes charts the development of the doctrine of the Trinity . . . calling into question some established conventions about the history of trinitarian theology. This is a work of considerable theological intelligence and historical discrimination; it will enjoy a wide readership." (John Webster, University of Aberdeen)<br><br>"What Holmes accomplishes is a challenge to much of current theology. He lays down this challenge clearly and with great documentation. In the course of his argument, Holmes makes admirably clear why even abstruse differences matter in how we live our lives of faith." (Ellen K. Wondra, Anglican Theological Review, 96.4)<br><br>"It is rare to write something which can be both a textbook and a real intervention in a debate, but Steve Holmes has pulled it off. As a textbook for serious students, this is superb, covering the history of the doctrine in a way that is fresh, illuminating, concise and intelligent. I wish we had had it sooner." (Karen Kilby, University of Nottingham)<br><br>"Stephen Holmes's book is brilliant in so many ways: provocative, timely, historically nuanced, theologically insightful, academically courageous and wonderfully sane. This book is must reading for all interested not only in the ongoing scholarly debate about trinitarian theology, but also for those concerned that their worship of the triune God echoes, in some meaningful ways, the voices of the saints throughout the ages." (Kelly M. Kapic, Covenant College)<br><br>"The story that Holmes tells, a story of tradition lost not retrieved, is a sad account indeed, and accurate. It is hoped that in light of this narrative, evangelical theologians will return to the rich trinitarian tradition of the Cappadocians, Augustine and the Reformers. When evangelicals return to this tradition they will drink from wells they did not dig and eat from trees they did not plant. Most importantly, they will be returning the church to the heart of the Christian tradition, the trinitarian God who is revealed in Scripture." (J. T. English with Glenn R. Kreider, Bibliotheca Sacra, April-June 2014)<br><br>"I recommend the reading of this book to those who want to understand not only the differences between the classical and modern renditions of the doctrine of the Trinity, but also to better understand the presuppositional differences behind such interpretations." (Marcos Blanco, Journal of Asia Adventist Seminary, 16.1 (2013))<br><br>"By the end, Holmes offers readers both a survey and a critique. As a survey, it is a masterfully concise and nuanced exploration into the historical heart of Christian theology. As a critique, it is a timely challenge to prevailing historical narratives. . . . In academia, this text will serve as a valuable interlocutor for engaging contemporary trends, while also engendering substantial discussion among scholars, as it already has." (James A. Garcia, Trinity Journal, Fall 2017)</p><h2>Absolutely Lucy #6: Thanks to Lucy</h2><p><b>Be thankful for your furry friends in this Thanksgiving story of a boy and his beagle! <br></b> <br> Bobby has a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

"I'm afraid you just don't understand. I'm going to break your back!" <br><br>It was July of 1986 and I was lying in bed at the U.S. Air Force Regional Medical Center with excruciating pain and numbness running down my right leg into my foot and toes. The myelogram, a special X-ray of the spine, showed a large disc rupture between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. After two weeks of bedrest with no let up in the pain and numbness, it was time to go in and operate.<br><br>How did I end up in this mess, me, a doctor of all people? Besides the pain, it was embarrassing to be a patient in my own hospital!<br><br>To my best recollection, my back trouble began when I was about 21 years old. I was still in school when I took a job loading and unloading trucks at a large warehouse to help support myself. I put in long, grueling days that involved a lot of lifting. It seemed like the "manly" thing to do, and besides, I was young and strong and enjoyed sweating and doing hard physical labor. I was at that age when I thought I was invincible. I never said no to work of any kind. In fact, I never said no to much of anything, and that, I discovered later, was a major drawback to the future health of my spine.<br><br>On the job, one of the games we played in our spare time was King of the Warehouse. In this test of male macho strength, we would stand at opposite ends of the warehouse, lower our shoulders, and charge at each other like human battering rams, trying to knock each other over. Having been a surfer and a football player, I had good balance, timing, and strength. Additionally, I loved contact sports.<br><br>My boss, Bob, at 6'5" and 305 lbs, loved to square off against me, even though he could never defeat me. As we charged from opposite corners of the warehouse like a couple of raging bulls, I would come up on him from underneath, flicking my shoulder and smacking into him at the last possible moment. Upon impact, Bob would be sent flying. <br><br>One day, however, while playing this game, things didn't quite work out right for me. As Bob and I squared off in opposite corners prior to charging, I was feeling a little tired. When we slammed into each other my timing was slightly off. I knocked him down anyway, but absorbed the entire force of the blow in my lower back. That night I went home feeling a little stiffer than usual. <br><br>The next day in chemistry lab at UCLA, while bending over to get my glassware from the bottom drawer of my desk, I felt an electric shock travel clear up through my neck and into my head. It was a sudden, jolting sensation. In an instant, my legs gave out beneath me as I found myself sitting on the floor with both feet splayed out in front of me. There was no strength in my legs whatsoever. Strangely, there was no pain either. I brushed myself off, stood up, and as there were no residual symptoms, I decided to continue on with my activities as if everything were fine. I completely dismissed the significance of this event. To this day, I have never told a soul, not even my doctors.<br><br>Less than two years later, while wheeling a half-ton operating room table into one of the operating rooms at UCLA, my back did something funny again. As I returned to a standing position after bending down, I found I couldn't straighten up all the way, as if someone had jammed a broomstick up my hind quarters. It was rather unnerving. "I certainly can't resume my duties in this condition," I thought to myself. I ducked into a vacant room and cautiously backed up to the side of another operating table. Reaching down with my arms, I forced myself into a backbend as far as I could go until I heard a "pop." Miraculously, my back had snapped back into proper alignment. I was both grateful and relieved to find that now I could straighten up and move without any restrictions. Once again I went back to work, resuming my normal duties as if nothing had happened.<br><br>Two years later, during my first year in medical school, I found myself alone and isolated in a strange city. Philadelphia, where I was now living, was experiencing its worst winter in 25 years. I was an hour and a half away from school by rail commute and the trains kept breaking down because of the deep snows and sub-zero temperatures. I was also in the middle of a strained relationship that eventually broke apart.<br><br>By itself, the first year in medical school is emotionally demanding. With these complications, however, my standing as a first year medical student was in serious jeopardy, especially since I couldn't get to class for lectures and labs. On the occasions that I did make it into school when the trains were running, I worked off the stress by playing basketball. <br><br>During one basketball game, while coming down for a rebound, my back went out just like it had done that day in the operating room two years before. This time, however, I couldn't straighten myself up and pop my back into place.<br><br>I showered and then grabbed my books and athletic bag with great difficulty. My body was stuck in a bent-over position. Hobbling to the curb outside of the medical school, I reasoned that if I could make it to the library across the street, perhaps my back would slip back into place on its own. I glanced up and saw an elderly woman crossing the street, slowly, but with ease. I was envious of her and at that moment, I felt very old. The bags I was carrying felt like they weighed two tons each. It was horrible to feel so helpless.<br><br>Somehow I made it to my seat in the library and while turning to my neighbor, Rob, who was also a medical student, I mentioned something about my back to him. Before I knew it, Rob had brought a wheelchair to my seat, insisting on wheeling me to the emergency room. As I reluctantly got in, I felt embarrassed being wheeled past all the other medical students, doctors, and nurses in the library.<br><br>In the emergency room, after a four-hour wait, I had X-rays taken. The orthopedic resident (doctor-in-training), after looking at the films in a back room, gave me all of two minutes of his time. He managed to tell me on his hurried way out of the examining room that despite my being bent over sideways and unable to straighten up, all that was wrong with me was a simple muscle strain. "But I'm sure I slipped a disc or something," I pleaded with the resident. "Then go to another orthopedic surgeon for a second opinion if you don't believe me," he said. In the midst of my pain and confusion, this was all he could offer me. <br><br>I refused to believe that all that was wrong with my back was a simple muscle strain. It was way too painful for that. As an athlete, I had experienced many muscle strains before. I had also separated both shoulders and had ruptured an inguinal hernia while lifting weights when I had the flu. I felt I wasn't a sissy and had a fairly good tolerance for pain. The diagnosis that the resident had given me, according to my understanding, did not correlate with my pain. I felt slighted. Either he was wrong, which I was determined to prove, or if he was right, then I was being a big baby about this whole thing. My mind was reeling at a hundred miles an hour trying to figure out what was going on with my body! Why was I in so much pain?<br><br>Dr. Hoffman, a professor of orthopedics at my medical school, had a private office not far from our school. He examined me briefly, reviewed my films, and concluded that it was possible that my disc had slipped. Inwardly, I was comforted that now my pain was justified with this more serious diagnosis. "You better take care of yourself or you're headed for an operation," he informed me. I didn't realize how prophetic his words were at the time.<br><br>I took a room near my medical school so I wouldn't have to deal with the hassles of the lengthy rail commute and the inconsistent trains. Unable to walk without support, I hobbled to class on a pair of crutches through the snow.<br><br>I phoned my father, a psychiatrist at the UCLA School of Medicine, and told him what had happened. "Are you under stress?" he asked. "Dad, I was coming down from a rebound while playing basketball. What the hell does stress have to do with it?!" I retorted angrily. It would take me 15 more years of back problems before I would realize the accuracy of my father's line of questioning.<br><br>After about a month, my back slowly improved. With this incident, however, I could no longer ignore my back. I needed to make some changes in my life if I wanted to avoid back surgery.<br><br>I enrolled in a yoga class to help bring some flexibility to my body and, in particular, to help me avoid the possibility of surgery. I also needed to deal with the anxiety of medical school and to learn how to relax and manage my stress. My yoga teacher assured me that if I were a sincere and regular student, all of these things were possible. While practicing yoga for the next five years, the condition of my back improved tremendously, and I did learn how to relax. <br><br>There were several setbacks during this period, however, as my back went out at inopportune times during periods of accumulated stress. The triggering events were physical traumas that while sometimes severe, could also be quite minor. One time my back went out lifting two full five-gallon water bottles, another time while wrestling with a friend, still another while bending down to pull on a boot. There seemed to be no correlation between the degree of trauma and the severity and duration of the pain. One thing seemed true, however; each time my back went out, it took longer to heal, and this had me worried. <br><br>In September of 1983 I entered the Air Force and was sent to the Philippines on active duty as payback for a military scholarship I was awarded during medical school. In this physically demanding environment, I ran 4-6 miles a day, swam 1,000 meters a day, biked 20-25 miles a day, and surfed 5-10 hours every weekend to maintain a warrior's level of fitness. For three full years, I participated in helicopter rescue missions and did extensive flying all over the Far East without any back problems whatsoever.<br><br>In May of 1986 however, dark, ominous clouds appeared on my horizon. My mother, brother, and father had all passed away in the last three years, and my wife at the time was at home dying of cancer, where I was trying to take care of her. <br><br>We had just purchased an expensive piece of property in Hawaii. The political climate of the Philippines was tense as the Marcos regime was ready to fall. The military was preparing for conflict. It was all too much, and like the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, my back went out as well. <br><br>To take my mind off my problems, I had flown down to a remote outer island with some friends. On the airplane ride back home, while merely turning around to talk to the person in the seat behind me, my back began to stiffen. After an hour or so, I was locked in a deathgrip of painful back muscle spasms and could barely shuZe my way off the plane.<br><br>With my back out, I tried to give it rest. The military, however, ordered me back to work. This added to the underlying tensions of being incapacitated. So once again I went into my familiar denial mode, put on a back brace, swallowed some pills, and tried to ignore the pain as I reported back to work like a good soldier.<br><br>My back was making its own efforts to heal, but the improvements were too slow for the fast pace of the Air Force. I felt pressured for time. I tried to accelerate the healing process with anything I could get my hands on -- pills, electronic devices such as infra-red lamps, TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators), heating pads, traction devices, hanging boots, braces, balms, and plenty of other stuff. <br><br>Sitting is the worst thing for an injured back, and having to man my desk for eight hours on end did not help my situation. As a member of the military, there was also the constant stress of war readiness, having to respond to contingencies on short notice. <br><br>In the previous three years, when my back had shown improvement, surfing had helped me overcome stress. I headed out to the ocean practically every weekend with a few buddies. Now, however, with my painful back, I found that I was unable to surf. I wondered how I would be able to manage my stress. <br><br>After more than a month, as stress kept building, I was eager to get back in the water. My back was still pretty bad, but the call of the ocean and the waves was strong. <br><br>On a chance visit to Base Operations, headquarters for all flight operations including the latest weather information, I saw a satellite photo of a huge typhoon that was heading our way. I could tell from the storm's size and direction that the waves were going to be good on the weekend. I couldn't resist. I decided to go surfing. <br><br>After a three-hour drive, when I finally got to the beach, my back was stiff and sore. I had no right to be there, but in my sheer pig-headed stupidity, I told myself that this would be good for me. As I carried my board to the water's edge, I told myself that I would be careful once I was in the water. <br><br>In the water, lying flat on my board while paddling out, felt good because now all the weight was off my spine. But I had made one fatal mistake. In my haste to get out in the water, I had failed to apply wax to the back part of my board. In the surfer's world, wax is more valuable than gold because it keeps you from slipping on your board. <br><br>While standing up on the first wave that I paddled for, my rear foot slid off the back of the board as I did the splits. I experienced intense pain as I heard a popping sound. At that very moment I knew I was in trouble, that I had made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. <br><br>The next day my right leg was numb and painful down to the toes. Because of my medical training, I was pretty sure that I had ruptured a disc in the lower part of my spine. It was time to see our neurosurgeon at the Air Force Regional Medical Center, Dr. Roberto Masferrer. <br><br>After Dr. Masferrer examined me, I was admitted to the hospital where the myelogram confirmed the presence of a large ruptured disc. My worst fears were true; it was decided that I would need surgery. This is where my story began.<br><br>After my surgery, the pain and numbness down my leg was greatly diminished. What a relief! But the pain in my back was excruciating. My back now had a huge hole in it. There was a gap between the rear portions of the two vertebrae where Dr. Masferrer had to cut away the bone to get to the ruptured disc. I thought the removed portions of bone would be rewired back in place. I was wrong. They were thrown in the garbage can and muscle was sewn together to cover the hole. I realized then that what Dr. Masferrer said was true. My back was indeed broken! <br><br>Upon release from the hospital, I was instructed not to drive or climb any stairs for one month. Two days later, I was driving my car and got locked out of my office at the hospital, so I had to use the stairs. <br><br>At home I had a pair of hanging boots that I used to stretch out my back. Following the axiom "physician heal thyself," I decided that I could give myself traction and get an upper body workout at the same time by hanging upside down while holding small dumbbell weights in my hands. Can you imagine the stupidity? Predictably, I never even made it that far!<br><br>Only three days out of the hospital, standing in the checkout line of our base's only department store with 30 pounds of dumbbell weights in my arms, I felt the left side of my back collapse.<br><br>As I stood there grimacing in pain, not speaking a word, ...</p><h2>The Good Husband Guide: 19 Tips for Domestic Bliss</h2><p>&#x201c;A woman&#x2019;s home is her domain, and as such, she should be treated like a queen.&#x201d; This fun, retro volume shows husbands how to keep Her Royal Highness happy, and her tiara shiny and sparkling.

Frustrated, he did not play again for six months; when he did he carded a 77. Determined to understand why he was able to shave nearly 40 strokes off his score, Kelley spent three decades of trial and error to unlock the answer and to recapture that one wonderful day when golf was easy and enjoyable. In 1969, Kelley self- published his findings in <i>The Golfing Machine: The Computer Age Approach to Golfing Perfection</i>. <br><br> The bestselling instruction books of the day required golfers to conform their swings to the author's ideals, but Homer Kelley configured swings to fit every golfer. He found an enthusiastic disciple in a Seattle teaching pro named Ben Doyle, who in turn found an eager student in 13-year-old prodigy Bobby Clampett. Clampett's initial success in amateur golf shined a bright spotlight on Homer Kelley and <i>The Golfing Machine</i>, but when the young star suffered a painfully public collapse and faltered as a pro, critics were quick to blast Kelley and his complex and controversial ideas. With exclusive access to Homer Kelley's archives, author Scott Gummer paints a fascinating picture of the man behind the machine, the ultimate outsider who changed the game once and for all of us.</p><p>Ever since Homer Kelley first published <i>The Golfing Machine </i>in 1969, people have been clamoring for a book that explains his theories in easier-to-understand terms. My book is not <i>The Golfing Machine for Dummies.</i><br><br>As advertised, my book tells the untold story of golf's most under appreciated genius. The reviews have been exceptionally positive, save for a few from readers who judged the book solely by the title. My book is a narrative story spanning 100 years, not a how-to manual.<br><br>I have included a chapter that explains in layman's terms why Kelley's theories were revolutionary, but my book is intended to enlighten and entertain. Prospective buyers seeking golf improvement should instead buy the latest edition of Homer's work.<br><br>The <b>New York Times </b>review offered an apropos perspective on what this book is all about:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is most worthy as an engaging and warm story of a simple but complex man obsessed with the simplicities and complexities of golf...Read the book and see for yourself. It is a tale that at least adds a charming piece to the puzzle."<br><br>I invite your thoughts and questions and can be reached via my Web site.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Scott Gummer<i>"The Golfing Machine</i> is one of the most important works in golf instruction of the 20th century. The quest by Homer Kelley to seek the truth has infiltrated down into many teaching philosophies...I know it has mine! Scott Gummer has done a great job in bringing the mythical figure of Homer Kelley to life in this book."<br> <b>David Leadbetter</b><p> </p><p> "Scott Gummer has done a masterful job at a daunting task: solving the riddle of the man who solved (he thought) the riddle of the golf swing. <i>Homer Kelley's Golfing Machine</i> is a sad and funny story beautifully told."<br> <b>Curt Sampson, author of <i>Hogan</i></b></p><p> </p><p> PRAISE FOR <i>THE SEVENTH AT ST.
